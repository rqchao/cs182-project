Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!\", 'Shiny, no!', \"Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window!\", 'I gotcha, you little rascal.

Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye.', \"Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!\", 'I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.', \"You promise you won't laugh?  Okay, here goes.

Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.\", 'He was big and mean.

Yeah, he never knew what his him.', 'I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...', 'That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy.', \"Slugger, that's me.  What the?\", 'Hi, Sandy.', \"Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need them. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.\", \"Lose?

Crazfish!', 'It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.', \"Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner.\", 'Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios!', \"Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking.\", \"That's right.\", \"Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.\", 'All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?', \"Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum.\", \"Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  Don't worry, I'll save you. I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!\", 'Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...', \"I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real...\", \"Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.\", \"Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walking, like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?\", 'One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord.

Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tear ducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient.\", \"Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible.

I won't let you touch Gary!\", 'S.D.E. and S.E.?', \"Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?\", \"Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?\", \"Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?\", 'Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.', \"We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.\", 'You built us a trophy case for when we win?

Let's go, Patrick.\", 'Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.', 'Yep.', \"You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.\", \"How'd the audition go, Squidward?\", 'Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?', 'Yes, yes I am.', 'Ready!', \"How'd you know?\", \"I guess they're happy.\", \"Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.\", 'Well, I just...', 'You know what, Squidward?', \"I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.\", 'Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.', 'Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight.', \"Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.\", 'Uh, Squidward?', 'Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?', \"Oh, thank you, you're too kind.

We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!  I guess the road smoothed out.  That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us!\", \"No, Patrick! No!  Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub.  Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter...\", 'Say, where did you get the firewood?  You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something!  Hey Patrick, nice job.', \"Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water.

You're not properly seasoned!\", 'No!', 'Gotcha!', 'I got you!', 'Did what?', \"Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry.\", 'What about Patrick? Does he have to find his own flowers, too?', \"Patrick, that's not a nose, that's a...  ...hermit crab.\", \"It's not so abnormal to be noseless. Just look around.

Plotting his oppression!', \"I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.\", 'Yep!', 'Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?', \"I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?\", 'Like this, Squidward?', \"Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.\", 'That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.', \"Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um...

This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward.  He had some very important news he was just bursting to share.  He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet.  Specifically, what not to feed them.  The list was very thorough.  Needless to say, this is all very enlightening.  It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique--  Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are.  Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short.  And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year,  cleaning day!  Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab,  and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots.  Ah yes, cleaning day.\", \"Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right.  Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward.

How could you?!', \"Hi, Squidward. How's it going?\", 'What for?', \"Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you.  Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary.  Now, that would have been really embarrassing.\", 'People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.', 'Squidward! How could you?!', \"Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone.  He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is.  This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot.
