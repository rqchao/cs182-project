[Plankton laughs, squirts out chum onto a plate, smells the chum and laughs again. Karen comes out of the door.]
Karen: What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?
Plankton: You may thank my new and original idea, darling. [Karen is confused] Free samples! [Karen is still confused]
Karen: New and original, my exhaust fan.
Plankton: Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!
Karen: You mean the smell?  [Karen starts laughing] Smell.
Plankton: No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free! [scene cuts in Chum Bucket, Plankton is sitting on a bench near the store with free samples] Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!
Nat: Hey, what did he just say it was?
Plankton: I just said they're free!
Nat: Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case... [everyone goes in line] So glad I actually left my house today.
[everyone gets some chum]
Plankton: That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.
Sally: What is it?
Shubie: Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!
Sally: Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!
[everyone starts putting the chum in their mouths then gets surprised]
Plankton: Eat up. [Plankton laughs, and Shubie holds her stomach, Nancy and Frank turn green, Nancy's hair stands on end, everyone is nauseous] I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger. [Plankton runs]
Nat: Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and... [Nat is nauseous again, and he speaks in a deep voice] get him.
[everyone, still sick, chases Plankton. Patrick comes up to the stand]
Patrick: "Free samples". [Patrick eats one of the chum and enjoys it] Yum! [Patrick eats more chum]
[everyone is by the Chum Bucket. Lifeguard pounds on the door]
Frank: Hey, you!, I know you're in there!
Plankton: It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
Karen: If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.
Plankton: Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen. [Plankton gets an idea] Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!
Harold: Free Krabby Patties?!
[everyone runs to the stand again]
Nat: Hey, what's all the hubble?
Nazz: Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!
Plankton: That's it. [laughs]
Frank: Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?
Plankton: [sweats nervously] Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.
Lifeguard: Oh, okay.
[everyone eats the chum, Frank's eyes pop out and his arms fall out, everyone else falls on Frank. Plankton comes out of the sewer]
Plankton: Krabby Patties, anyone?
[other people eat the chum, as a fish hurls]
SpongeBob: [singing] I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping. [SpongeBob sees people by the Krusty Krab] Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.
Nat: You!
Frank: You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!
[SpongeBob gets scared and slides into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Over here boy. [Mr. Krabs is hiding by the table]
SpongeBob: What is going on out there?
Mr. Krabs: The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why. [Lifeguard throws a brick with a note through the window] "Because the Krabby Patty is terrible". [gasps] Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?
SpongeBob: I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?
Mr. Krabs: Fine. [Mr. Krabs lowers the price from $2.99 to $2.98] How about that? [one of the customers throws rocks] I'm ruined! [Mr. Krabs starts crying]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.
Mr. Krabs: I'm all ears.
SpongeBob: We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr- [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's lips]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you say it, boy!
SpongeBob: It's the only way, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob is holding a stand] Alright, sir, it's time.
Mr. Krabs: Time? But it's too soon. [Mr. Krabs jumps to the stand] I'm not ready to let them go free.
SpongeBob: But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
Mr. Krabs: I don't remember saying anything like that.
SpongeBob: I do. [SpongeBob pulls the sheet off, Mr. Krabs screams] Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: No! [Mr. Krabs tries to run but his claws are in chains]
SpongeBob: It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties! [the word "patties" echoes]
Mr. Krabs: Whew, uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed! [starts crying again]
Plankton: I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns. [SpongeBob opens the small doors and plays the calliope] No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.
Shubie: Hey look, Billy, a calliope.
SpongeBob: Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.
Squidward: I can't feel my legs.
SpongeBob: Here let me help you, Squidward.
 [SpongeBob pulls Squidward's nose, Squidward goes in front of Billy]
Baby Billy: Look, mama, a monkey! [Billy throws a penny at Squidward] Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!
[Squidward takes off his suit and gives it to Baby Billy]
Squidward: I quit!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!
[Plankton laughs]
Plankton: Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!
[SpongeBob pulls up Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.
Mr. Krabs: Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.
SpongeBob: New... Different... [SpongeBob gets an idea] That's it!
Mr. Krabs: Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room.
Narrator: Five minutes later.
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!
Nazz: You can't be serious.
Frank: I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.
Nazz: No! Wait!
Nat: Let him go, it's too late.
SpongeBob: All new free Krabby Patties!
Frank: Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose. [everyone gasps, Frank eats half of the Krabby Patty] Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay! [Frank's shirt turns pink then normal]
Nazz: Did he just say it was good?
[Frank finishes the other half of the Krabby Patty]
Frank: Woohoo! [Frank dances] 
Nat: Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!
[everyone eats the Krabby Patties, Henry-Bart's eyes turn into a thumbs up, money comes out of his skin]
Henry-Bart: I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy? [Henry-Bart throws money on SpongeBob]
Frank: Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yum! [Frank goes like a rocket] Hey, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more! [Frank goes in the stand and takes two Krabby Patties]
[Nat and the Fish's heads turn into arms and give a high-five]
Nat and Nazz: Now that's what I'm talking about!
[Nat and Nazz's head turn back to normal, they get a briefcase from their pockets]
Nat: Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties! [Nat and Nazz dump the money on SpongeBob]
[Plankton with a cellphone]
Plankton: Don't worry, Karen, I'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished. [laughs, and then a dollar bill lands on Plankton] What the...?! [gasps]
SpongeBob: It's working!
Plankton: No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember? [a dump trunk dumps money] Uh-oh. [the money lands on Plankton] 
[a helicopter dumps a bag full of money on SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs is just walking and then a dollar lands on his nose. His eyes pop out and he screams so loudly, Plankton comes out of the money, and Mr. Krabs jumps on the money and laughs]
SpongeBob: We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!
Mr. Krabs: Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.
SpongeBob: Oh, money angels, can I make one?
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in! [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Plankton screams because Mr. Krabs is sitting on him] Did you hear what?
SpongeBob: Hear what?
Mr. Krabs: Good point. [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue laughing]
