[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with an orange balloon. They take a deep breath and hold it until they reach Sandy's treedome. They enter the dome, put on their water helmets, and spit out water for them to breathe. Sandy is welding some contraptions together for her latest invention. SpongeBob taps her shoulder.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Check out our new balloon.
Patrick: Her name is Squeaky. [rubs the balloon and squeaks]
Sandy: Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.
Both: [exclaim] New invention?!
Sandy: See?
[Sandy shows them her new invention as her wheel turns making a colorful vortex.]
Both: Ooh.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts. [puts her hand through the portal and takes a bag of nuts from a sleeping old man] Yoink!
Old coot: Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!
[Sandy pulls her arm back from the portal with a bag of nuts and eats some.]
Sandy: Pretty nifty, huh?
SpongeBob: [looking at the control panel with Patrick] Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do? [pulls on levers] Vroom, vroom, vroom! [screeches and presses some buttons and a rope]
[Patrick makes beeping sounds as he pushes several buttons. Both SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and continue playing on the control panel.]
Sandy: Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you heard Sandy. [presses buttons as he talks] We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this! [pushes buttons with his feet and toes]
Patrick: Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob. [pushes a lever and pulls another; pushes several buttons with his buttocks] Or..or this! [presses more buttons with his buttocks]
SpongeBob: And under no circumstances should you ever touch this. [pushes red button] Boink.
[Suddenly, the alarm goes off and the button activates the vortex.]
Both: Whoa. [stammering]
Sandy: [comes out of her tree and gasps] Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!
SpongeBob: Ooh, so swirly.
Patrick: Look at all the colors.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely hypnotized by the vortex's swirling colors and begin to walk closer to it like zombies.]
Sandy: Whatever you do, don't walk into it!
Patrick: Can we skip into it?
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip up to the vortex.]
Sandy: SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop] Now turn around. [SpongeBob and Patrick turn around] Now walk.
[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their right legs and instead of walking over to Sandy, they walk backwards into the vortex. The vortex closes.]
Sandy: [gasps] Oh. [groans] Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream as they fly through the swirling vortex. They travel to several different universes until finally, they fall through the vortex ending up in a blank, white dimension.]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh! [crashes to the ground and Patrick falls on top of him]
Patrick: Goodness. [comes out of SpongeBob's body] Mm, mmm.
SpongeBob: [looks around] Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one.
Patrick: Must be the boring dimension. Let's go home.
SpongeBob: Maybe there's an exit this way. [walks to the left, but ends up going back to Patrick] Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn. [walks to the right, but ends up going back to Patrick again] Huh? [sprints around and around, but no matter how he walks in the strange dimension, he always ends up in the same area] Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!
Patrick: [sobs] I can't take it! Let me out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically run up, down, left, right, and loop-de-loop in many attempts to escape. But their efforts were no avail. SpongeBob screeches lines across the floor as he bumps into Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick take notice of the lines moving.]
Both: Hmm. Huh? [the lines crawl away] Ooh!
[SpongeBob draws another line and it crawls away.]
SpongeBob: Mm...[laughs] Oh, Patrick, watch this! [sticks his hand in his head] Boink. [pulls out a giant pencil that looked almost like the magic pencil from Frankendoodle. He draws a boatmobile above them. The boat revs up its engine and runs over Patrick, leaving him tire marks on his face.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, sorry!
Patrick: [gets up] Heh, draw some more!
[SpongeBob draws a door similar to his front door of his house. He opens the door and reveals a living similar to the one at his house.]
SpongeBob: Nice décor. [closes the door] Hmm. [draws a doodle version of his house]
[SpongeBob then draws a doodle version of Squidward's house and Patrick's house.]
Patrick: Oh, my house! [jumps and hugs his doodle house until suddenly, all three houses are being lifted in the air] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!
SpongeBob: Oops, forgot to draw the ground.
[SpongeBob draws a horizontal line for the ground. The three doodle houses drop back down, crushing Patrick under one. Patrick pulls himself out and his stomach rumbles.]
Patrick: Ahh.
Patrick's tum-tum: I'm starving.
SpongeBob: No problem. [draws the Krusty Krab work hat] Two patties coming right up! [draws a doodle Krabby Patty] Your doodle patty, sir. [draws himself a doodle Krabby Patty]
[They both eat the doodle patties, however, they tasted horrible.]
Patrick: [spits it out] Tastes weird.
SpongeBob: Yeah, they are a little dry. [his doodle patty and doodle hat crumble to dust]
Patrick: I miss real Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: I miss Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: I miss Sandy.
SpongeBob: I miss Gary.
Both: I miss Squidward!
Patrick: You know who I miss most of all? [takes the pencil and draws a mini version of DoodleBob] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: But Patrick, I'm right here.
[DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Aww, isn't he cute?
Patrick: How do you do?
[DoodleBob babbles and jumps onto Patrick. Patrick hugs DoodleBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.
[DoodleBob disappears.]
Patrick: Oh, oh! He disappeared! [reappears in Patrick's belly] Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!
SpongeBob: He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.
[DoodleBob multiplies into numerous mini DoodleBobs.]
Doodle Clones: You doodle!
[The Doodle clones all scramble on Patrick's belly while babbling, which at first results in tickling him. Then, without warning, they all start biting him like mosquitoes.]
Patrick: Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob! [the mini DoodleBobs continue biting him]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [draws a hose and sprays water on Patrick to wash the DoodleBobs off; leaving him a hole in his stomach]
Patrick: Oh, thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: You're welcome. [gets up] I guess we need to be more careful.
[DoodleBob comes back to life in the puddle and comes out in a much taller form. He takes the pencil and draws two angry eyebrows on his face. He quickly turns over to SpongeBob and Patrick with the pencil, scaring them out of their wits. DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.
[DoodleBob draws an anvil and it falls on top of SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Patrick: Oh, run!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run away from DoodleBob. DoodleBob draws a tank over them. SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a piano and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a safe and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to run with DoodleBob in hot pursuit.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [takes off his left shoe and sharpens it into a pencil point] We'll have to fight doodle with doodle. [draws three doodle versions of Mr. Krabs, Gary, and Squidward] Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad! [Doodle Squidward, Doodle Gary, and Doodle Mr. Krabs come to life] Attack!
[The three doodles run over to fight DoodleBob. But DoodleBob grabs Doodle Squidward and whacks Doodle Mr. Krabs and Doodle Gary. Then he draws angry eyebrows and mustaches on all three of them, making them evil. All three doodles turn against SpongeBob and Patrick and go to attack them.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, run! [Doodle Gary jumps on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Ooh! [Doodle Mr. Krabs pinches Patrick with his claws]
[Doodle Squidward kicks SpongeBob and Patrick in the faces. All three doodles run away and DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm going in. [gives Patrick his shoe] Cover me. [pulls up his pants and runs over to DoodleBob]
Patrick: [draws a blanket] I gotcha, buddy! [puts to blanket over SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Huh? Whoa! [bumps into his doodle house and pulls over the blanket] What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?
Patrick: [being held by DoodleBob] Over here.
SpongeBob: Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!
[DoodleBob draws rope around Patrick. He babbles as he looms the pencil over SpongeBob, the tip near inches from his face. Then he draws a grave and a tombstone. He draws a coffin around SpongeBob and pushes him into the grave, burying him. DoodleBob drags Patrick and runs away with him. SpongeBob pops out from the grave.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[SpongeBob draws a telescope and sees DoodleBob in his drawn castle tying his prisoner, Patrick, to a flagpole.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you! [runs over to DoodleBob's castle]
Patrick: [From the distance] Good to know!
SpongeBob: Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of...[draws his armor suit] SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table! [jumps off his armor suit] Charge!
[DoodleBob launches flaming boulders with his catapult. SpongeBob dodges one.]
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! [a larger boulder crushes him]
[DoodleBob laughs. SpongeBob draws a door on the boulder and comes out unharmed.]
SpongeBob: Release my friend before I get really tough! [buffs up until his pecs get flabby]
[DoodleBob laughs and launches Patrick with the catapult.]
SpongeBob: [screams] I gotcha! I gotcha!
[Patrick crashes into SpongeBob.]
Both: Oof!
[DoodleBob then draws stamper and creates a whole army of DoodleBobs. They run out from the castle to attack SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: [takes off his shoe and draws a line] In here.
[SpongeBob and Patrick hide as DoodleBob and his army run past them. SpongeBob and Patrick come out.]
SpongeBob: Phew.
Patrick: [loudly] Nah-nah, you missed us! [through megaphone] Now you gotta kiss us!
[Patrick's idiotic outburst attracted DoodleBob's attention and commands his army to go back.]
Patrick: Nah-nah...
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: What? [gasps and realizes his mistake]
[DoodleBob babbles as SpongeBob and Patrick cry and hug each other.]
SpongeBob: Oh, we'll never get back home!
Patrick: We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squeaky! [gasps] Squeaky! [takes off his show and draws a balloon] Grab on, buddy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick grab onto the balloon's string and they float away. DoodleBob attempts to grab them.]
SpongeBob: Too slow, DoodleBob!
[DoodleBob babbles.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob.
[DoodleBob commands his army to connect with each other to make him high enough to reach SpongeBob and Patrick. Once they reach them, DoodleBob grabs the balloon's string. SpongeBob takes off his shoe and draws some scissors.]
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick!
Patrick: [grabs the scissors] Oh, ooh, uh... snip! [cuts the string and he and SpongeBob fall down]
[DoodleBob and his army float far away with the balloon until they are out of sight.]
SpongeBob: Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.
Patrick: But we're still stuck here.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home. [gets an idea] Wait a minute, Patrick! [takes off his shoe and draws a doodle version of Sandy] Doodle us home, Sandy.
[Doodle Sandy takes SpongeBob's shoe and draws a vortex.]
Doodle Sandy: Bleeble blobble blortex!
Both: Yay! Thanks, Sandy!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Doodle Sandy's vortex. Meanwhile, back at Sandy's treedome, Sandy is struggling to figure out a way to enter the vortex to retrieve SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hmm, mm-hmm... [the vortex reactivates] What the—?
[SpongeBob and Patrick return home through the vortex, much to Sandy's shocking surprise.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, we're back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dry up. They take deep breathes and put their water helmets on.]
Sandy: I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?
SpongeBob: Sandy saved us. [he and Patrick leave]
Sandy: [confused] What? [the old man's hand appears through the vortex and taps Sandy's shoulder] Huh? Huh?
Old coot: Give me back my nuts!
[Sandy gulps nervously. The screen turns black. DoodleBob appears and writes "The End" on the screen, ending the episode.]
