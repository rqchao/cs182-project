[scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune.]
Squidward: There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. [starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
SpongeBob: Wey, wook. It's Widward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: [growls]
Patrick: Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: What's that supposed to beâ€” some kind of stupid secret code?
SpongeBob: We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? [laughs] Moron... [laughs again] as a requirement. [laughs again]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Patrick: [whispering to SpongeBob] What did he say?
SpongeBob: [whispering to Patrick] I don't know. Something about his nose?
Patrick: [sticks his head out of the "Clubhouse" and talks to Squidward] Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.
Squidward: Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? [takes off his hat and starts to climb up the "Clubhouse"] Why, you should be begging me to join!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Patrick: That's what we've been trying to tell you!
SpongeBob: We've been stuck up here for three days.
Patrick: We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Squidward: [sneers]
SpongeBob: Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing] Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!
Squidward: SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!! [grabs a stalk beside the one holding up the "Clubhouse" and pulls it while the other one is going down] I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! [gets to the floor but the stalk snaps and the stalk holding up the "Clubhouse" flings back very fast and the "Clubhouse" flies off it. He starts screaming]
Nancy: Whoa!
Frank: Make a wish, honey.
[Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! [they victory screech]
Squidward: Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Patrick: What happened?
[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying]
Squidward: Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-T?!
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.
Patrick: Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.
[camera zooms in on Squidward's head which deflates]
Squidward: Well... this is the end. [head falls on the ground]
SpongeBob: No it's not, Squidward!
Patrick: [building coffins] It's not?
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! [patting Squidward's head] As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they do the victory screech again]
SpongeBob: And besides, we have this! [pulls out a conch shell]
Squidward: What's that?
Patrick: Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
SpongeBob: Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]
Magic Conch: Maybe someday.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling] Oooohhhh!
Squidward: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
Patrick: The shell knows all!
SpongeBob: Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
Patrick: The shell has spoken!
Squidward: Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing]
Squidward: [growls] I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing]
Squidward: [growls again] All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! [starts walking away in the Kelp Forest] But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... [laughs] sad... [laughs again] clowns. [laughs again. Later, he began to run fast and grew scared and started panting rapidly] What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! [trips and falls] Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! [sees light] Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!! [he goes toward the light] I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!! [pumps fists in the air triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick; falls on the ground] Ohhh, there's no way out of here... [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire] How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? [spots a bug running around so he steps on it] Ah... [puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose] Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. [walks over to Patrick] How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. [walks away from Patrick] And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! [shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face] If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... [moves back to Club Squidward] that tells you nothing. [stirs the pan] As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky! [camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]
Scooter: DUDE! We're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! [presses the "Drop the Load" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Praise the Magic Conch! [victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them]
Squidward: Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
SpongeBob: It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward: Everything sure looks delicious. [gasps] Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! [smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out] Uh, hey, uh, [laughs] SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... [stammers] [While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Umm...uh..yeah?
SpongeBob: Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clink glasses] To the club! [victory screech]
Squidward: Yeah. [mimics the victory screech, weakly] Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... [runs to the table with all the food] All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
SpongeBob: Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
Patrick: [whispering] Maybe he's not a brother.
[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed]
Squidward: [chuckles] Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. [takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob] Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Magic Conch: Neither.
Squidward: Oh. Then how about the soup?
Magic Conch: I don't think so.
Squidward: [becomes annoyed] Could I have anything to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Patrick: [takes Magic Conch] Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: No.
Patrick: Hmm... [happily] Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: Yes.
Patrick: All right! [vacuums in the sandwich and burps] Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Give me that! [takes Magic Conch] Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat!?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Can't you say anything else but no?!
Magic Conch: Try asking again.
Squidward: [asks excitedly with a grin on his face] Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: [in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone] No!
[Squidward starts getting enraged.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right?
[Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably.]
Patrick: Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Kelp Forest Ranger: [offscreen] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?! [he reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty] Do you folks need some help?
Squidward: [gasps] I'm saved! [runs over to the forest ranger] You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Kelp Forest Ranger: Magic... Conch... Shell? [pulls out a Magic Conch Shell] You mean like this?! [says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they jump but they stop in midair] The Magic Conch! A club member!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [victory screech]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [victory screech]
Squidward: [dumbstruck] Uhhbuuuhhh...
Kelp Forest Ranger: My conch told me to come save you guys.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger: Hooray for the magic conches!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [we see Squidward in the background looking unhappy] All right, Magic Conch. What do we do now?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger: All hail the Magic Conch! [they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]
Squidward: All hail the magic conch! [sits down with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the Kelp Forest Ranger]
