[A sign that says "Fine Antiques For Sale" is put in Mr. Krabs' front yard. Mr. Krabs assembles a rug for the "antiques" to be put in.]
French Narrator: Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
Mr. Krabs: [digs in the trash and pulls out a broken razor] Disposable? Phooey. [grabs the trash can and puts all the items in it on his rug for his yard sale]
Narrator: For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure. [Mr. Krabs gets another trash can and dumps it on the rug. He sniffs the odor, then uses fresh scent odor spray and sprays it on the pile of trash]
Mr. Krabs: Open for business. [fish walks up] See anything you like?
Fish #1: Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella. [umbrella has holes in it]
Mr. Krabs: A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
Fish #1: Ten bucks? [opens up the umbrella] It's full of holes!
Mr. Krabs: It was the queen of Switzerland.
Fish #1: A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second! They don't have a queen!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
Fish #1: [hands money to Mr. Krabs] Deal! [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: [smells the money] Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker. [slurping in background]
SpongeBob: They taste even better. [SpongeBob and Patrick are licking lollipops] Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: Whatcha you doing?
Mr. Krabs: I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
SpongeBob: [grabs a plunger] Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?
Patrick: That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the plunger from SpongeBob] That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh... [turns the rubber part of the plunger upside-down] ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
Patrick: Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
Mr. Krabs: Five bucks.
Patrick: [gets out his money] I only got seven.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the money] Deal.
Patrick: Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper. [grabs his lollipop, now stuck on a pair of underwear, and licks it]
SpongeBob: Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
Mr. Krabs: That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: This hat says, "Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking." This hat was made for you, boy. [puts it on SpongeBob] You were born to wear this hat.
SpongeBob: Ee-hee, ooh...!
Mr. Krabs: A perfect fit, eh, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together! [sighs. His eyes fill up with joyful tears] How can I ever repay you?
Mr. Krabs: With 10 dollars.
SpongeBob: [reaches into his pocket and takes out some money] All I have is 5.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess it's no deal.
SpongeBob: I'll be right back. [zips home to get change out of the couch, in his shoe, and in his piggy bank then runs back to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?
Mr. Krabs: Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he and Patrick walk off]
Mr. Krabs: Don't mention it, boys. [chuckles] What a couple of rubes.
Fish #2: Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I am.
Fish #2: I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat. [holds up a picture of the hat that SpongeBob just bought]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh out.
Fish #2: Let me explain. [takes out some money] I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.
Mr. Krabs: [drools] Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
Fish #3: Not so fast. [elbows the other fish out of the way] I'll give you $1000 for such a hat. [Mr. Krabs is stammering and drooling]
Nat: I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat. [Mr. Krabs is drooling up a river]
Fred: [in a row boat] Sir? I'll give you a million dollars for that hat! [row boat drifts off]
Mr. Krabs: [runs off to find the hat, leaving a trail of drool behind] SpongeBob! [Cut to SpongeBob blowing bubbles with his new hat, in front of his house. Mr. Krabs is hiding behind a rock] There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
SpongeBob: Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
SpongeBob: Am I a pretty girl?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful. [mail fish looks at Mr. Krabs with his eyebrow raising] Uh... heh-heh. [SpongeBob laughs] All right, now give me the hat back.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through. [Thought bubble of earlier. SpongeBob gets the hat and sits down a few feet away from the curio stand] Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.
Mr. Krabs: Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
SpongeBob: I'm not? [Cut to later where SpongeBob is still blowing bubbles when Mr. Krabs shows up with a bag of hats]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Mr. Krabs: Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Novelty hats. [takes out a hat with a fan on top of it] How about this air-condition one? [turns it on and blows air really hard in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Seems a little dangerous. [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with a mixer on it]
Mr. Krabs: The juicer. [puts in a carrot and the juicer spits out carrot juice]
SpongeBob: Ooh... [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with the words 'FOXY GRANDPA' on it]
Mr. Krabs: Foxy Grandpa? [SpongeBob laughs] So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
SpongeBob: No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.
Mr. Krabs: I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option. [close-up on his mouth] I'm gonna have to scare it off of him. [Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob is snoring. Outside, Mr. Krabs runs up to his window with a fishing pole and a notepad. He draws a ghost on a page]  Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare 'im. [tears the page out of the pad, attaches it to the pole's hook, and throws the line into SpongeBob's window. He gives off a "haunting" moan]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! [piece of paper is on the opposite side, with the words "MILK EGGS CHEESE" written on it. SpongeBob screams]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not a shopping list... [turns paper around to show ghost] I'm a ghost!
SpongeBob: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs evilly] Now, listen, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: How do you know my name?! Who are you?!
Mr. Krabs: I am the ghost of soda drink hats. [hangs down another piece of paper with the soda drinking hat that SpongeBob has] I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.
SpongeBob: Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. It once belonged to some guy who's dead now.
SpongeBob: What guy?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty something.
SpongeBob: Smitty what?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
SpongeBob: He must've been number one.
Mr. Krabs: Number one in Boogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
SpongeBob: Immediately?
Mr. Krabs: Immediately...
SpongeBob: To its owner?
Mr. Krabs: Yes...
SpongeBob: Right now?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
SpongeBob: [walks up behind Mr. Krabs, covered in dirt and holding a shovel] Hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
SpongeBob: Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
Mr. Krabs: How did? I just... You did... I would... Gimme that shovel. [walks off to the cemetery]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! [Cut to Floater's Cemetery where eerie moaning is heard. A clam on a tree branch hoots like an owl]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Ducks as a bunch of clams are flying over him. Then a black snail growls at him] Ahh! [The black snail slithers away] Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones. [gate squeaks open] Ah! [hides behind a tombstone on a hill] What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here? [Sees Squidward crying as he walks up to a tombstone, puts flowers on it, then leaves. Mr. Krabs walks up to the tombstone Squidward was looking at and reads it] "Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams." What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster. [looks at the names on the different tombstones] Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh. No. No. Uh-uh. No. Not there. [Cut to later] I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. [thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. [thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: No, not that! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: [repeatedly] No, no, no, no, no! [third thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-
Mr. Krabs: [punches thought bubble away] Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find-- [he sees the tombstone and it shows his real name, Smitty Werben Man Jensen] The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am! [digs and hits something] Jackpot! [opens up the coffin] Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa. [takes head off with the hat on] Hey, come on, Smitty, let go! [takes his head off] Rest in pieces, Smitty. [jumps out of the hole] I got the million dollar hat. [lightning and thunder booms. Smitty stands up from his grave with his head in one hand]
Smitty: Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.
Mr. Krabs: What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
Smitty: I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, right. You and what army?
Smitty: [eerie moaning] Only the army of the living dead. [all the other dead bodies are walking towards Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
Smitty: That's disgusting! We just want the hat back.
Mr. Krabs: No flipping way! [takes the head of a swordfish and uses it as a sword] Back off! Back off, I say.
Smitty: Attack. [the zombies ready their weapons]
Mr. Krabs: Tallyho! [sword fights a few zombies] Look at me, I'm Errol Fin! [chops up more bodies] You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding. [sword fights them] Back to oblivion. [jumps over a group of zombies] Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha! [twirls around and destroys more of the zombies in the morning Mr. Krabs finishes destroying all the skeleton zombies and runs out of the cemetery] Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars! [runs back to his curio stand where the fish are talking altogether at once] Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars. [all of the fish laugh]
Fred: Yeah, you want that all at once?
Fish #3: One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!
Nat: Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless. [Bunch of soda drinking hats are in the dumpster. The fish crack up laughing. SpongeBob walks by with a hat with clapping hands on the top of it]
SpongeBob: Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. [laughs]
Nat: Now that's worth a million dollars. [SpongeBob laughs again and he leaves the background. Nat runs after him and the other fish follow] Hey, kid, wait up!
Fish #2: I saw him first!
Fish #3: I'll give you one billion dollars!
[Fred rows his row-boat along the ground to chase SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's a spirit breaker. [throws the soda drinking hat away and breaks down sobbing]
Squidward: [walks by with flowers in hand] What a baby. [walks off]
