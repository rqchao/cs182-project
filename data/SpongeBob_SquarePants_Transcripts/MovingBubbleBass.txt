Narrator: Snark Chat with Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. [audience clap] Great to have you back on the program.
Krabby Patty: Great to be here, BB.
Bubble Bass: Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.
Krabby Patty: Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund. [percussion sting] [laughter]
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass, who are you talking to down there?
Bubble Bass: Mother! Please stop trying to undermine my fantasy talk show! [Krabby Patty thuds] Mmph.
Mama Bass: You march yourself upstairs this instant! Take out the garbage, dry the dishes, and walk the worm!
Bubble Bass: Ooh, I don't feel like it!  Huh? [Mama Bass throws garbage, two dishes, and the worm at Bubble Bass] That tears it, Mother! [grunts] I am moving out! [slams the front door]
Mama Bass: Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing in the background] All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... [wagoon crashes into Bubble Bass]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [Bubble Bass grunts] Sorry, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: Why you two able-bodied idiots! I—  [gasps and giving an evil grin] Ooh. [Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely] Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn a free lunch?
Patrick: Freeeeeee lunch! [His head turns as if a balloon and then explodes]'
Bubble Bass:  All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick] Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.
SpongeBob: But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
Bubble Bass: Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.
SpongeBob: [beat horn blares from ship]  Oh, Patrick [puts a finger inside Patrick's mouth, causing him to fill up and release water]
Bubble Bass: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
Patrick: [grumbles trying to fit a stool into the box, breaking the stool in the process] [hums]
SpongeBob: Oh... [grunts] [puts on welder's helmet and turns on torch] [hums] [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pushes computers in the box grunting]
Patrick: [grunts] [water from toilet splashes] [toilet shatters]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Both: [both grunt trying to push wooden planks]
Patrick: [hits mail-box with an ax, causing clanging]
SpongeBob: [exclaims] [spits out mail]
Patrick: [gasps]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Patrick: All right, that's the last of it.
SpongeBob: Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
Patrick: [grunts] [part of the house clangs]
Kids: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Old Man Jenkins: [screams]
Both: [grunts]
SpongeBob: Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
Ms. Mildred: Walk around? Hmph, I'm Lady Upturn the 333rd, and you want me to walk around? [laughs] I'm afraid you just have to back it up.
SpongeBob: Back it up? [backup alarm blares] Okay. Back it up, Patrick.
Patrick: What'd you say?
SpongeBob: [grunts] Oh, oh, oh!
Patrick: [grunts] [giggles afterward]
SpongeBob: [pants] [screams]
Ms. Mildred: [screams] [grunts]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [exclaims]
Ms. Mildred: Oh! [spits shoe out]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both exclaim] [cars vroom, scratching their behind] Huh? [embarrassed shock]
SpongeBob: Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...
Patrick: [giggles, thinking about the free lunch] [SpongeBob blows the thought away] [exclaims]
SpongeBob: Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!
Patrick: Okay. [grunts "focusing"]
SpongeBob: Ah, that's perfect. [grunts] [laughs] [grunts again]
Patrick: [giggles] [starts grunting]
Both: Hmm? [screams]
Snail: [meows after being stuck on the bag]
Old Man Jenkins: [mumbles] I can walk! [turns around] Oh!
'Kids: [laughs] [Ryan screams, along with SpongeBob and Patrick] [bag comes back to get the other two] Oh!
Old Man Jenkins: [exclaims briefly]
Babies: [laughter]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): Babies?!
SpongeBob: [grunts] [motor revs]
Both: [screams] [tires screech]
Babies: [babbles]
Bag: [thuds on SpongeBob and Patrick]
Random People: [scream]
Patrick: [grunts] SpongeBob? Where are you?
SpongeBob: [grunts] I'm down here. [giggles]
Patrick: [giggles] Shall we, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: We shall, Patrick
Both: [both hum]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Babies? No! [screams]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Whoa! [both grunt]
SpongeBob: Hmm...Hm? [turns paper around] Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
Patrick: Hooray! Now, where's that free lunch? [slurps] [thinks again about it]
SpongeBob: [groans] [slaps Patrick] Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
Patrick: Hmm, hmm.
Both: [both hum]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery. [shocked] Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
Both: [both grunt] [bag thuds]
Patrick: [goes through the back door to pull it] [becomes muscular] [destroys the house] And that's how you do it.
SpongeBob: [frightened] Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
Fruit man: This wasn't Bubble Bass's grandmother's house. That is! [points to Bubble Bass's grandmother's house] This was my house!
SpongeBob: Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
Both: Whew.
Fruit man: [blows up and hat flies down]
Both: [both grunt]
SpongeBob: [looks down] Don't look down, Patrick!
Patrick: [zips eyes] I turned off my eyes. [wind gusting]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! [hiccups] Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—  [hiccups again] Hiccups.
Patrick: Hiccups? I want some. I'm so hungry!
SpongeBob: [hiccups again, exclaims] Here comes another one, Patrick.
Patrick: [blocks SpongeBob's hiccup, grunting]
SpongeBob: Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
Patrick: Yeah—  [hiccups saying "Hiccup!"]
Both: [bridge collapses, both grunt]
SpongeBob: Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up!
Both: [both scream]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up! [x2]
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: [hits Patrick in the head with a shoe]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both scream] Oof, ta-da, Oof.
Bubble Bass: I hope you didn't damage my goods.
SpongeBob: Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
Patrick: [gulps out a bib and fork and knife]
Bubble Bass: Oh, yes, about that. I'm afraid I was waiting for you so long that I ate them! [eats the paper bags] Mmm. [belches]
SpongeBob: [whimpers]
Patrick: [inhales and swallows the fork, knife, and bib. grumbles] If my friend SpongeBob doesn't get his free lunch, [a realistic close-up of Patrick's face] things are gonna get crazy! [pants while Bubble Bass melts]
SpongeBob: That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
Patrick: I would.
SpongeBob: Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
Bubble Bass: [watches the pair leave and laughs] Well, you pulled it off, Bubble Bass. And you didn't even have to flick a fin. [hums and opens a box]
Mama Bass: [emerges from a box and growls] Bubble Bass, why do you think it's funny to pack your mother in a box and drag her all over town?!
Bubble Bass: [Shocked] Mother?! [grunts as she picks him up and stuffs him in two boxes]
Mama Bass: [Pulls a dolly out her hair] We'll just see how you like it! [pants as she pushes him]
Bubble Bass: I didn't do it! [Mama bass bumps into a mailbox] Ow! [bumps him into a building] Mother, please—  [grunts] It was SpongeBob and Patrick! [grunts] I'll dry the dishes, Mommy. [grunts] I love you, Mommy.
