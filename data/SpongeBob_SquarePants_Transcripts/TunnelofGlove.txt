[Pans in on Glove World!]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Pearl, come on! The line for the Tunnel of Glove is filling up! This is going to be so, totally like, fun!
[Pearl, Debbie, and Nancy walk into SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, Pearl!
Pearl: Barnacles, SpongeBob, why are you talking to me?
Nancy: Is that your boyfriend?
SpongeBob: Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend. [Laughs]
Nancy and Debbie: [Laughs]
Nancy: SpongeBob! Stand here for a second! [Moves SpongeBob next to Pearl]
[Camera Flash and Sound Effect]
Nancy: [Giggles]
Debbie: [Holds Camera] Just thought we should keep this moment for... posterity. [Shows Nancy]
Nancy and Debbie: [Giggle] Pearl's got a boyfriend! Pearl's got a boyfriend! Pearl's got a boyfriend!
Patrick: [To SpongeBob] I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Pearl: Quiet! He is not my boyfriend!
Patrick: That was fast. [To SpongeBob] Don't worry, buddy, there's plenty of fish in the street car.
Nancy: Anyway, let's go to the ride!
SpongeBob: Bye, Pearl! Tell Mr. Krabs I said "Hi," Let's bounce Patrick. Patrick?
Patrick: [Eating Cotton Candy at a Stand] Busy, I'll catch up with you later.
[Goes to the "Tunnel of Glove"]
Man: [Opens Metal Gate to the Ride Boats] Next!
Nancy: [Walks through with Debby] Come on, Pearl!
Man: [Holds Hand Out] Sorry, only two per car. You'll have to wait for the next car. [To The Line] Any single riders come to the front!
SpongeBob: Oh! I'm a single rider! [Walks through Line] Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me!
SpongeBob: [Holds hands out to direct Pearl into the Car] After you, fellow single rider Pearl.
Pearl: [Groans]
[Bubble Transition to Boat Riding]
Intercom System: Please keep your arms and legs inside at all times. And do not leave the boat until the ride, is over. Thank you!
SpongeBob: Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat.
Pearl: Ugh, I will put my arm in the boat. But don't touch me, don't talk to me, don't even look at me!
SpongeBob: [Zippers Mouth and Eyes Shut]
[Boat enters the tunnel. After about 6 seconds, Pearl begins to get bored]
Pearl: BORING!
[Camera turns to a metal person]
Metal Angel: Will my arrow find her heart?
Pearl: Ugh, this ride is lame! Hey! You're allowed to speak now!
SpongeBob: [Unzippers eyes and mouth] [Quickly] I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard? [Mouth becomes microphone] Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Narrator: Two very boring minutes later...
SpongeBob: And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!
[Pearl gets very annoyed and even more bored]
Pearl: [screams] You are making this ride even more boring! Is such a thing is possible!
[Pearl begins to climb out of the boat, but SpongeBob tries to stop her]
SpongeBob: You're supposed to remain seated until the ride's come to a COMPLEEETE- [SpongeBob is launched up onto the ceiling and knocks over a few hearts. One lands in the water. SpongeBob lands next to a stunned Pearl] Stop! [one of the hearts lands in one of the ride's controls, jamming it. Then, the ride stops]
Pearl: What was that?!
Voice over Microphone: Attention sweethearts! We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain seated.
[Pearl then becomes frustrated]
Pearl: Oh, great! Just great!
Narrator: Three hours later...
[Scene changes to policemen, thousands of people, and a helicopter surrounding the ride as if someone was being held hostage]
Perch Perkins: Breaking News! The Tunnel of Glove has turned into a Tunnel of Terror! Just hours ago, the mechanism that controls the boats mysteriously stopped, trapping the doomed couple inside. We have the youth's friends here, who escaped the tunnel before tragedy befell the two sweethearts.
Nancy: [Crying] It's true! We barely escaped with our lives! It was horrible!
Perch Perkins: And what was the name of your friends?
Nancy: [Still crying] Pearl, and her boyfriend SpongeBob! [Both walk away giggling]
Perch Perkins: So there you have it. As time quickly runs out [Scene zooms out to a big screen with Patrick sitting next to it eating a whole bunch of junk food] still no word from the imperiled whale girl and SpongeBob.
Patrick: [Startled] Oh, no! I'm out of coral on a stick! [Throws stick away] Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!
Perch Perkins: [Starts talking as Patrick continues to eat] At this time survival looks bleek, for the little yellow sponge.
Patrick: Nooooooo! This is my worst nightmare! I don't have a drink!
Perch Perkins: Hey, doofus!
Patrick: Huh?
Perch Perkins: Your best buddy is trapped in the tunnel of glove and he may never escape!
Patrick: You mean SpongeBob?
[Scene changes to Patrick running towards the entrance to the tunnel]
Patrick: I'm coming, SpongeBob!
Policeman: Hold it! No one beyond this point!
Patrick: [Mad] My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!
Policeman: No can do, big guy. Too dangerous.
Patrick: Fine! [Walks away] Well, mister police guy won't let me in the front, huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!
[Scene changes to the Glove World Power Plant with Patrick at the front door]
Patrick: Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be? [Notices door sign] Aha! [Reads dumbly when it says Danger! Keep Out! High voltage area] Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend! [Now excited] Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you, buddy! [Runs away, then comes back using his head as a battering ram. Once inside, he then looks around] SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh, there you are! [Camera zooms in on a control that looks like SpongeBob. Patrick runs to it and grabs it] Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles! [He then pulls it off, and bursts through the left wall] You're okay now, buddy! Go to your happy place! [Back inside, sparks begin to fly, and then the wires explode, causing the lights in the tunnel to turn off. SpongeBob screams in fear, a police officer hears them and pulls out a microphone].
Police Officer: Don't worry, little girl! We're working as fast as we can!
Pearl: That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!
Policeman: Thank you, little boy!
SpongeBob: It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for [scared]. Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS.
Pearl: Well, whatever, SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out! [Gets out of the boat]
SpongeBob: Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.
Pearl: Fine. After you. [Puts her arm in front]
SpongeBob: Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way...[screams] Snakes!
Pearl: Those are streamers, fool!
SpongeBob: [Climbs on top of Pearl] Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.
Pearl: Oh, grow up, SpongeBob! [slides SpongeBob off her head and SpongeBob falls] There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!
SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and...
Pearl: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: ...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES! [Scared, obviously]
Pearl: [Scared] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [looks like a pirate] Or ghostly pirates!  [Pearl starts being scared, SpongeBob looks like a Frankenstein Monster] Or laboratory creatures!
Pearl: [Gasps] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [looks like an alien] Or green beings from another planet!
Pearl: Okay, SpongeBob. Okay.
SpongeBob: [looks like an unshaven person with a full head of black hair] Or bus drivers!
Pearl: Ah, that's enough! [Cries]
SpongeBob: Shhh. Did you hear that?
Pearl: Now I'm scared, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It sounded like a crawly were-clown.
Pearl: But there's no such thing!
SpongeBob: Oh, he's here.
[A Cupid Swings by]
SpongeBob and Pearl: [They scream and jump into the boat and SpongeBob gets hit in the head by a toilet plunger]
SpongeBob: A ha ha ha, he.
[Scene skips to Patrick and Metal SpongeBob]
Patrick: Not another skunk! How did you beat me again? [Turns to an electrician] Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey, I am talking towards you.
Electrician: Did you see the dimwit who ripped this apart?
Patrick: I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I do know that you've kidnapped SpongeBob.
Electrician: I don't know about your best friend. I'm just the electrician.
Patrick: Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.
Electrician: You need to relax. Have a seat and cool off.
Patrick: Geez. Some people are so pushy. [Sits on the lever]
Electrician: Just don't sit on THE LEVER!
Patrick: Oops. [Breaks the lever]
Electrician: Now the whole ride is stuck on "Dangerous Super Fast Mode"!
Patrick: You told me to sit on it.
[Scene skips to the inside of the Tunnel of Glove]
SpongeBob: What was that?
Pearl: I don't know. Hold me, SpongeBob
Both: [scream] Huh!
SpongeBob: Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!
[Scene skips to the Glove World Power plant]
Patrick: Okay, okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall. [Leans on a do not push button, which reads "Animatronic Override"]
Electrician: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
[Scene skips to the inside of the tunnel]
SpongeBob: Wow! How romantical.
Pearl: Pssssst. I imagined it bigger. [robot Anthony's head explodes]
SpongeBob: Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub. [The cherub's head explodes, then the cherub shoots its pin] Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil! [the rest of the Robot heads explode and walk towards SpongeBob and Pearl, they both shiver in fear]
[Scene skips to the Glove World Power Plant]
Electrician: [grunts] Stupid kid.
Patrick: [walks out of the water pressure control system with toilet paper and a newspaper in his hand] Nice facilities. Great water pressure. [The toilet paper flies back]
Electrician: Neptune's mother! [realizing that there is extreme water pressure]
[Scene skips to the inside of the Tunnel of Glove]
SpongeBob and Pearl: [Frightened]
SpongeBob: What's that? [A waterfall comes toward them, they get washed away]
Both: [Screaming more]
Evil Fish #1: [pops out, scaring both as they race down a waterfall]
SpongeBob and Pearl:  [both scream again as the boat goes down a waterfall, they both scream as the boat goes down a whirlpool]
Evil Fish #2, 3 and 4: Uhhhhhh!
[Scene skips to outside the Tunnel of Glove]
Police Man: She's gonna blow! Noooooo! [fish run away from the tunnel]
Other Fish: [everyone screams as the Tunnel of Glove bursts and the boat SpongeBob and Pearl were in breaks]
Pearl: I guess that turned out to be pretty fun.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Nancy and Debbie: [Laughing at SpongeBob and Pearl]
Nancy: SpongeBob is your boyfriend.
Pearl: [Knocks SpongeBob out of the seat] How many times to I have to say it? Eww! Gross!
Nancy: Oh, don't deny it. You were totally hugging him, and everyone knows that totally means he's totally your boyfriend.
Crawly Clown: [Laughs] Howdy, kids!
SpongeBob: [screams] Crawly clown! Crawly clown!
SpongeBob and Nancy and Debbie: [screaming horrified]
Pearl: [Takes a picture] You understand, girls. For posterity! [Laughs]
[Scene skips to Patrick and Metal SpongeBob]
Patrick: Are you gonna finish that?
