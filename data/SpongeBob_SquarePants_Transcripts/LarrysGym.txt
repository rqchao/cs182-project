[The episode opens with the crowd attending the grand opening of Larry's Gym.]
Larry: What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!
[The crowd is cheering again. Larry pulls out some scissors and cuts the ribbon. Then he throws the scissors away.]
Larry: Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.
[The crowd appear in flappy looks.]
Crowd: Awwww!
Larry: Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!
[The crowd cheers for the third time.]
Larry: For the price of a lifetime membership!
[Larry points to the lifetime membership booth.]
Crowd: Awww! [looks down]
Larry: But today everything is free!
[The crowd cheers and runs into gym.]
Larry's #1 Fan: Shape us and mold us in your image!
Frankie Billy: [appears with scissors through his head] You're the lobster, Larry! The Alpha Lobster!
Larry: Well, I don't know if I'll say that! [buffs up]
Lloyd-Rich: Oh, I filled out a membership form! [hands form to Larry]
Nat Peterson: Me too! [hands form to Larry]
Larry: What's in that pink box?
Nat Peterson: Um, donuts sir?
[Larry throws away the box of donuts.]
Larry: Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!
[Mr. Krabs magically appears out of nowhere.]
Mr. Krabs: Is it true that everything is free?
Larry: That's right, sir! For your first visit we-
[Mr. Krabs runs off and disappears.]
Larry: Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory! [buffs up once more]  
[SpongeBob is struggling to open the doors.]
Larry: Boy, I've got my work cut out for me.
[SpongeBob gets his hands stuck inside of the doors.]
Larry: The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob jumps up and down trying to activate the automatic door.]
Larry: [grunts] Here!
[Larry steps on the mat and opens the door.]
SpongeBob: Aah! Thanks, Larry!
[Larry sighs and notices Mr. Krabs carrying an exercise bicycle on his back as he leaves the gym.]
Larry: Uh, what are you doing?
Mr. Krabs: You said everything was free.
Larry: [laughs] No, no. Your first visit is free.
Mr. Krabs: So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
[Mr. Krabs walks back inside with the exercise bicycle.]
Larry: [laughs] Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.
[Close-up of paperwork.]
Larry: [while reading some of the paperwork] I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
[Larry drops his head down on the desk in disgust.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?
[SpongeBob's legs are all cramped up. Larry freaks out.]
Larry: Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule. [pulls out water bottle] Always be hydrating.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the water bottle. As SpongeBob drinks it, his legs become straight again.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?
Larry: Sure! [picks up SpongeBob] What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claw.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squishy.
Larry: [sighs] What I'm saying is I can make you a man.
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Larry: I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership. [holds up membership papers]
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
[Larry drops the membership papers on SpongeBob's hands and drops a pencil next to him. SpongeBob struggles to lift a pencil.]
Larry: That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!
[SpongeBob signs the papers at a fast pace and becomes very tired.]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
[SpongeBob drinks more water.]
Larry: And remember: always be hydrating!
SpongeBob: Ok, I will!
[SpongeBob drinks more water at a fast pace.]
Larry: That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later.
SpongeBob: Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers. [walks with Larry to the exercise room] Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, "Beautiful Angel". That's normal, right?
Frank (muscular goldfish): It's Larry, King of the Gym!
[The crowd cheers.]
Larry: Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!
[Frankie Billy shows up holding towels. Larry pulls out a shining crown.]
Larry: Polish this crown for me. Will you?
[Larry give Frankie Billy his crown and Frankie Billy walks off.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these... [tries to lift weights with a barbell] really heavy... pieces of metal for free!
[The heavy weight of the barbell snaps Mr. Krabs' arms and it falls on his chest.]
Mr. Krabs: Ow! Free!
[Mr. Krabs' shell breaks into pieces, revealing his pink skin and leaving Mr. Krabs dazed.]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.
French Narrator: Flashback...
[The flashback shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of snail food while feeding Gary, which ends up pulling his arms off. Then it shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of groceries that was given from an old lady, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. Then it showed SpongeBob trying to lift his pillow while going to bed, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. And finally, it showed SpongeBob, after warming himself up, trying to lift the pile of arms he lost, which also resulted in pulling his arms off.]
French Narrator: End of flashback...
Larry: Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
[Larry looks through his cabinet and picks up a box of cotton swabs.]
Larry: Here we go. Cotton swabs. [takes a cotton swab stick] Cotton balls. [sticks two cotton balls on each end] Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the cotton swab with the cotton balls on it. SpongeBob tries to lift it but ends up pulling his arms off.]
SpongeBob: How am I doing?
Larry: Pathetic.
SpongeBob: [talks with a jug of water in mouth] Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!
[SpongeBob drinks the water from the jug.]
Larry: Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.
[SpongeBob regrows his arms and follows Larry as he drinks the water. Larry and SpongeBob enter another exercise room.]
Larry: First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.
SpongeBob: I'll be there!
Larry: That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
[SpongeBob is seen munching on some kelpo cereal. Larry pulls the cereal box away.]
Larry: The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle! [stuffs a water bottle in SpongeBob's mouth] Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches! [does sit-ups] Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!
SpongeBob: Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh. [laughs when bending over] Only now, I'll do it on my back.
[SpongeBob flips and lands on his back. Then he does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: Could you do it without the laugh?
SpongeBob: I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not. [laughs]
Larry: Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
SpongeBob: Always be hydrating.
[SpongeBob sticks a jug of water on his head and does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: [sighs] Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs rubbing a towel on himself at the front desk while Larry is working on the paperwork.]
Mr. Krabs: Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Larry: Do you have to do that in front of me?
Mr. Krabs: Yes! Yes I do! [throws the towel in Larry's face] Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he walks away. Larry gets off his desk and attempts to pick up the towels Mr. Krabs threw. But as he bends over, he back cracks and his belly pops out, freaking out a passing customer.]
Mr. Krabs: Nice potbelly!
Larry: Potbelly? [pokes his belly]
[Larry hears SpongeBob laughing.]
Larry: Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.
[Larry enters the gym and a shadow creeps down on him.]
Larry: [gasps] Oh my Neptune!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where the hungry customers are complaining about not getting their food. In the kitchen, SpongeBob attempts to do his job as a fry cook. But due to his newly massive strength and buffed up body, everything he touches ends up getting crushed and stepped on.]
SpongeBob: Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
[SpongeBob goes to lift the patties, but ends up lifting the stove. The stove flies out of the restaurant and lands on Frankie Billy who is driving his boat.]
Frankie Billy: My legs! [boat explodes] I'm ok! [the stove lands on him] Slightly less ok!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob walks through the wall.]
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!
[SpongeBob's muscle punches Squidward's face. The muscles on his belly become six sponges popping up and down. The muscle on his right leg turns into a solid gold block. SpongeBob's nose reflexes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
[SpongeBob runs off to Larry's gym as Squidward's face pops back out. The scene changes to people coming in and out of the gym. Larry, who is now extremely obese, is still at his desk working on his paperwork.]
SpongeBob: Larry?
[Larry stands up and all of the papers fly around.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.
Larry: With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!
Larry: SpongeBob, tell me the truth. [shows SpongeBob his belly] Do I have a potbelly?
[SpongeBob freaks out a bit.]
SpongeBob: No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.
[SpongeBob is almost about to laugh but keeps his cool.]
Larry: [sighs] See you in exercise class. I guess.
[SpongeBob goes to the exercise room and Larry begins to cry in agony. As he cries, his tears fall into the opening of his round belly. Mr. Krabs shows up with a spoon.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh boy! Free soup! [tastes a sample of Larry's tears] Little heavy on the salt.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and everyone in the exercise room getting ready for class.]
SpongeBob: Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.
[The crowd murmurs in amazement.]
SpongeBob: I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back. [does sit-ups as he laughs]
[The crowd does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: [lays on his back and moves his legs in the air] Walk on your back.
[The crowd also does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
[SpongeBob pours water on his head with a water bottle and the crowd did the same thing.]
SpongeBob: I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.
[SpongeBob lays on his back and pretends to ride a bicycle. The crowd does the same thing. Through the window of the exercise room, a depressed Larry is watching from the outside. He thinks that SpongeBob is a well better instructor than he is and sadly walks by the steam room. Mr. Krabs pops out of the steam room.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
[Mr. Krabs pops back in the steam room. Larry sighs in depression and heads back to his desk. He drinks some coffee. He takes a pencil and attempts to break it. But due to is decreased muscle strength, he couldn't break it. He then tries to lift weights with another pencil but with donuts on each end. However, he couldn't do it because of his loss in muscle strength.]
Larry: Oh, what's the use.
[Larry eats a donut and drops his face flat on his desk.]
Larry: Oh, who am I kidding!
[SpongeBob arrives on an exercise bike.]
SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?
Larry: Yeah. [eats other donut] Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.
SpongeBob: I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...
Larry: I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob. [puts the crown on SpongeBob's head] You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.
SpongeBob: This sounds great.
[Larry begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!
Larry: Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
[The crown falls off of SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: You mean a br-ug?
Larry: I don't wanna call it that.
SpongeBob: Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!
[SpongeBob and Larry hug each other and cried in despair. But they hug and cry, water spews out of SpongeBob and he shrinks back to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, what happened?
Larry: Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!
SpongeBob: Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!
Larry: Don't say br-ug.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Br-ug. [laughs]
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claws and SpongeBob does his sit-ups while laughing. Larry does the same exact thing and in the process, his muscles begin to build up and his strength returns to normal.]
Larry: SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed! [buffs up] You're a pretty good instructor after all. [sits down] Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.
[SpongeBob continues to laugh as he does his sit-ups.]
French Narrator: The very next evening...
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob is happily flipping the patties on the grill.]
Squidward: Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob places his two spatulas in his pockets.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what a great day.
Squidward: And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
[The scene changes to Larry's gym getting ready to close up for the night. Larry is walking by the steam room until he sees steam coming out.]
Larry: Huh? [sniffs] What is that smell? [jiggles the doorknob] Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!
[Larry pulls the door off and sees Mr. Krabs as a cooked up crab on a plate with melted butter and lemons on the side, meaning that he had been in the steam room too long.]
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
[The episode ends.]
