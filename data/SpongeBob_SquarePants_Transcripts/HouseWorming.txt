[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house during the night. As SpongeBob and Gary are asleep, a worm appears at the window. The worm ties himself with a rope and shoots an arrow at SpongeBob's diving board. He dangles over SpongeBob and looks down at his holes. He cuts the rope with his teeth and parachutes into SpongeBob's hole, which immediately wakes SpongeBob up.]
SpongeBob: Hi. [looks up] Gary, I feel funny inside.
[Gary is still sleeping. SpongeBob digs his finger into one of his holes. The worm bites his finger.]
SpongeBob: Yow!
[SpongeBob looks inside his body and sees the worm.]
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The worm shivers.]
SpongeBob: Gary, there's something inside of me.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow.
SpongeBob: You see anything?
[Gary peeks inside SpongeBob's hole and sees the worm. He screeches and his eyestalks fly around inside SpongeBob's body. He catches the worm and struggles to pull him out. SpongeBob pulls Gary's eyestalks out of his body.]
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?
[The worm pops out.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello.
[The worm goes back in SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you Prickles!
[Prickles hides in SpongeBob's body and pops out in another hole.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I see you!
[Prickles continuously goes in and out of SpongeBob's holes.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a pet—Gary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one.
[SpongeBob tries to blow Prickles out of his body, but it doesn't work. He does it numerous times, but Prickles still wants to stay inside SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs out of breath and Prickles begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't want to hear the little guy cry.
Gary: Meow.
[Prickles pops out and babbles his story to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] Such a sad story.
[Prickles babbles about staying for one night.]
SpongeBob: Okay, little buddy, but just for one night.
[Prickles kisses SpongeBob and goes back inside. SpongeBob gives Prickles a blanket.]
SpongeBob: Nighty-night, Prickles.
[SpongeBob and Gary go back to sleep. But as they sleep, Prickles wakes up and signals an airplane inside SpongeBob's house. The airplane drops off more worms and the worms parachute inside SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[SpongeBob wakes up and sees Prickles and his worm friends disco dancing inside his body. Two worms are flashing lights with the music, the other two worms are blowing through their noisemakers, another is juggling fire clubs, and a clown worm is riding through the holes on a bicycle. As they continue to party, SpongeBob bounces along with the music.]
SpongeBob: Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited? [laughs] I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends! [shows Gary the worms]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
French Narrator: 3,000 Wup-poos later...
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! [babbling and humming]
[Gary slithers to the window and pulls the shades up. It is morning outside.]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.
[But the worms are too distracted by the music and continue to dance.]
SpongeBob: Guys? Guy—guys?
[Gary growls at the worms and pushes SpongeBob with his eyestalks.]
SpongeBob: Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.
[One worm blows a raspberry at Gary. Gary has had enough with the worms and pushes SpongeBob out of his house.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [gasps and pulls his underwear up] Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!
[Gary throws out a pair of pants.]
SpongeBob: Gary, I need to take a shower.
[Gary throws out a stick of "Stinky Pits" deodorant. SpongeBob rubs his armpits with the deodorant. Nearby, a mother and a child are watching what SpongeBob is doing.]
Debbie Rechid: I did not need to see that! Ugh!
[The mom jumps into the baby carriage and drives off. SpongeBob throws away the deodorant stick and puts his pants on.]
SpongeBob: All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the— [gasps as he sees the worms in SpongeBob's body] Sweet Dutchman's ghost! [rubs his finger against SpongeBob's body] When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
SpongeBob: I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir.
[SpongeBob inhales his worms into his body, but he runs out of breath and the worms fly out.]
Mr. Krabs: If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
[SpongeBob's hands are covered with worms.]
SpongeBob: I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second? [whispering] Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.
[Prickles goes inside SpongeBob's head and types out on a piece of paper.]
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Squatters rights?" What the heck is squatters rights?
Mr. Krabs: [takes paper and reads it] Oh, they're "lawyering" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.
SpongeBob: It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.
Mr. Krabs: Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy "condisherin'."
[Prickles pops out and dumps garbage on the patties.]
Mr. Krabs: [irritated] Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid—
Squidward: On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the restaurant with a broom. But as he pushes him out, the broom is now a really long pole made of a wooden plank, a tree trunk, a stop sign where Old Man Walker is tied up, and a flagpole where the flag is an inverted flag of Ukraine.]
Mr. Krabs: And don't come back until you're dewormed!
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
[SpongeBob tries to push some worms out of his body as Plankton walks by.]
Plankton: Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I lost my job over it.
Plankton: Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
SpongeBob: Anything, Plankton! Anything!
[Plankton puts on rubber gloves and grabs a tank of toxic gas for pests.]
Plankton: [chuckles] Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
[SpongeBob picks Plankton up so he can enter his body and exterminate the worms.]
Plankton: Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
[Plankton roars as he attempts to get rid of the worms. But the worms attack Plankton from left to right inside SpongeBob's body until they push him out. Plankton is now injured from his fight with the worms.]
Plankton: [groans] You're on your own, worm boy.
[SpongeBob is overwhelmed at his condition as the worms continue to party inside.]
French Narrator: Soon after...
[SpongeBob continues to fight off the worms as he runs over to Patrick's house. He knocks on the rock as the worms continue partying in his body. Patrick opens up.]
Patrick: Hello?
SpongeBob: You gotta help me!
[The worms cover around SpongeBob's eyes and mouth to make a scary face.]
Patrick: Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—
[Patrick shuts his rock.]
SpongeBob: Aw! Hmm?
[SpongeBob sees Squidward entering his house and attempts to walk over to him.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [his eyes and mouth are covered with worms] I need a hug!
[Squidward screams, takes out a hose, and sprays SpongeBob with water. SpongeBob's body becomes filled with water. A worm swims inside SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Does that mean no hug?
Squidward: There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
[The worms jump out of SpongeBob and swim over to attack Squidward. Squidward screams and runs into his house. The worms go back inside SpongeBob as he sulks his way to his house, which is boarded up by Gary. Gary growls as SpongeBob walks until he stops. He turns around and his body has become an apartment. One of the worms is seen hanging her laundry on her clothesline. SpongeBob opens his body and sees various worms doing their daily activities. One elderly worm is watching television, two worms are hanging out at a jacuzzi, another worm is rap dancing, and one cranky worm is knocking on the ceiling with a broomstick. SpongeBob closes his body as he has completely lost his sanity.]
SpongeBob: Well, this is my life from now on, huh? [laughs] Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms! [laughing]
[As SpongeBob loses his sanity while laughing uncontrollably, the worms become annoyed by his constant laughter as he is shaking his body. The worms have had enough with his laughter and decide to leave his body once and for all. They gather up all of their stuff, load up their mini van, and exit SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one. [laughs as Gary slithers up to him]
Gary: [sniffs] Meow!
[SpongeBob hugs Gary.]
SpongeBob: Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!
[SpongeBob carries Gary into his house. The worms that left SpongeBob's body enter Squidward's house and begin partying inside.]
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! I need a hug! [The short "Clam Up!" plays]
[The short opens with Prickles getting out of his house, which is a can of beans, one morning with sunglasses on. He walks to a mousetrap, opens it, and sits on it. He puts a sun reflector on him and drinks some lemonade. A shade comes upon him, and when he slightly takes off his sunglasses, he sees a giant clam on top of a piece of coral, squawking. He yells at it, but the clam continues squawking. He moves the mousetrap away from the shade, and gets tired after pushing it. He goes back on it and gets his sun reflector again, but the clam squawks even more louder than before. He takes off his sunglasses and throws a boot at it, then puts his sunglasses back on to relax some more. The clam goes beside him and squawks loudly at him, shocking Prickles and causing him to get trapped inside the mousetrap, which also makes the clam laugh]
[Prickles then cooks his beans on a pipe. The clam comes back and sniffs the smell coming from the beans. As he's cooking, the clam spits on him and eats the beans. He kisses Prickles, and when it leaves, Prickles rips off his clothing and yells for awhile, as two Bikini Bottomites walk by. He eventually gets tired of yelling and falls down]
[Prickles places a couple of beans in a line. The clam, who is flying around, sees the beans and eats them all, leading to the can of beans which the worm traps the clam in. He turns the can around, puts a stamp on it, and throws it into a mailfish's package as he was walking by. He waves goodbye and goes back to his house, only to realize he sent his house away and slaps his nose]
[At night, Prickles is walking with a hobo stick, scared of the surroundings. He gets shocked when he sees the mailfish severely beaten up. He also sees that the can of beans has been opened, and the clam appears behind him. He gets extremely scared, and the clam attempts to eat him after roaring at him. He hides behind a piece of coral as the clam is looking for him, and when the coast is clear, he comes out. He sees SpongeBob's house, and goes in there through the window.]
