[The episode begins with a montage of a brand new location, Bubbletown, a local city that is made entirely out of bubbles.]
Narrator: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the most fascinating place on Earth, Bubbletown! A bouncing, vibrant city, where everyone...[four bubble ducks quack] and everything is comprised entirely of globules of air!
[A bubble family forge into one big bubble. The bubble then pops into a million bubbles. SpongeBob, who is visiting Bubbletown, is fascinated at the scenery.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [brings it around town] A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!
Narrator: Let's take a closer look at this effervescent city! Some bubbletowners drive to work in their bubble cars. While others simply float. Having a bubble car is great because parking is a cinch! [a bubble person pops his bubble car] Bubbletown also provides excellent public transportation. Seats are always available because these high-tech buses can account for any number of passengers. [a bubble bus lets out several bubble people] Here are some workers going to work in their bubble building.
[The bubble workers enter their building through the bubble wall. SpongeBob attempts to do the same, but his body is too solid.]
Narrator: [laughs] You may wanna use the door. [shows a montage of bubble workers working on their bubble computers] This office uses stand-up desks, and the ceiling for a more efficient work environment.
[SpongeBob is standing upside-down on the bubble ceiling. He falls down onto the bubble floor.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa-whoa. [gets engulfed in a bubble] Wow! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Bubbletown Park where a band is playing.]
Narrator: Yes, there's all kinds of things to see and do in Bubbletown! You can enjoy Bubbletown's very own band!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! [scatting and dancing until his stomach begins to growl]
Narrator: And if you're hungry, why not try a bubble dog from one of our many bubble food vendors?
SpongeBob: One, please?
Bubble hot dog vendor: [gives SpongeBob a bubble hot dog] Here you are.
SpongeBob: Mmm! [eats the bubble hot dog and suds foam out; burps loudly] Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs! [laughs] Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gee, it's good to see ya! [hugs Bubble Buddy really tight]
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [groans as SpongeBob accidentally splits his body in half]
SpongeBob: Uh, oops. Sorry.
Bubble Buddy: Oh, don't worry about it.
SpongeBob: So, how you been? How are things?
Bubble Buddy: Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter. [shows his motor scooter's front flat tire]
SpongeBob: Let me see if I can fix that for you.
[SpongeBob takes his shoe off, pulls out a bubble wand, dips it in a bottle of soap, and blows the motor scooter into a motorcycle.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
Bubble Buddy: All right!
Bubble Man #1: Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.
Bubble Buddy: Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!
Bubble Man #1: You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof. [shows his roofless bubble house as a bubble raincloud rains down]
Bubble Wife: Honey! [screams]
SpongeBob: I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...[sighs and faints]
Bubble Buddy: And...clear! [zaps him with the bubble defibrillator]
SpongeBob: Count me in!
Bubble Man #1: Fantastic!
Bubble Man #2: Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!
[SpongeBob is writing a list down on his clipboard.]
Bubble Lady #1: I need some pajamas.
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Okay, mm, uh-huh.
Bubble Man #3: I want another sandwich!
[SpongeBob writes it down.]
Bubble Man #4: Monster truck tires!
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, wearing bubble spurs and a bubble cowboy hat, makes a western cowboy stance as he looks upon Bubbletown. The bubble straw he was chewing on pops in his face. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand and bottle of soap. He dips the wand in the soap, blows a really big bubble, and creates a brand new house for one bubble person.]
Bubble Man #1: Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob blows some bubbles and forms giant monster truck tires for one bubble person's bubble car.]
Bubble Man #4: All right! [drives his bubble monster truck away]
[SpongeBob blows some more bubbles. The bubbles hit an disgruntled old bubble man with a sore back and forms a scooter for him to ride on. The old bubble man was so happy that he begins riding in his new scooter. SpongeBob then dances around in a happy dance and forms bubble flowers all over the place.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown! [laughs and bounces uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: Watch out for those—
[SpongeBob crashes into something off-screen.]
Bubble Lady #2: Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.
[SpongeBob looks down and sees two bubble dogs in his feet.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—
[SpongeBob attempts to remove his feet out from the bubble dogs, but he slips and pops them underneath him. The dogs are now reduced to a puddle and the bubble lady gasps in horror.]
SpongeBob: Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [slips on the suds and lands on the bubble lady, which resulted it getting soap in his eyes] Whoa! [wails in pain] My eyes! [screams as he slips uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob, come back!
Bubble Groom: Amy, will you marry me? [holds out a bubble ring]
Amy: Yes! I will!
[SpongeBob slips into Amy and accidentally pops her.]
Bubble Groom: Aw. [begins to sulk, but SpongeBob slips into him and accidentally pops him]
[The bubble ring pops in mid-air. SpongeBob skids out of control and accidentally pops a line of bubble ducklings and a bubble duck. He then pops some of the bubble buildings in Bubbletown. The scene changes to the bubble mayor giving a grand opening to a new bubble elementary school for bubble children.]
Bubble mayor: I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.
[The bubble crowd cheers.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!
[SpongeBob screams as he continue to slip on the suds. Just as the bubble mayor was about to cut the bubble ribbon, SpongeBob slips past him and pops it.]
Bubble mayor: Hey! That was my job! [gets accidentally popped by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
[SpongeBob accidentally pops the little bubble boy with his shoe, causing the bubble crowd to gasp.]
SpongeBob: [slow-motion] Watch out! [accidentally pops the bubble crowd and the new bubble elementary school]
[SpongeBob continues to skid out of control.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob slips into the Bubbletown's bubble sign, bumps into a rock and lands near the shore. He lays flat on his face and cries.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.
SpongeBob: [gets up] No! Stay away! [shows his face covered in sand, shells, and sticks] I'm a monster! [whimpers] A monster! [Bubble Buddy gasps] Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
[Bubbletown is now a complete mess from the destruction SpongeBob accidentally caused.]
Bubble Fred: My bubble legs!
Bubble Man #4: [his bubble monster truck's tires pop] My monster truck tires! [his bubble monster truck pops]
Bubble Buddy: Okay, that doesn't look great. [uneasy chuckle] But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.
[A bubble police car arrives and pops, revealing a bubble police officer.]
Bubble police officer: I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.
SpongeBob: Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.
[The bubble police officer handcuffs him with bubble handcuffs. The scene changes to Bubbletown Prison. The bubble police officer gives SpongeBob the bubble telephone.]
Bubble police officer: All right, you get one phone call.
SpongeBob: Okay. [dials the number on the bubble telephone; the line thrills and a recorded voice is going] The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second. [the bubble telephone beeps; as he talks through the bubble telephone, it forms into a big bubble] Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um...[sniffs] I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry! [pushes the bubble message out the bubble window of Bubbletown Prison and cries]
French Narrator: Later…
[Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs comes out from his office and is shocked to see a long line of starving customers. Squidward is sleeping one the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: [yells loudly in Squidward's face] Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: [pulls his hat off to straighten out his face] Du, huh, what, who?
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?
[Old Man Jenkins passes out and dies. His angel begins to exit his body, but he grabs it and stuffs it back in.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm okay!
Mr. Krabs: Well…?
Squidward: What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.
Mr. Krabs: [peaks into the kitchen and looks around; talks high-pitched] What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?
[Just then, SpongeBob's bubble message floats in and an image of SpongeBob appears on it as it breaks air.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—[Mr. Krabs pops the bubble message before it finishes]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can! [runs out to go rescue SpongeBob from Bubbletown Prison]
Customers: Wha—whoa. [fall over like domino blocks]
[Back at Bubbletown Prison, SpongeBob is lifting weights with some bubble prisoners. All of a sudden, Mr. Krabs appears and pops Bubbletown Prison wall, which resulted in freeing some bubble prisoners including the Dirty Bubble.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob off] This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!
Bubble police officer: Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
Mr. Krabs: Eat claw, bubble cop!
[Mr. Krabs clamps his claws and spins around and around like a helicopter.]
Bubble police officer: Uh-huh?
[Mr. Krabs flies over towards to bubble police officer and chases him in the Bubbletown Prison. Mr. Krabs' sharp claws proceeds to pops everything into Bubbletown Prison and completely destroys it. He then destroys a bubble house's roof.]
Bubble Wife: Honey!
[Mr. Krabs spins uncontrollably and continuously pops all of Bubbletown until everything is nothing more than puddles of suds. The last thing he pops is a small bubble duckling, which he falls on top off.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here. [pulls off SpongeBob's face by accident] Uh-oh. [pastes it back on him]
SpongeBob: [falls to the ground in complete shock] You popped it all. [his eyes tear up] There's nothing left!
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.
SpongeBob: No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved. [his tears form a replica of Bubbletown on the ground as he sobs]
Bubble Buddy: [shows up with a big bottle of soap] So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, yeah!
Bubble Buddy: Yeah!
SpongeBob: [pops out a variety of bubble wands] Let's blow this popsicle stand. [laughs]
[The scene changes to newly blow Bubbletown. Bubbletown now has a new location that looks almost similar to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom. It is known as the Bubbly Krab. The bubble groom drives away with Amy, his newly wedded bubble wife. In the Bubbly Krab, SpongeBob is wearing a bubble hat similar to the hat he wears at the Krusty Krab and is holding a bubble spatula.]
Bubble Buddy: I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab. [shows all the bubble customers eating Bubble Patties]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs as he is counting bubble money in the Bubbly Krab cash register] Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o! [opens the bubble cash register and pops out bubble money] I am making money claw over fist here. [stuffs the bubble money in the bubble cash register] Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?
Bubble Buddy: There is none! [laughs along with SpongeBob]
[All the bubble customers laugh as well.]
Bubble customers: Exchange rate? [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. We're done here. [pops the Bubbly Krab, picks up SpongeBob, and leaves Bubbletown in disgust]
SpongeBob: Huh. [giggles]
[Bubble ducks walk by with a little bubble boy.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!
