SpongeBob: ♪La La La La La La La La! Getting clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Oh, what a delightful day it is to get...♪ [soap slips out of SpongeBob's hands] Noooooo! [Soap lands on the ground far away from the shower] Good thing I have a spare. [opens a new bar of soap] I still have one more thing to clean! [sticks soap through his ear and he washes his brain. His brain gets clean, and smiles. He gets out of shower and slips through his wringer] Oh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet! [laughs and gets dressed] And now I'm ready to go to work! [slips on soap, screams, and then gets up off ground] You've got to be more careful, SquarePants! [spare bar of soap falls on the floor] Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... [notices soap]... that! Oh, I saw you. Not going to fool me this time, soap. [soap frowns. Then SpongeBob steps on a rubber duckie. He jumps back onto the soap, slipping him in his wringer. He tries to escape] This is not going well.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber ducky?
SpongeBob: Oh, is that it?
Patrick: I found you! Duckie Duck! [laughs] Quack, quack, quack!
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick?
Patrick: Huh...
SpongeBob: I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here.
Patrick: What do you need, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean.
Patrick: Stuck? I can help with that. [reaches for a bottle marked "Forever Glue" and applies it to the wringer] There you go, buddy. Now you're stuck forever!
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks, Patrick! Now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?! [when the glue starts to dry SpongeBob tries to escape, but it's too late. The glue has dried, and SpongeBob is unable to get himself free] Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck, not more stuck! How am I going to get to work when I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of wringer! [SpongeBob uses his eyes, nose and teeth to get out of the wringer, but he gets pulled back and screams]
Patrick: [breaks wringer off of the ground] There, is that better?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?
Patrick: Okay, you know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion? [a flag with a Krabby Patty on it appears behind them] Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame-broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, "Hey! I can!" I'm ready!
Patrick: That's the spirit!
SpongeBob: Woo! [crashes into door and falls down the stairs] Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!
[cut to the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob uses a spatula attached to the wringer, and kicks the box of toppings to land on the patty]
SpongeBob: Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!
Squidward: It's about time. [he notices SpongeBob, who has put the bottle of mustard in one of his holes, and laughs at him] Hey, SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?! [laughs] Hardware store!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.
Squidward: Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy. [gives himself thumbs up and winks]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, pal. [he returns the thumbs up and accidentally squirts mustard into Squidward's eyes, causing him to scream in pain, and his eyes to shrivel off and fall on the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Ohh! Squidward! [Squidward falls in the cashier station] Squidward! [jumps on Squidward's stomach] Are you okay?
Squidward: Please, just get away from me.
Customer: Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?
SpongeBob: Ohh! A refill! [hits cash register, which falls on customer's foot]
Customer: Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot! [bumps into table] Ow! My back! [bumps into table] My face!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing-- [hits cash register, which opens and spews money everywhere] Whoa! [smashes into a pole] Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok- [screams after seeing customers taking the money] Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] Me money! What do you think you're doing? [he snatches money from a customer] That ain't yours. [He does it again] Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy... [SpongeBob struggles to get out of the pole, blasts out, exclaims, crashes into Mr. Krabs and the other customers]
SpongeBob: Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.
Mr. Krabs: [shouts] Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today. [shows destroyed restaurant and he takes SpongeBob outside] And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone! [throws SpongeBob out of the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how was work?
SpongeBob: Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack. [a kid chains his bike to the wringer. SpongeBob starts crying]
Patrick: Hey! Don't you go crying on me! [uses a hair dryer to dry SpongeBob's teary eyes] Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.
[cut to Super Weenie Hut Jr.'s]
SpongeBob: You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
Patrick: Dig in!
SpongeBob: [he tries to eat ice cream, but can't because his hands are stuck in the wringer, so he uses his tongue but he can't swallow it] I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!
Patrick: Bummer. Hey, you know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean. [then he eats SpongeBob's ice cream. Cut to the carnival]
Patrick: Look! The ball toss!
Ball Toss Vendor: Step right up, folks! Toss a ball, hit the cans, and win a stuffed seahorse!
Patrick: We want to play!
Ball Toss Vendor: Sure. Give me your best shot. [hands Patrick some balls]
Patrick: Thanks. [throws ball and knocks down all of the cans] Woohoo! [to SpongeBob] Now you try.
SpongeBob: [throws ball as best he can. It bounces back and hits SpongeBob in the face, and he gets a nasty black eye]
Patrick: Ohh! Oh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we got to do that!
SpongeBob: I don't know... I have too much eye pain.
Patrick: Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?! [they walk away revealing a sign that says "Carnival Always Here". Then they get into one of the seats in the ride] Ready?
SpongeBob: [struggles to reach the handle, but it's too late, the ride already starts and SpongeBob is flung out of the ride]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [flying through the air] Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!
[cut to later in the day at the carnival]
Patrick: Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too! [shows off his ribbon pin] Check it out!
SpongeBob: That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
Patrick: Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
SpongeBob: [his patience has run out] I said I don't want any! [turns and knocks it onto the ground]
Patrick: You ruined my cotton candy!
SpongeBob: Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
Ball Toss Vendor: Check it out! Public fight!
Other Vendor: Working at the carnival sure has its perks! [crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: I have never felt so ashamed.
Patrick: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!
Patrick: I was only trying to help.
SpongeBob: [shouts] Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today!
Patrick: Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore! [As Patrick runs off in tears, the crowd forms an angry mob at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.
Sandals: You know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart. [inside SpongeBob's body, his heart starts to groan sadly] You deserve what you've gotten. Come on, we're out of here. [the angry crowd leaves, listening to what Sandals says] Some people are just born mean. [SpongeBob frowns in shame]
[cut to Patrick's Rock]
Patrick: [his rock opens to reveal him brushing his teeth] Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him. [brushes his armpit, then his belly button, then puts the toothbrush back in his mouth] I can do whatever I want! [then eats the toothbrush and screams; he gets off his rock] I don't need him. [looks at SpongeBob's house and almost calls for SpongeBob to come out, but stops himself] Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge-- [stops and covers his mouth] I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest! [stares off into space, then blinks and a tumbleweed rolls by] Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
Patrick in a Thought Bubble: Maybe if SpongeBob was here, he could give you pointers.
Patrick: Who asked you?! [claps the thought bubble away] Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch! [throws stick, which lands on SpongeBob's doorstep] Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha! [pauses, puts his ear to SpongeBob's door] Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help. [walks away, but then runs back] Buddy! [throws door off hinges] Uhh! SpongeBob? [SpongeBob has stubble and is sitting in the darkened living room] SpongeBob? Hey, what are you watching?
SpongeBob: [in chair watching TV, in a trance] My favorite show. [shows static on the TV. Then the TV dies] Ha, ha, I love that part!
Patrick: SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
SpongeBob: What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
Patrick: Oh, man, he's too far gone.
SpongeBob: Not fit to live in society...
Patrick: [crying] This is all my fault! [holds up his Forever Glue] Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry! [A tear falls from his eye and runs down SpongeBob's arm, and lands on the dried glue on the wringer. The tear melts the glue and SpongeBob is able to pull his arm out]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing! [Both start crying, and all of the glue melts off. He then pulls himself out of the wringer] Look! It worked!
SpongeBob and Patrick: All right! [SpongeBob throws the wringer up in the air]
SpongeBob: [to the viewers] I guess crying does solve your problems after all. [to Patrick] Come here, buddy! [SpongeBob and Patrick hug. The wringer falls down, trapping SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
Patrick: Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?
