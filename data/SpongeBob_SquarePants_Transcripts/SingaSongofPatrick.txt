Patrick: [reading a comic book. Screams] No, no! [starts crying then stops] Yay! [laughs]
Nerd: Well, if only Inaudible Lad were here right now.
Patrick: Oh. [eats comic book] Nothing satisfies like a good story.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Patrick with a stack of comic books] Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams] Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me!
Patrick: Sponge-- [burps and a piece of paper lands into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Ew, what's this?
Patrick: [takes the piece of paper] Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it! [inspects the piece of paper and gasps] SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
SpongeBob: It's an ad. [talks in an announcer tone] Dear Comic Book Reader.
Patrick: That's me!
SpongeBob: [continues as announcer] Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Patrick: I never thought about anything!
SpongeBob: [continues] Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit! [uses regular tone of voice again] Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
Patrick: I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all! [makes a disgusted face] Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100. [SpongeBob's wallet falls out of his and struggles to pick it up] Patrick, could you get my wallet? [Patrick picks up SpongeBob's wallet]
Patrick: Hey, look. [pulls out $100 bill from wallet] I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money!
Patrick: [indignant] It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Patrick. [the comic book store clerk shows up]
Comic Book Store Clerk: Hey, you going to pay for those comics? [SpongeBob's arms fall off with the comics]
SpongeBob: No. [gets kicked out] Ow! Can I have my arms back? [cut to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Good luck. [doorbell rings] Coming-- [Patrick slams door against SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? [cut to Patrick at the desk]
Patrick: [hovering the pencil over the paper] SpongeBob! This pencil is broken! Why won't it make words?
SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself. [walks away with the laundry]
Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once. [flashback to Patrick's childhood]
Young Patrick: A Poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. [eats his poem and then burps and takes a bow]
Gym Teacher: How many times do I gotta tell ya, this is gym class! [blows whistle and everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at Patrick, who takes cover]
Patrick: [present time] Ohh, dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: [shadow figure of himself holding a dodgeball and wearing an evil grin] Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: [screams] Don't hit me with a dodgeball! [hides under the desk and SpongeBob turns on the lights and Gary pops out of his shell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
SpongeBob: [gets shocked] No!
Patrick: Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball! [starts crying] Whyyyyyy?! [dramatic music plays]
SpongeBob: [stops Gary's record player] You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
Patrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
Gary: [saying no suspiciously] Meow.
Patrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. [cut to SpongeBob's house with an opened window with Patrick struggling to write the poem]
Patrick: [tapping his head with the pencil] Come on, you stupid brain! work! [Patrick's brain starts working and smoke comes out] It's working! [struggling as he starts writing]
SpongeBob: [knocking] Patrick, don't strain yourself. [Patrick continues struggling as Squidward opens the window]
Squidward: Now, what's going on? [looks disgusted] What is that horrible smell? [SpongeBob comes out] Is Patrick thinking again?
Patrick: I'm making art!
Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
Patrick: That's the creative process at work! [Squidward closes the window] Ready to go to the post office? [shows a letter with his poem in it] I need to mail in my masterpiece.
Narrator: The next day... [cut to Bigshot Records]
Lead Singer: ♪--and that's why you're my cookie-wookie teddy bear!♪
Guitarist #1: I hate my life.
Keyboardist: I hate your life, too, dude.
Band Manager: People! We have 17 more songs to finish this hour! Next up is: "I Wrote This" by Patrick Star. [sniffs then holds his nose] Yick. [Guitarist #2 then takes it]
Guitarist #2: This one's really bad! It made my eyeballs throw up.
Guitarist #1: Oh yeah. [eyes disappear]
Band Manager: I don't care how awful his poem is! We spent his 100 bucks already!
Guitarist #1: Come on, guys. We're going to do this if it kills us. A 1, a 2 and a-- [cut to the cemetery where the band members are buried]
Charlie: [grave voice] They wanted you to have this.
Patrick: My song. Ahh... [cut to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Come on, let's hear it!
Patrick: Um, I don't know. You're not gonna throw dodgeballs at me?
SpongeBob: I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
Patrick: Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable.
SpongeBob: [sits on his arm chair, while Patrick pushes a big stereo in front of him] Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [on top of the stereo] SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo! [SpongeBob screams as Patrick lands on the chair and turns on the music]
SpongeBob: [covering his ears] It's really loud!
Patrick: You need it louder? Okay!
Lead singer: [singing Patrick's poem] ♪Twinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star. I made myself a sandwich. My mommy named it Fred. It tastes like beans and bacon. And smells like it's been dead. Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil. Pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point. P.U., what's that horrible smell?♪
Singer: Drum Solo! [plays drum solo. Wallpaper peels and plants become dead and picture of Mr. and Mrs. SquarePants shakes]
Lead Singer: ♪I have a head, it ends in a point. pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point.♪ [in their picture, Mr. and Mrs. SquarePants get annoyed and Mrs. SquarePants turns the picture over] ♪This song is over, except for this line, you win this round, broccoli!♪ [the song ends as SpongeBob's house peels and the stereo crashes on top of SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was.
SpongeBob: [looking like he wants to insult it] Oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
Patrick: Do you really think so?
SpongeBob: We need to get that song on the radio!
Patrick: Then let's go right now, come on! [takes SpongeBob's arm off]
SpongeBob: Darn, I just got that arm back. [cut to the radio station where SpongeBob and Patrick are going to put the song on the radio]
Patrick: I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this. [they go inside and employee screams and kicks them out and closes the door]
SpongeBob: Did you see the look on his face?
Patrick: Yeah. Did you see his ears?
SpongeBob: I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
Patrick: What record? [they see the antenna]
SpongeBob: I got an idea! [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof. Wind howls as SpongeBob and Patrick shiver] We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
Patrick: Carry me?
SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick-- [Patrick lands on top of SpongeBob and SpongeBob picks him up, struggling]
Patrick: Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward! [SpongeBob is struggling to get to the top of the antenna] Faster, SpongeBob! Faster! [Patrick sees a satellite go by. They get to the top of the antenna. Patrick stands on SpongeBob's face, takes out his record player and then puts it on the top of the antenna, the record player wobbles and falls off and Patrick catches it] Oh! Hmm-- this record won't stay put.
SpongeBob: [mumbling inaudibly]
Patrick: Good idea. [takes out bubble gum and throws it in his mouth and chews on it, while making noises and he blows a bubble]
SpongeBob: [mumbling impatiently.] [Bubble pops and sticks to Patrick's mouth]
Patrick: Oh, yeah. I forgot. [pulls gum off and sticks it to the bottom of the record player and puts it on the top of the antenna and turns on the music. Ralph is walking past a radio in a store]

Patrick: Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!
Patrick: Fan club? [song ends as the angry mob chatters indistinctly] Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song!
Fred: Who's responsible for that song on the radio? [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the roof]
SpongeBob: Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius. [Patrick drones and burps]
Fred: Let's get 'em, boys! [they start chasing them. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick found a cure. they beat them up but SpongeBob and Patrick play with instruments wildly. Patrick plays with a guitar, while SpongeBob plays with a chainsaw and a tambourine. They pant heavily while they got rid of the mob]
Patrick: And that was my new song called, "Ay..."
Fred: You know, It's not that bad.
Jimmy: Yeah. At least it got that first terrible song out of our heads.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. My song. [strums his guitar] Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star-- [they hear a whistle blow and it was Patrick's gym teacher from the childhood]
Gym Teacher: Patrick! Looks like you need another lesson! Dodgeballs ready! [everyone gets out a dodgeball]
