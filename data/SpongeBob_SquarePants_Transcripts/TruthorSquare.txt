Patchy: What?
Triumph: So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?
Patchy: None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.
Triumph: Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network. Kind of.
Patchy: It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph.
