Monica: Help! Help!
Pirate: [Laughs heartily when a heart-shaped box of chocolates is thrown at him. He groans and faints]
Brad: Monica!
Monica: [gasps] Brad! [She and Brad run up to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I might never find you. [Gary's eyes brim with tears] I promise to never leave you at your side.
Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica. [Gary is about to cry when SpongeBob turns off the TV]
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is, little guy?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's take Gary a walk in a park day!
Gary: [uninterested] Meow.
[Gary is about to slither away when SpongeBob leashes him and takes him for a walk. Scene cuts to the Snail Park where all the other snails live. SpongeBob and Gary walk in.]
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species. [Gary sees all the other snails are bored] Go ahead, have a good time. [he sees the two owners sleeping on a bench and SpongeBob walks and sits down between them] I'll just sit down for a sec. [falls asleep with the two owners. Gary sees the two other snails on the swing feeling bored then he sees one snail about to climb up the ladder where the slide is next to and falls down bored, and Gary sees the seesaw where a little snail named 'Mary' is on. Gary's eyes turn into hearts and slither to the other side of the seesaw. Mary sees Gary who is falling in love with her.]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [Gary and Mary are sea sawing up and down. Suddenly someone flips Gary on the seasaw in mid-air]
Gary: MREOOOW REOOOOW REOOOW REOOOW! OOF! [A snail slithers up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey, lightweight! What do you think you're doing with my girl? [to Mary] Come on, Mary, let's go.
Mary: Mreoooow. [Slithers next to Gary who smiles at her]
Snail Boss: [to Gary] You've just made a big mistake, pal.
Gary: Grrrrr... [both growl at each other when SpongeBob picks Gary up]
SpongeBob: Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner! [walks off with Gary in his hands]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meoooow. [Mable walks up and picks up Mary]
Mable/Monica: Let's go, Mary. [walks off]
Snail boss: Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I get through with yous, the doctor won't know which side to sow your lips back on... to! [two of the other angry snails slither up to their leader of the snail gang] That little runt is going to get what's coming to him! [scene cuts to SpongeBob making seaweed noodle stew in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew. [Scene scrolls over to Gary drawing a picture of Mary. It depicts a snail looking like Gary with lipstick]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [sets the seaweed noodle stew on the drawing of Mary] Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love. [Gary sees the seaweed noodle stew, which turns into a sculpture of Mary. Gary kisses the seaweed noodle stew] Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out. [walks off to his room getting ready for bed. Gary keeps on kissing the seaweed noodle stew and stops]
Gary: [Sighs sadly and meows. Scene cuts to SpongeBob doing touching his toes]
SpongeBob: One, two. One, two. One, two.[Gary slithers in SpongeBob's room looking sad] One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye! [sets Gary on the newspapers which are beds, then to Gary] Night-night, Gare-Bear.
[SpongeBob turns off the lights and he and Gary fall asleep. Inside of Gary's head, he dreams about him and Mary playing on a see-saw. Mary slithers toward Gary and they both kiss with their lips when the dream ends. Gary wakes up from his dream. Gary carefully slithers out of SpongeBob's house to go find Mary. The next morning, the foghorn alarm goes off and SpongeBob wakes up with a smile, he yawns]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary! [notices that Gary is not there] Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. It was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night. [goes over to the guest room where the litter box is] Peek-a-boo! [notices that Gary is not there either] Huh? Not in here either. [goes down the stairs into the kitchen] Gary? Where are you? [Notices an empty plate of seaweed noodle stew] I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself. [picks up the plate and notices a picture of Mary that Gary drew] What's this? Some sort of ransom note? [examines Gary's drawing] Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover! [He goes outside to save Gary] Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you! [scene cuts to Gary slithering toward the Snail Park where all the other snails are. He looks in a pipe]
Gary: Meow? [Gary then sees a silhouette of a girl snail on a slide. He rushes to meet her, but it is a different snail]
Elderly snail: [low voice] Meeooooooooow...
Gary: Meow reow. [slithers away. The snails #1, 2, and 3 arrive at a hole in the gate]
Snail boss: After me, fellas. [They slither into the Snail Park underneath the gate hole]
Bully snail: [struggles to get through the gate hole since the spikes on top of his shell are getting in the way] Hey, how come we never go through the front, guys?
Snail Boss: 'Cause the bad guys don't never use the front door!
Bully snail: [gets through the gate hole] Well, I think that that's pretty ridiculous. [they slither toward the other snails who are playing and doing stunts]
Snail Boss: [to all the other snails] All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... yay tall, a shell, couple of eyes? [all the other snails don't understand]
Bully snail: I think you need to be more descriptive.
Snail Boss: Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail thinks it's real funny to make goo-goo eyes on my girl. [All the other snails laugh and continue playing and doing stunts] Hey! What-- they's giggling at! They's giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You's all going on my list! You's got that? You're all on the list! [they slither off through the gate hole, but the snail with spikes is stuck again and can't get through. He then struggles and sighs. Scene cuts to SpongeBob looking for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy? [Stops and slides on some trail of snail slime that he sees and gasps] Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's. [touches the snail smile with his finger] Sounds right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test. [he licks it] Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary! [Follows Gary's snail slime. Scene cuts to Gary slithering on the sidewalk looking for Mary and her owner. He slithers through dozens of snails with their owners. They all stop and look both ways and a dozen of worms and their owners walk by. Gary continues slithering on and sees Mary with her owner. He slithers toward her while all the other snail and worm owners go across the street. Gary sees Mary and her owner walking in towards the pet store and follows inside when he bumps into the pet store owner "Harold"]
Harold: [picks up Gary] Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray? [sets Gary in a cage] There now. Isn't that better?
Gary: [to Harold, sadly] Meow reow. [Gary sees Mary leaving outside the pet store with Mable. A few seconds later, the three angry snail gang members slither inside the pet store and Gary hides in his shell. The three snail gang members slither towards Harold and asks where Gary is]
Snail Boss: Meow meow meow meow?
Harold: No. No, I haven't seen any stray snails come in here.
Snail Boss: [to the other two angry snails] He's trying to pull a fast one, fellas. [smiles evily] Why don't we give him a taste of our special brand of swift justice?!
Narrator: Two hours later... [the pet store is shown to be all broken and torn inside from the three angry snail gang members who wrecked it. Harold sits there, scared]
Snail Boss: Heh! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a thorough job.
Bully snail: Yeah. Let's get back to finding that snail. [whacks the cash register next to Harold. An orange snail with a red cap on sees the sale cage which is not broken]
Dan: Hey, Boss, there's one left.
Snail Boss: Oh yeah? [slithers towards the cage with a bat] I know you're in there, you little runt! [Breaks the sale cage with the bat, revealing a large green vicious worm]
Vicious Worm: [barks loudly]
Snail Boss: YAAAAH! [Worm attacks him]
Dan and Bully snail: HAAAAH! [run for their lives out of the store]
Snail Boss: AHH! MOMMY! MOMMY! [Gary escapes and Harold spots him]
Harold: You! [Gary keeps running] Come back here! You're gonna help me clean this place up! [Gary slithers out of the broken pet store, then Harold talks to himself] You brought this on yourself, Harold. I did not, Harold. Yes, you did, Harold. Harold, I did not. [Gary slithers quickly across the street when a car pulls up. It is revealed to be Mable and Mary inside the car and Mable honks the horn]
Mable/Monica: Come on, move it! [Gary sees Mary and his eyes google and hearts floats around] Get out of the road! [drives around Gary and drives away. Gary is about to go after her when the two angry snail gang members show up and grab Gary's tail]
Bully snail: Where do you think you're going? [Gary sees and hears Mary meowing for help. Dan and the Bully snail try to grab Gary]
Bully snail: Get' em!
Dan and Bully snail: [Gary jumps out of the way which causes them to hit each other and their eyestalks get tangled. They try to get free when they see Gary come up galloping and jumping into them. Their eyestalks become tangled and Gary catapults himself into the air. Gary is flying in mid-air then he notices that he cannot fly. Gary falls into the car and lands on the driver's head, which the driver screams and drives crazy. Gary jumps into Mable's car and lands safely into the back of the car seat and slithers towards Mary]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [SpongeBob finally stops and sees Gary and Mary inside Mable's car]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! [Gary and Mary meow at each other happily when Mable sees Gary in her car and gasps]
Mable/Monica: What the? [parks the car and SpongeBob crashes into the motor] What do you think you're doing in my car? No free rides, loafer! [picks up Gary when SpongeBob finally finds them]
SpongeBob: [to Mable] Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!
Mable/Monica: Snailnapper? [gets out of the car and puts down Gary] I don't want your dumb ol' snail.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: You did wander out of the house on your own? But why? [Mary comes slithering next to Gary and SpongeBob sees Gary and Mary purring at each other happily] Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashioned amore! [Just then, the Boss snail catches up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey! This ain't over yet, runt! [The two snails start growling at each other when Brad shows up from the TV show that Gary was watching.]
Brad: Monica? Monica!
Mable/Monica: [gasps] Brad! [The two run to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I've never find you, Monica. I was just taking Billy here for a walk. [A handsome snail named "Billy" appears next to Brad. Mary turns around and slithers towards Billy]
Mary: [To Billy] Meoooow.
Billy: [to Mary] Meow. [the two snails keep growling at each other and stop to see that Mary and Billy are together and in love]
Snail Boss: Huh?
Gary: Meow?
Brad: I promise to never again leave your side. Let's go get a steaming hot cup of joe. [the two start to walk off with their snails]
Mable/Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica.
SpongeBob: That's gotta hurt, Gary.
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail Boss: [smiles then to Gary] Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can get some seaweed noodle stew!
Gary: [smiles] Meow! [He and the Snail Boss slither off toward the dumpster]
SpongeBob: Don't stay out too late, Gary! [sighs happily] They grow up so fast.
