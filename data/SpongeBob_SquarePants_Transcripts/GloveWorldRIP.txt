[SpongeBob is reading a book in his library with Gary sitting next to him. A roller coaster crashes through the wall and hits a statue's head, causing it to hit the bookcase and the books collapse]
SpongeBob: Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?
Frankie Billy: Man! That has to be the worst amusement park I have ever been to! I mean, we're lucky to escape with our lives!
Harold: I agree! The world will be a much better place when Glove World is gone for good! [Everyone except SpongeBob claps]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did you just mention Glove World?
Frankie Billy: Yeah. Glove World. They're gonna close it. Tomorrow! Forever!
SpongeBob: Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!
Frankie Billy: Well, that depends on your definition.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, I gotta go. [SpongeBob leaves in the library]
Frankie Billy: Wh-wh-wh what about our lemonade? [Cut to Patrick's rock, SpongeBob runs and stops to knock on the rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick is in the shower inside the rock]
Patrick: I can't come out now, SpongeBob. I'm taking a shower.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna... [Patrick is out of the shower and running]
Patrick: Glove World? [SpongeBob starts running]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait! [Cutscene to Glove World Entrance. SpongeBob and Patrick made it to Glove World]
SpongeBob: There it is, Patrick. Glove World.
Patrick: Look at that guy, he must be the owner.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World forever.
Patrick: Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?! [Patrick is not wearing shorts and the owner is horrified.]
Glove World Owner: Here, son, take this. You don't wanna catch cold. [Patrick is putting on his Glove World hat as pants]
Patrick: Uh, it feels good.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that looks glovely on you, Patrick.
Patrick: Fits like a glove.
SpongeBob: Glove size fits all.
Patrick: A penny saved is a penny gloved!
SpongeBob: You can leave a glove to gloves, but you can't make it glove.
Patrick: She gloves me, she gloves me not.
SpongeBob: All's fair in glove and war.
Patrick: Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.
Glove World Owner: Well, enjoy the hat. Now if you folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.
SpongeBob: Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!
Glove World Owner: Yep. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo!
Glove World Owner: I understand your concern, but really... [SpongeBob and Patrick screams again]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo! [Zooms out through Glove World]
SpongeBob: Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.
Patrick: For all time's ride sake.
Glove World Owner: Well, seeing as it's our last day of operation anyway, and as long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure, go right ahead!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are kissing to his feet.. Cut to Tilt-A-Hurl]
SpongeBob: Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl. [SpongeBob and Patrick are getting in the seats]
Patrick: Goodbye, Tilt-A-Hurl. [The metal seat bar hits SpongeBob and Patrick. The Tilt-A-Hurl starts to spin]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls one more time] Ow! [The Tilt-A-Hurl stops]
Patrick: We'll miss you. [SpongeBob and Patrick get out of seats. Next, they are at the Glove Drop]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Glove Drop.
Patrick: So many fun memories on this ride.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave. [Everyone is on the Glove Drop. The hand pushes the Glove Drop. It's falling down. Everybody is screaming, except SpongeBob and Patrick are crying. It crashes to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick are up... sniffles] Where to next, Patrick?
Patrick: I think you know where, pal. [After that, they are at the Glove Boat]
SpongeBob: The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in the entire glove kingdom. And it's the last time I'm ever gonna ride it.
Patrick: Come on, buddy. Let's take our seats. [Everyone is on the Glove Boat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [weakly] Wee. [The Glove Boat swings back and forth, until it's upside down. Everyone falls out. Cut through the Glove World]
SpongeBob: I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World close? [The roller coaster falls on the ground]
Patrick: Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel. [Cut to the Ferris Wheel. SpongeBob sighs. The Ferris Wheel is rolling]
SpongeBob: Ew, did you hear that?
Patrick: Excuse me.
SpongeBob: No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!
Patrick: Oh no! What am I looking at?
SpongeBob: The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it moorings! [The Ferris Wheel is still rolling]
Patrick: Then you mean...
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Patrick: It somehow ripped free of it moorings! [Everyone screams as the Ferris Wheel rolls throughout Glove World] SpongeBob, what are you doing? We must remain seated at all times!
SpongeBob: We have to jump before this thing crashes! Come on! [SpongeBob jumps off the Ferris Wheel]
Patrick: Bu-bu-bu-bu? But you know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that! [SpongeBob lands face-first on the ground and then he runs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!
Patrick: I uh, oh, if you say so. [Patrick tries to jump. Patrick was out of the ferris wheel]
SpongeBob: Nice job, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks!
SpongeBob: Look! [The Ferris Wheel crashes into Glove Lake] Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.
Patrick: That's really gonna spoil the view for the residents of Glove Castle.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.
Patrick: We've gone this far, why start now?
SpongeBob: All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World is closing. I mean just look around you. Open your eyes.
Patrick: Okay. [Patrick literally does so. At the Hall of Mirrors, Tom and his son are laughing at the mirror, but the mirrors shatter. Next at the mud slide, the log falls into the mud. Thaddeus and Evelyn get leeches on their body. At the glove karts, Harold honks the wheel]
Harold (red fish): Move it, slowpoke!
Fred: Hey, who you calling slowpoke, you sardine! [Everyone is stuck in the glove karts. Patrick closed his eyes]
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick? Glove World is on its last legs.
Patrick: Yeah, or on its last finger.
SpongeBob: I just wish there was something we can do. [Patrick smiles]
Patrick: I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World to cheer ourselves up.
SpongeBob: Wait a second. [gasps] That's it!
Patrick: It is?
SpongeBob: Of course, we just have to fix Glove World.
Patrick: We do?
SpongeBob: Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World open. Are you with me?
Patrick: I think so. Yeah, I'm here. [Cut to the hall of mirrors, and SpongeBob is in the mirror]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it. Do you remember what to say?
Patrick: SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...
SpongeBob: [whispers] Hall of mirrors.
Patrick: Hall of Mirrors!
Nat: Wow, new and improved? [SpongeBob turns into Nat] Wow, that's fantastic!
SpongeBob: It's working.
Ugly Fish: Oh, I'll try it. [SpongeBob turns into Ugly Fish] Hey! What kind of mirror is this!? [Ugly Fish hits SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Ugly Fish: I'm glad they're closing this place down! [Cut the Bubble Poppin' Boy and Monroe]
Bubble Poppin' Boy: Hey there, kid. [Monroe kicks his leg] Ow! You little brat! I have had it! Three and a half weeks of working here and this is how I'm treated!? You're gonna have to pay for my shin-replacement surgery!
Glove World Owner: I'm sorry you feel that way, but if we were to accommodate every employee- [Bubble Poppin' Boy takes off the glove mascot and throws it at the owner]
Bubble Poppin' Boy: Accommodate this, boss man! [walks away]
Glove World Owner: Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?
Patrick: Mr. Owner, Mr. Owner! Can I wear the Glovey Glove costume? Please, please? I've always wanted to try it on. And also, this hat you lent me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See? [Close up to Patrick's butt]
Glove World Owner: Well, sure, why not? I mean, what could go wrong?
Patrick: Thanks! [Patrick laughs. Cut to ice cream stand]
Ice cream employee: Here you go, little boy.
Monroe: Thanks! [Patrick appears]
Patrick: Oh, oh! Glove ice cream! [Monroe cries] Thanks! [In the Glove Karts, Patrick cuts in line]
Sandals: The park mascot, cutting in line? [Monroe appears being angry]
Monroe: And he stole my ice cream! [Patrick has Monroe's ice cream on his mouth, and spits all over]
Patrick: I thought he gave it to me. [SpongeBob looks the glove swing is stopping]
SpongeBob: Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix. [The ride operator is asleep. And SpongeBob appears] Excuse me. [SpongeBob pushes the ride operator off his seat and puts on his glove hat. He pulls the lever to the fastest setting. The glove swing is fastest. The riders scream. Billy's hat flies away. Lloyd's shirt flies away. Mabel's hair flies away. Various articles of clothing fly away] Much better. [The roller coaster flew off the track. Everyone screams as they fly away. SpongeBob runs through the glove pole] Ooh. [SpongeBob is pushing the glove pole.] There. [The gray fish lands safely]
Gray Fish: Huh? Hey, I landed safely! [All of them land safely]
All: Hey, we landed safely! [The glove pole then snaps and all of them fall on the ground. SpongeBob steps back. Patrick is chasing with a mallet. Everyone screams]
Fish: He's insane! Run for your lives! [Everyone is exiting Glove World]
Patrick: Come back here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! What are you doing?
Patrick: I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.
SpongeBob: Listen, Patrick, do you hear that?
Patrick: Yeah, it's the sound of total silence. [The tumbleweed appears and crosses through the empty Glove World] Plus tumbleweeds.
SpongeBob: Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World, and now it's over. And they're gonna close it, and there's nothing we can do.
Patrick: Well, there is one thing we can do. [At night, SpongeBob and Patrick are chained up at the Glove World entrance. The Glove World owner comes]
Glove World Owner: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: We're doing what any concerned, responsible person does when they're left no other choice.
Patrick: Yeah, brother! We're chaining ourselves to a gate.
Glove World! Owner: Well, I hope you don't plan on staying chained for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.
SpongeBob and Patrick: The grand what?
Glove World! Owner: The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself. [The Glove Universe is grand opening with fireworks.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Glove Universe?!
Glove World Owner: Isn't she something? [sighs] Well, you two have a good night.
SpongeBob: Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!
Patrick: [Excited] You bet!
SpongeBob: Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.
Patrick: [Cluelessly] What key?
SpongeBob: The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.
Patrick: [Now remembering] Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you told me to keep that in a safe place, remember?
SpongeBob: [Curious and worried] So where you keeping it?
Patrick: [Stupidly] At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will ever find it! [SpongeBob exasperated with Patrick's stupidity has a blank face, as it zooms out the Glove World Entrance] SpongeBob?
