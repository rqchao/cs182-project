[Episode starts when SpongeBob feeds Gary. Then, SpongeBob pours the organic snail food into Gary's food bowl and Gary eats the organic snail food. SpongeBob throws the can of organic snail food by the dirty dishes, and a barrel hits SpongeBob back in the living room and his can of snail food lands on his nose. Gary slithers to him.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy. [pushes his nose and his Krusty Krab uniform hat pops up from his head He walks out the door] See you later, Gare. [Gary is seen holding a leash in his mouth] Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun… together. Okay… …Love you, Gare-bear. Bye. [goes outside &amp; closes the door. Gary picks up a leash. He lassos the leash and opens the top cabinet and gets out a can of snail food and puts it next to them. He lassos the soda drinking cowboy hat and floats it right on top of the chair he slithers towards the chair with the remote in his mouth, while the soda drinking cowboy hat lands on his shell. He turns on the TV as we see a cowboy riding a sea horse]
SpongeBob: Poor little snail just wanted some fun time. [sighs] I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now. [walks away, while Gary is watching TV laughing and meowing. Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is sweeping all the dust from the floor with his broom next to the customer sitting at the table eating a Krabby Patty. Another customer walks in] Welcome to the Kru- [notices that he has a purple pet worm on a leash which barked] Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.
Customer: Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone. [to his pet worm] Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.
Mr. Krabs: Eh? [walks towards the customer blocking the double doors] Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price. [laughs] SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties. [we hear Gary meow inside SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay. [walks towards the phone and answers it and calls Gary but no answer] Too distraught to even answer the phone.
Phone: [in SpongeBob's voice] Hello. You've reached SpongeBob and… C'mon Gary. [in Gary's Voice] Meow. [SpongeBob's voice] Gary. [laughs] The two of us are having too much fun together to answer the phone right now. so, leave the massage and will call you right back. Not as long as we take a break and have fun… together! ['SpongeBob &amp; Gary laugh]
SpongeBob: My outgoing message is a lie. [cut to SpongeBob's home where Gary is still watching the TV on the phone] Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up…
Gary: [meowing and laughing and drinking a soda in a cowboy hat]
SpongeBob: Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon. [hangs up the phone and sighs. cut to that night where SpongeBob changes the "open" sigh to "closed" sigh and walks out the door where he closes the double doors. Just then we see Mr. Krabs working on the tar machine]
Mr. Krabs: Well, well, well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.
SpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.
SpongeBob: You're the best, Mr. Krabs! [cut to SpongeBob running home] Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?
Timmy: Wow, Dad, is it really mine to keep?
Fred: Sure, son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely. [SpongeBob stops and sees Timmy with a blue mini eel] And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.
SpongeBob: Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.
Timmy: Hey, thanks, Dad.
SpongeBob: [runs over there] They're so precious! [we see a bunch of mini colorful and cute eels surrounding the mysterious store owner lady] SOLD! I'll take that one right there!
Store Owner: You wish to have one of my rare and extremely dangerous… huh?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, this is the one. [picks a green mini eel which is in a small cage]
Store Owner: Beware, boy, this is no ordinary pet!
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!
Store Owner: You must to understand. These pets can be very unstable. especially around other pets! [shows a picture of a cat next to another green mini eel which he growls at it]
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye. [walks off]
Store Owner: Why bother? They never listen. [sighs]
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is still watching TV, drinking a soda from the soda drinking cowboy hat]
Cowboy: [on TV] Sheriff, I've caught the bank robber. [throws a small cowboy hat on the table] There's your culprit right here. Now cuff him. [SpongeBob appears from behind the TV]
SpongeBob: Hello, Gary!
Gary: [Sees SpongeBob by taking off the drinking soda cowboy hat then gets bored] Meow.
SpongeBob: I've brought you a surprise. [takes out a mini green eel from behind his back] Your very own play pal. [sets it on the chair next to Gary] His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back.
[He runs off to get something. Gary meows at Puffy Fluffy, who takes one look at him and snarls. SpongeBob comes back with Gary's food bowl while Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self.]
SpongeBob: Eat up, you two. [sets food bowl down and pours a can of snail food inside it. Gary slithers to his food bowl and starts to eat but SpongeBob stops him] Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy. [SpongeBob gets a marker and writes Puffy Fluffy's name with a slash "Puffy Fluffy" on the food bowl] Come here, you. [sets him next to the other side of Gary's food bowl] There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas.
[He walks off; When Gary starts eating his food,  Puffy Fluffy scares him, eats Gary's food bowl and Gary runs and hides behind the wall next to the TV. Puffy Fluffy chases after him and is about to eat him when SpongeBob comes back]
SpongeBob: Done! [Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self] Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot! [sits down on the chair and begins to eat when he sees Gary hiding behind the TV, scared] Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends. [picks up Gary and Puffy Fluffy toward the toys] Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond. [went back to his chair] Great, now my enchiladas are cold.
[Gary plays with his squeaky toys with Puffy Fluffy when Puffy Fluffy scares him. Fluffy rips the squeaky carrot toy with his sharp teeth onto SpongeBob's enchilada dinner. Puffy Fluffy jaws on Gary, but Gary runs and hops on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?! [picks Gary from behind his head] Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight. [cut to the living room where SpongeBob puts Gary down on a small bed] I hope you're happy now.
Gary: [doubtful] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend. [sets Puffy Fluffy on the small bed and Gary gets scared. SpongeBob covers them up with a small green blanket] Aww, look at you two so cute together.
Gary: Meooooooow.
SpongeBob: I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.
[He walks off to bed when Puffy Fluffy snarls at Gary; cut to SpongeBob going in his bed in his room]
SpongeBob: Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with. [goes to sleep when Gary bursts through the door and runs toward SpongeBob scared]
Gary: [in horror] Meow! [hops on SpongeBob's bed]
SpongeBob: Gary! Shame on you! [takes Gary back in the living room] Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless. [takes off the blanket and sees it] See? There he is, fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please? [sets Gary back on a small bed and covers him with a small green blanket] Good night. [He turns off the light and closes the door. Gary looks at Puffy Fluffy but his skin deflates, revealing that it was not him. Just then there's a noise coming from the down stairs kitchen. Gary goes into the kitchen and sees a big green thing behind the fridge eating. Gary slithers over there. It is Puffy Fluffy as a monster, and it roars.]
Gary: Meow!
Puffy Fluffy Monster: Rawr! [sticks out four tongues with large sharp teeth]
Gary: [in terror] Meow! [Cut to SpongeBob who is sleeping. Cut back to Gary slithering toward the oven. Gary looks behind, grabs a pan, and turns around. Gary tries to stop Puffy Fluffy Monster with the pan. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping. A bit of slobber hangs from his lips as if he were a kid sleeping as lullaby music is heard in the background Cut back to Gary being chased by Puffy Fluffy Monster]
Gary: Mah! [Puffy Fluffy Monster chases him into SpongeBob's library. Gary stops in front of the books, turns around, and sees Puffy Fluffy Monster who's about to eat them. They get away quickly as they can and hides behind a pile of books, as Puffy Fluffy Monster chases Gary around the pile of books and uses his big tail fin and hits the fireplace where the log is. Gary gets away quickly as they can and dodges the fire which burns the library all over the place. Puffy Fluffy Monster scares Gary by the fire. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping when he sniffs something burning coming from down the stairs]
SpongeBob: [talking to his sleep] Mmmmm. You're making meatballs, Grandma? Time for dinner already? [Cut back to Gary, in the bathroom putting out the fire with a bucket full of water from the tub. The fire is put out]
Gary: Phew. [sees that Puffy Fluffy Monster is ruining several of SpongeBob's pants with his big sharp teeth. Puffy Fluffy Monster roars at Gary, and he screams. Puffy Fluffy Monster spits out several of SpongeBob's torn pants] Meow! [runs towards Puffy Fluffy Monster Who's ruining the library books and tries to stop him on the back with their teeth. Puffy Fluffy Monster looks at Gary trying to stop him with his teeth on his back but he hits him toward the bookshelf]
Gary: Oooow! Mah! [sees Puffy Fluffy Monster who's about to eat him but he jump over him and runs quickly toward the garage he turn around screams and sees Puffy Fluffy about to eat him. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping and the ceiling is starting to crack and fall. Cut back to Gary who is chased by Puffy Fluffy rushing towards the wall]
Gary: Mah! [being chased by Puffy Fluffy Monster in the living room. Zooms out to SpongeBob's Pineapple house which is shaking. The next morning, the foghorn alarm goes off with the ceiling cracks falling off]
SpongeBob: [mumbles as he rubs both eyes due to the fact that it's morning] Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along! [notices a piece of cracked ceiling] Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh, well, what are you gonna do? [opens the galley door which falls over] That's unusual. Whoa! [sees the library which is a total wreck] My library! [gasps] And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut! [gasps] My clothes! [picks up his torn pants] This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for... [gets mad] ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend. [goes down the stairs to the gym door] Gary! You are in big trouble, mister! [tries to open the exercise room door but it's locked] Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear?[we see Gary is about to get eaten by Puffy Fluffy Monster which he puts his four long tongues on Gary] Gary? All right, Gary, you have left me no choice! [rushes toward the door, knocks it over. looks up, gasps in shock as he sees Gary about to get eaten by Puffy Fluffy Monster]
SpongeBob: Gary! [to Gary, which he didn’t believe that Gary was getting eaten] You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary! [Puffy Fluffy Monster looks at SpongeBob] Bad! Bad! Bad boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad! [Puffy Fluffy Monster puts down Gary gently on the floor] I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh, hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy? [Puffy Fluffy Monster bites SpongeBob with one of his four long tongues] What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt.
Gary: [gets up and sees SpongeBob about to get eaten] MEOW!
SpongeBob: This is exactly what I was talking about--
[Puffy Fluffy Monster shuts SpongeBob up with one of his four long tongues. Gary rushes as fast as he could and comes back with his cowboy gear on when dramatic western music plays. He lassos his leash and hits Puffy Fluffy Monster right in the face and it lets go of SpongeBob covered in monster slime. Gary lassos his leash and puts it through Puffy Fluffy Monster's four long tongues and pulls on ‘em really tight. It rushes outside the house and runs off roaring in pain.]
SpongeBob: [runs out] Fluffy! Fluffy, wait! [Gary slithers to SpongeBob] Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?
[Gary looks at the screen disappointed. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob carries Gary into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Ah, this is more like it. From now on, I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home. [puts Gary down. Mr. Krabs gasps]
Mr. Krabs: What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out. [puts a Krusty Krab uniform hat on Gary]
Mr. Krabs: Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so? [takes out a spatula] Serve ‘em up, snail! [hands Gary a spatula. Gary sighs]
