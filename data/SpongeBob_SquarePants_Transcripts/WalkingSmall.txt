[metallic roaring]
Plankton: [enters Goo Lagoon and he uses his bulldozer to remove the sign. He leaves his bulldozer] Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly 17 minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the [puts up a sign] 'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.' [he makes a loud squeaking noise that catches some of the beachgoers' attention]
Tina: Do you hear something? [Peterson doesn't hear anything, and he shakes his head "no." The Lifeguard thinks the sound is coming from his megaphone, looks inside it and then turns it upside-down and shakes it.]
Plankton: [takes out megaphone] Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--
Billy: [grabs Plankton's bulldozer] Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Evelyn: Put that down, Billy, that has germs on it.
Billy: [drops the bulldozer] Aw, mom.
Plankton: [talks through megaphone] You'll see. [throws away the megaphone] You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious... I can deny it no longer... [zoom out] I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need... [giant foot almost steps on Plankton but he dives out of the way] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Plankton: Yes. He's the one. [laughs evilly. The sand on his head falls off]
SpongeBob: I'll have one... [some kid cuts in front of him]
Monroe: Two, please. [Lou gives him two ice creams] Thanks. [walks off]
SpongeBob: One, please. [Electric Eel slithers through SpongeBob and grabs the ice cream]
Eel: 'Scuse me. [walks off licking the ice cream]
SpongeBob: One, please.
Lou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.
SpongeBob: Aww, barnacles. [he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams] Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
Plankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. [blows his nose] I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! [cries] I don't know what to do with the other one! [SpongeBob is confused; Plankton cries then stops for a second and looks at SpongeBob and cries again.]
SpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Plankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob: Sure! [starts to lick the ice cream]
Plankton: SpongeBob... [SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob's attention] SPONGEBOB!!!
SpongeBob: [turns towards Plankton] Yeah? [spits out ice cream as he talks]
Plankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. [SpongeBob licks his fingers] You can have anything you want with a little training. [SpongeBob licks his fingers again]
SpongeBob: Training?
Plankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
SpongeBob: Assertive, huh?
Plankton: That's right.
SpongeBob: Anything I want. [licks his lips] Sounds great! [spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking]
Plankton: Wonderful. [laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob] SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
SpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
Plankton: No, no, be assertive! [SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guy's pockets]
SpongeBob: ...beep, beep! [Plankton facepalms]
Plankton: NOT INSERTIVE! [adult fish checks his watch, then walks away] SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
SpongeBob: But I'm a spo...
Plankton: Don't say it! [Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob's ice cream] There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
SpongeBob: Ice cream! [Plankton gets up and runs behind Electric Eel]
Plankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! [Electric Eel turns around]
Eel: What, who said that? [talks to SpongeBob] Was it you?
Plankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
SpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!
Plankton: Great! Now let him have it!
SpongeBob: [misunderstanding what Plankton means] You can have it.
Eel: Say, thanks! [walks off]
Plankton: No! [jumps inside SpongeBob's mouth] I'll show ya how! [voicing for SpongeBob, SpongeBob stands still.] Hey, pencil neck! [Electric Eel turns around] Yeah, you... slither over here! [Electric Eel walks over to SpongeBob] Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! [Electric Eel looks scared; he throws the ice cream onto SpongeBob's face and runs away crying]
SpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!
Plankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
Plankton: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! [throws ice cream on  his tongue, hitting Plankton who is still on it. Later, he is using a metal detector, and it beeps] I found something!
Scooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? [SpongeBob hands the equipment to him]
SpongeBob: Sure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
SpongeBob: [misunderstands] Hey, do you want to take a hike with me?
Scooter Like Fish: Yeah!
Plankton: [angry] ...NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob: [sees a ditch] Hey! Go check in that ditch! [points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest]
Scooter Like Fish: Wow! Buried treasure! Thanks!
SpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
SpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
Fish: But I'm wearing sandals!
SpongeBob: Okay, never mind! [Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob] It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
Plankton: [putting things into a suitcase] Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. [puts on a black hat] I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
SpongeBob: No it's not!
Plankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
SpongeBob: But what about airline food?
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! [rimshot] See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? [Plankton throws his hat down]
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
Plankton: Okay, but this is your last chance! [points to people trying to get a tan] Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
SpongeBob: Just watch me! [runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away] Man, this thing is sandy!
Fred: My leg! [after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp]
Plankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach! [SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown] SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
SpongeBob: Well, not all of me.
Hot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Plankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob: I'll do better than that! [he stretches his tongue to eat everybody's hotdogs]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Breaking your wind! [SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball! [SpongeBob pops the volleyball and trumpets like an elephant. Everybody leaves the beach]
SpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! [sees Plankton missing] Plankton? [Plankton is driving a crane] Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
Plankton: Exactly.
SpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
Plankton: Oops. [he presses a button in his crane, and the "Mega Bucket" sign comes out from the ground]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mega Bucket?! You used me... FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT! [voice cracks] That wasn't nice!
Plankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?
Plankton: Huh? What are you doing?! [SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were] Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! [a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyelashes] Butterfly kisses... can't take it... it's too cute... it's disgusting! [Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard]
SpongeBob: What happened? [points to surfboard]
Scooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!
SpongeBob: No problem! [makes himself a surfboard]
Scooter: Whoa! [grabs the surfboard] Killer!
Plankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back! [everyone comes back] Wait! [everyone steps on Plankton. He is squished. Scooter is surfing]
Scooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting. [bunches up into a ball] NEED... HATRED... [crawls away]
SpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone? [everyone uses SpongeBob as the ball] Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!
