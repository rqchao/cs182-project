[The episode begins with Bikini Bottom news.] 
Johnny Elaine: This is a Bikini Bottom News special report. [the screen shows Perch Perkins at the Bikini Bottom power plant with the police] Perch?
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!
[The Dirty Bubble is at the very top of the power plant, holding the police chief hostage.] 
Dirty Bubble: Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack! [laughs and holds the chief in the air with his tongue] 
Police chief: Do what he says! [groans as the Dirty Bubble squeezes him tighter] 
Perch Perkins: [appears from the left] Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act? 
Dirty Bubble: [releases the police chief and grabs Perch] Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV? [laughs as he goes to eat Perch] 
[Just then, three officers seize the Dirty Bubble with giant bubble wands.] 
Officer Slugfish: Drop him, airhead! 
[The officers force the Dirty Bubble to let Perch go.] 
Perch Perkins: Yipe! [falls off-screen] 
Officer Johnson: [grunts while seizing the Dirty Bubble] I got him! 
[The officers shove the Dirty Bubble into the bottle.] 
Dirty Bubble: Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in—[gets pushed into the bottle by the chief] 
Police chief: Jail! 
[The Dirty Bubble, still in the bottle, is placed in a prison cell in Bikini Bottom Jail.] 
Johnny: Six months later... 
[Two men carry the bottle containing the dirty bubble inside. One man opens the bottle, takes out the bubble wand, dips it into the liquid and blows out the Dirty Bubble, now sparky clean and reformed.] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble. [laughs] 
Warden: Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [gives the Clean Bubble a handshake] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down! [puts on his hat] 
Warden: [holds out a paper with KK on it] Here's the address of your new job. [gives the paper to the Clean Bubble and blows him away with a fan]
Clean Bubble: I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns. [crashes into the Krusty Krab sign] The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place! [enters the restaurant and gives a friendly handshake to Mr. Krabs] Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do? [slams his face into the glass doors] Greet people at the door? Serve the food? 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail. 
Clean Bubble: [gets real nervous when he sees a pile of dirty dishes] D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something? 
Mr. Krabs: Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy? 
Clean Bubble: Just call me Sparkles. 
[The Clean Bubble becomes nervous and looks at the dirty dishes. One drop of slime nearly hits the Clean Bubble.] 
Clean Bubble: [sweating] Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean.
[Pans screen to the right, to reveal what appears to be a walking stack of frozen Krabby Patties coming out of the freezer.]
Clean Bubble: Ah?
[SpongeBob removes all the frozen Krabby Patties from himself and places them onto the grill]
SpongeBob: Yeah. [shivers] Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front. [laughs]
Clean Bubble: [laughs with SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob.
Clean Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh... DB, uh... DB.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB. [gasps] We'll be daily pallies!
[Squidward rings the desk bell multiple times]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [grabs spatula from his hat] Back to work! [flips patties while singing to self]
Clean Bubble: [shudders] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [cleaning a dirty dish] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!
[Dish is sparkling clean. Clean Bubble gasps.]
Clean Bubble: Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Oh, I must be cured!
[Clean Bubble continuously cleans the dirty dishes with his body, while beginning to turn evil.]
Clean Bubble: Wiping up filth, wiping clean every crack! [transforms to the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back! [evil laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble? [Whistles while flipping a patty. Suddenly turns back surprised. Screams.]
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs]
SpongeBob: Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs at SpongeBob's face]
[Dirty Bubble gets closer to SpongeBob. SpongeBob threatens to spray at him with the sink hose]
SpongeBob: What did you do with DB? [Sobs. Looks at the newly transformed Clean Bubble.]
[Clean Bubble glows and smiles]
SpongeBob: DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?
Clean Bubble: Yes, SpongeBob, it's me. I'm trying to change my evil ways and stay clean.
SpongeBob: Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free! [offers a handshake]
[Clean Bubble happily offers a handshake]
Mr. Krabs: [comes from the right with an electric fan, blowing away the Clean Bubble and SpongeBob] Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for ya!
[Transitions to Mr. Krabs and the Clean Bubble at the bathroom]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this new job is very exclusive and very French.
Clean Bubble: Hmm? Ooh-la-la! [smiles]
Mr. Krabs: [kicks open a filthy toilet] Eau de Toilette!
Clean Bubble: [gasps] Oh, sacre pee-yew! [frowns in worried disgust]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing at him] Make it sparkle! [pulls up pants, and walks off, humming]
[SpongeBob peeks out from the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB. [grabs a toilet scrubber from his hat] I will clean them for you. Taupe sweet, mon ami. [laughs]
[Clean Bubble enthusiastically flushes the closest toilet. His eyes hallucinate.]
Clean Bubble: Dirt, dirt! Beautiful dirt! [goes into the toilet]
SpongeBob: Zut alors! [checks toilet] DB? [Peeks into toilet, and gasps as the Dirty Bubble gradually comes out. Runs off from toilet cubicle] Incoming!
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laughs. Repeatedly sings "Alouette" into each toilet, and shoves customers down the toilet.]
Fred: '[Screams while running away]
Dirty Bubble: Pow! Hold onto your certy, here comes the dirty!
[SpongeBob hoses down the Dirty Bubble with absorbed sink water. The Clean Bubble is transformed back.]
Clean Bubble: Thanks for keeping me clean, SpongeBob! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!
[Transitions to a reveal a comic book named "Dirty Bubble Returns!"]
Elaine: For weeks, SpongeBob worked with DB to stay clean and good!
[Moves from a comic frame with Dirty Bubble stealing Patrick's chocolate-coated strawberry ice-cream to SpongeBob hosing down on the Dirty Bubble into the Clean Bubble with a spray bottle.]
[Dirty Bubble then appears in a comic frame where he has appeared in a laundromat, but SpongeBob grabs him and places him into the dishwasher while Old Man Jenkins still has clean washed clothes.]
[The Dirty Bubble appears yet again in another comic frame where he spits out a fountain of mud onto a bus "White Suit Society" while the fish of the bus scream and panic. SpongeBob comes in surfing and washes the Dirty Bubble down. The Clean Bubble comes on the surfboard]
[Transition to the Krusty Krab. Squidward is sleeping at the cash register area, while SpongeBob mops the floor. The Clean Bubble comes in to serve a tray of three Krabby Patties and two drinks, while whistling.]
Clean Bubble: [serves the tray to the family of customers] Enjoy those patties! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!
Clean Bubble: Thanks to you, SpongeBob, I'll never be dirty again! [laughs]
Patrick: Speaking of dirty... [Picks his belly button to reveal bellybutton gunk. Patrick stares at it menacingly, and flicks it off.] Ew.
[Bellybutton gunk lands on the Clean Bubble. The gunk spreads around him. The gunk finally cracks open to reveal the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs evilly] You want me clean, but I ain't willing! I've gotta be me, by being a villain! [Evilly laughs. Looks left and right, then moves out to the left]
Patrick: [sheds a tear] Aww... That's nice. He found his rainbow!
SpongeBob: [surprised face] Uh-oh. [nervous face]
[At a news report of Dirty Bubble]
Elaine: The Dirty Bubble has been seen everywhere, defiling dozens of decent denizens with dirty deeds!
[Two kids play with mud. The Dirty Bubble sucks up everything in the mud pit including the mud and kids. He spits out the kids clean.]
Girl and boy: Clean? [looks at each other and cries]
[At the cabin of an abandoned ship named "The Buccaneer," surrounded by a number of landmines]
Pirate: So I said to the scalawag, "Listen here, you–" [The Dirty Bubble cleans him, transforming him into a chubby sailor.]
Chubby sailor: It's time to have tea and cakes!
Sailor #1: Get him! [everyone punches the chubby sailor]
[The Dirty Bubble comes towards a poorly maintained building. The family of three run out of the building. He cleans the entire building.]
Family of three: Yay!
[Dirty Bubble smashes building from top to bottom and laughs.]
Family of three: [disappointed] Aww.
[At the school "Poseidon Elementary"]
Old teacher: Yes, Billy, 2 plus 2 still equals 4.
[The Dirty Bubble comes and wipes out the old teacher's face]
Old teacher: [muffled] Rumpy rumpkins. [rubs face and mumbles]
Perch Perkins: Breaking news, the Dirty Bubble just wiped all the teacher's dirty looks right off their faces! Who will be next?
Dirty Bubble: [comes up to Perch Perkins and rubs off his face] No more pimples, no more bumps, no more news guy's dirty looks! [evil laugh, kisses Perkin's face to reveal an inverted face]
Perch Perkins: Hello– Urrgh, that got in my mouth!
[Dirty Bubble kicks out Perkins]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs, but gets hosed] Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!
[The Dirty Bubble's grime is shown not to be wiped out]
Dirty Bubble: Be gone, hygiene. I'm too big to stay clean! [follows toward the hose while eating the water, then sucks up the entire hose and fire hydrant]
SpongeBob: [panicking sounds]
[The Dirty Bubble spits out five miniature versions of the Dirty Bubble]
SpongeBob: [more panicking sounds]
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laugh]
[Mini Dirty Bubbles bite SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs spatula] It's on, now! [pops four of five miniature Dirty Bubbles with his spatula. Stomps on the final miniature Dirty Bubble]
[Dirty Bubble looks stumped. SpongeBob launches toward the Dirty Bubble, but bounces off. Dirty Bubble chases after SpongeBob.]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs as he chases SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [continually banging against the walls of the Dirty Bubble] Help, help, call the cops, call Mr. Krabs, call my mommy!
[Dirty Bubble looks to his right, and goes to Goo Lagoon. He rips through the sign. Shows a few kids playing in Goo Lagoon, while two unaware fish lay back on separate towels underneath an umbrella.]
Dirty Bubble: I think, for dessert, I'll eat more dirt! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Not Goo Lagoon!
[Dirty Bubble sucks up Goo Lagoon]
SpongeBob: [grabs out paper and pencil to write quickly his last words] Thank you, my beloved pet Gary, thank you, my big pineapple, and my toolshed, and my mailbox, and Patrick! [Sobs as the dirt level increasingly gets higher and higher. Starts absorbing all the dirt.] Uh, what? Wow. Sometimes I just forget how absorbent I am. [proceeds to spin around inside like clothes in a side-loader washing machine]
Dirty Bubble: Wait, what? Ow, just... stop spinning, you sponge! You're stealing my grunge! [slowly shrinks, stammering] Stop that rhyme! [screams as he is absorbed by SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob falls into Goo Lagoon's seabed. Burps out an shrunken version of the Dirty Bubble.]
Dirty Bubble: [high pitched] I may be a squirt, but I'm still full of dirt! [evil laughs]
SpongeBob: Aww, little mini DB is so cute!
[Dirty Bubble spits dirt onto SpongeBob's eyelid. Officer Johnson catches Dirty Bubble and puts him into a jar held by lady officer]
Lady officer: We got him!
SpongeBob: Every time I wash dishes, I will think of you.
Dirty Bubble: Hmph. Every time I have nightmares, I'll think of you, too! [complaining noises]
Lady officer: Thank you, citizen. We'll take it from here.
SpongeBob: [Pretends to be the Dirty Bubble] It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it. [evil laugh]
[Police officers gasp]
SpongeBob: Just kidding! [laughs]
[Police officers laugh with him. SpongeBob suddenly feels the urge to sneeze, splattering goo all over the place.]
Police officers: [angrily] Gesundheit!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [looks at lady officer] You got some schmutz under there. [Wipes off goo from her face. Grabs out a tissue and laughs.]
[Screen transitions to a circular black fadeout.]
