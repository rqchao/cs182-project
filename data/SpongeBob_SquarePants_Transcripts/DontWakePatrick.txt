[The episode begins with SpongeBob getting himself ready to go to sleep. He stretches, yawns, and hops into bed. He puts on his nightcap, fluffs up his pillow, and lays down to sleep. But when he breathes, he notices something was wrong with his mouth. He smacks his lips and opens his mouth. Inside, his tongue is all dried up and a family of hillbilly germs move away because they're home has no water. SpongeBob realizes that he is thirsty, so he gets out of bed to get a drink of water. He walks downstairs and into the living room.]
SpongeBob: [notices the plant on the edge of the table] Oops. [pushes plant back] Doink. [pours water in a glass and drinks it; but he spits it out after seeing the refrigerator open] I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh? [closes the fridge and sees the living room a complete mess] Huh, I don't remember making such a mess. [spaghetti falls on his face] And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti. [opens his stomach, revealing a lite candle, a Krabby Patty, some fries, and a soda] Nope. [puts spaghetti in his stomach and closes it; then a big noise from upstairs] Huh?
[The noise gets louder and scarier. SpongeBob walks over to the stairs to investigate. As he got closer, a shadowy figure comes down the stairs. SpongeBob quivers with fear. But, to his surprise, the shadowy figure turned out to be Patrick, who is sleep-walking.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [Patrick sleep-walks in the living room] Wake up, Patrick! [grabs Patrick's trunks, but it slips off his hands] Whoa!
[Patrick flies through the air, but continues to sleep-walk. SpongeBob attempts to wake Patrick up by banging a pot with a stick, but nothing's working. Then he tries to wake him up with an air horn, but nothing's working.]
SpongeBob: [hops on Patrick's head to open his eye lids, but falls off] Whoa!
[SpongeBob grabs his alarm clock, turns up the volume, and sets it to the waking hour. SpongeBob's alarm clock bellows a loud noise in Patrick's face. The noise was so loud that it even woke Squidward and several people up. The car alarm goes off and several worms start barking. The alarm clock did not effect Patrick and he continues to sleep-walk. Patrick sleep-walks into the kitchen, activates a toaster, and splatters butter on it. Then he eats the toaster and toast pops out from his mouth. Patrick sleep-walks to the fridge, opens it, and peeks inside.]
Patrick: [screams and eats an ice cream carton]
[Patrick splatters eggs on his buttocks. He walks through the kitchen wall with the fridge on his head. He throws the fridge through the wall and sleep-walks outside. Patrick sleep-walks towards the street where an ongoing traffic.]
SpongeBob: [screams and runs after Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks across the street. Luckily, none of the boats hit him. SpongeBob goes after Patrick, but is almost hit by a boat.]
SpongeBob: [screams and grunts as he gets hit by the boats]
[The boats sending SpongeBob flying to the other side of the street. Patrick steps on SpongeBob while sleep-walking to another house. SpongeBob spits sand out of his eyes.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [runs over to Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks to the front door, opens it, and enters inside.]
SpongeBob: No! [runs after Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks across the hallway while a married couple are sleeping in their bed. SpongeBob becomes worried that Patrick might make a loud noise that will wake them up. Patrick sleep-walks towards a collection of model ships.]
SpongeBob: [screams and turns Patrick away from the model ships] Whew. [exclaims as Patrick goes to knock over a vase]
[SpongeBob grabs the vase before it fell. Then Patrick starts making loud noises in his sleep. Patrick continues to make loud noises as the male fish starts waking up. SpongeBob jumps onto Patrick and covers his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Shh! Shhh!
[Patrick calms down and the male fish goes back to sleep. SpongeBob slaps Patrick's butt and Patrick sleep-walks out.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Phew.
Male Fish: [turns on the light] What the?!
SpongeBob: [gets kicked out, screams, and lands on the ground] Ooh! [gets stepped on by Patrick] Ow! [grabs Patrick's feet and gets dragged]
[Green fumes seeps through the air. Patrick sniffs it and yawns.]
SpongeBob: [sniffs the fumes] Bleach! [the fumes form into a fist and punch SpongeBob's face] Ow!
[The fumes are coming from the Chum Bucket. Patrick goes around the back, enters inside and follows the scent of the fumes. The scent leads to a pot full of chum leftover from Plankton. Patrick grabs the bucket and goes to eat it.]
Patrick: Mm. Ahh...
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no! [grabs the pot] Don't!
[SpongeBob struggles to keep the pot full of chum away from Patrick. Patrick licks SpongeBob's head with his tongue, which tickles SpongeBob. SpongeBob accidentally drops the pot into his mouth and swallows the chum. The chum made him incredibly sick to the stomach and lets out a small, green fume. The fume then makes a skulls and breathes into SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: [notices Patrick gone] Huh? [screams]
[Patrick sleep-walks into a dance studio. SpongeBob follows, grabs a carton of popcorn, and takes a seat. Patrick performs a little dance in his sleep, then sleep-walks off the stage.]
SpongeBob: Ohh! [claps and sheds a tear]
[Patrick sleep-walks out of the dance studio and slips on a banana peel. The peel sends him slipping into Glove World!. Patrick sleep-walks on the tracks of the Neck Breaker roller coaster ride. SpongeBob flags down a roller coaster car, hops inside and follows Patrick through the tracks.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob reaches out to grab Patrick. The car goes through the loop-de-loop and Patrick falls off his pants.]
Patrick: Breezy.
[Patrick falls back into his pants. SpongeBob falls off the car and holds onto Patrick. Patrick slides up to the top of the track. And after a few seconds, Patrick descends downward while SpongeBob screams at the top of his lungs. Patrick flies off the track and lands directly near his house. SpongeBob pulls himself together and sends Patrick back to his house. Patrick steps on a pebble.]
Patrick: Ow! [strains]
SpongeBob: Oh, brother. [falls asleep as he is completely tired from having such an eventful night]
Patrick: [Notices SpongeBob is now sleepwalking] Oh!
[SpongeBob sleep-walks into the street.]
Patrick: Oh, he'll be fine.
[Patrick jumps on his rock and goes back to sleep. As Patrick closes his rock, crashing noises are heard as SpongeBob is getting run over by the boats, ending the episode.]
