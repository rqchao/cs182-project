[pan over live-action houses]
French Narrator: We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.. flipping burgers?!
Patchy: Hey, kids! Potty and I took jobs flipping burgers so we could be just like our hero...SpongeBob SquarePants!
Potty: I took the job for the free sodas.
Patchy: Potty, don't you have dishes to wash?
Mr. Pirateson: Argh!
Patchy: Oh, hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.
Mr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrgh! [gives Patchy a piece of paper]
Patchy: [Reads] One order of Scurvy Fries, one large Bilge Water.
Mr. Pirateson: Argh! Arrrgh!
Patchy: Uh, Diet Bilge Water. I'll get right on it sir. [Patchy salutes, his spatula (which replaces his hook) impacting his forehead. He squirms in pain] Ahhhhh!
[Cut to next scene]
Potty: P.U.! What died in there?
Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new Pirate Patties! I call this one "Buried Treasure". [reveals a treasure chest on a hamburger]
Potty: Where'd you dig that one up?
Patchy: I call this one "Walk the Plank". [reveals a wooden board on a hamburger]
Potty: I'm already "board" with that one.
Patchy: This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The "Patchy Patty"! [reveals a patty on a burger with a pickle for an eye, an eye patch, a mustard mouth, a beard around the patty, and lettuce underneath.]
Patchy Patty: Ahoy!
Potty: Aw, that's the worst one yet.
Patchy: Potty Parrot, you are never supportive of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!
Potty: Brawk, Patchy, no! [Patchy cries and runs to another room] Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Squawk!
Patchy: You know, this isn't the first time that a patty's come between two good chums. It happened once in Bikini Bottom. Here, take a look while I...[sniffs]...pull myself together. [continues crying. Episode starts]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, something ain't right. 
[A two-tiered pink birthday cake on a cart rolls in. The icing reads "Happy Birthday Krabs"]
Mr. Krabs: For me?
Squidward: Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Mr. Krabs: Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. 
[Mr. Krabs is about to blow out the candle when Plankton pops out from underneath the candle]
Plankton: Surprise!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream. Plankton, smiling deviously, takes out the candle and uses it to release the balloons. Like dynamite, the balloon strings burn up and the balloons pop as confetti goes everywhere. The light from the popping blinds the customers as confetti gets into their eyes. Plankton's cart engages in its jet pack and launches itself into the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Duck!
Plankton: Disengage!
[Plankton releases the bottom part of the cake onto the safe in the kitchen. Plankton lands the upper cake part onto the floor and hits a button on the control panel. The cake explodes, causing icing to go onto SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Squidward's faces. Plankton takes the formula and flies out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula!
Plankton: Happy Birthday, Krabs!
SpongeBob: Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. [squirts Plankton's ship on the windshield with ketchup and mustard]
Mr. Krabs: Attaboy, SpongeBob! [turns the ceiling fan on. Plankton's machine bounces off of it and breaks to pieces on the floor. SpongeBob snatches the secret formula with his tongue and swallows it]
SpongeBob: Safe!
Plankton: You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back. [activates his jet pack, but he realizes it's upside down] Oh, barnacles. [He flies into the floor. Everyone is groaning and moaning from the ordeal.]
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? Why does he hate us so?! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might as well blame me, SpongeBob. [sits on a barrel seat] There was a time when Plankton and I...were...best friends. [everyone gasps and runs up to hear the story]
SpongeBob: Best friends?
Mr. Krabs: Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones...
[Mr. Krabs began to recall himself and Plankton as babies, which was the time they were born.]
Baby Plankton: Goo. [Baby Krabs laughs, then he puts Plankton on the mobile hanging above him.]
Everyone: Aw!
[Cut to flashback of Krabs and Plankton's third birthday. There's a birthday cake reading "Big Boys". Toddler Krabs inhales, then sticks out his tongue to get Plankton to blow out the candles]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating]...things were all peaches and cream... [Plankton blows out the candles, then dives off his tongue into the cake as if jumping off a diving board into a swimming pool. Bubble transition to elementary school, after passing years]...until we hit grade school.
[In a classroom, kids are in science class, chattering and doing chemistry as the teacher reads at his desk. Krabs, as a kid, is writing on paper as Plankton, also a kid, holds up two test tubes in his gloved hands.]
Young Eugene: Hey, Planky. What'cha doing?
Kid Plankton: Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out. [a spitball hits Plankton in the back of his head. The classmates laugh] Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. [muffled explosion. Plankton's container blows up all over his table and covers him in ashes. Classmates laugh. Billy, the ringleader of the hooligans, grabs him]
Billy: How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? [He stuffs Plankton into his straw and blows him out like a spitball. He splatters into Mr. Krabs's eye.]
Kid Plankton: [moaning in pain] They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [peeling off squished Plankton] Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
Billy: [feigning guilt] You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. [back to mean and cruel bully mode] Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy. [bullies laugh]
Classmate #2: Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping, the trash can? [the class laughs again. Krabs is on the verge of breaking down into tears.]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash. [flashback ends] You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... [sniffles]....fashion me clothes from rags.
[flashback to Krabs' mother sewing up clothes]
Mama Krabs: There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
Old Man Jenkins: Oops. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes and uses it as a rag to dry his boat] I missed a spot.
[Krabs and Plankton are walking through the carnival grounds, with Plankton conversing with him. Krabs has a box around his body]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] Then one day, as Plankton and I plotted our revenge, I met the love of me life.
Kid Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is that? [picks up a penny off the ground] It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!
Kid Plankton: It's money.
Mr. Krabs: Moneyyyyyyyyyy?
Plankton: Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Kid Mr. Krabs: Buy things?
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. [Mr. Krabs buys a balloon for Plankton, but when he gives it to Plankton, he flies up into the sky because of his weight. Krabs reaches up, looking desperate]
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea what that went through to get here.
Mr. Krabs: I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. [shoves it away with a pencil]
SWAT Fish #4: So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
Squidward: Yeah. I really wanna know.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers". It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky. [a group of kid regulars (Billy and his gang) run up clamoring] And Stinky loved the kids.
Stinky: Now, what can I do for you, young 'uns?
Billy: Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one burger, please!
Bully #3: Me, too, Stinky!
Stinky: Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. [they all cheer]
Big Johnny: That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.
Bully #5: We don't like Stinky, we respect him.
Stinky: Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like or respect me?
Big Johnny: Like!
Bully #5: Respect!
Big Johnny: Like!
Bully #5: Respect!
Stinky: Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. [they cheer again]
Mr. Krabs: Excuse us!
Plankton: Valuable customers coming through.
Big Johnny (in Billy's voice): What are those dorks doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Stinky: [Stinky makes weird faces] Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
All: Yeah, Stinky!
Billy: Thanks for keeping the nerds out.
Bully #2: You're the best, Stinky.
Stinky: Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy. [Mr. Krabs is knocking on the door in the back of the building. Stinky opens up the door, he makes weird faces again] Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li... [his watch beeps] Is it quitting time already? [rips off his clothes to reveal some nicer clothes underneath] Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. [gets in his limo and moves the stack of cash over on the seat. As he closes the door and drives off, a dollar flies into Mr. Krabs' hand]
Plankton: Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipping burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Mr. Krabs: Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if someone made a better burger, they'd have a fatter stack of loot. [cash register dings as Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bill signs] But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
Plankton: Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! [laughs. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met. [Patchy shows a picture of him as a young pirate, holding Potty's egg in his hands] If I could only hear his voice.
Potty: Less talking and more working.
Patchy: [gasps] Potty! You came back to apologize!
Potty: I came to tell you to get back to work!
Patchy: Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?
Potty: Oh, a little thing called the G.E.D., my man.
Patchy: Oh, here we go again with the fancy book-learnin'. Customers love me cookin'. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.
[Customer throws up the food into a doggy bag and the customer's face turns green]
Patchy: Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?
Potty: You just need some practice, that's all.
[Patchy flips burgers and stuff, then we see Patchy looking through a microscope. He sees mini burger bacteria cells, then he laughs and coughs]
Patchy: Ahh, me patty's done.
Potty: Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!
Patchy: Oh, fine. I'll eat it! [Patchy eats it and then smiles, frowns and spits it out] Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank! [Patchy watches as the burger on a string jumps of the plank into the trash] Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.
Potty: Brawk, roll film. [SpongeBob is shown as a baby and he makes a Krabby Patty perfectly] A perfect patty on the first try.
Patchy: Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!
Potty: You're unsanitary, Patchy. You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!
Patchy: Well, that's what gives it its special flavor. [Patchy puts a small piece of hamburger meat on top and sparkles]
Potty: You've got rats in the kitchen!
Patchy: Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess? [Rat bites him] Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!
Potty: And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.
Patchy: What? Every time?
Potty: That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.
Patchy: What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?
Potty: The same kind who wears a "Kiss the Cook" apron.
Patchy: Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh? [Patchy winks four times]
Potty: Now I feel sick.
Patchy: That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!
[Patchy starts flipping patties at Potty]
Potty: Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?
[when Potty flies away, Patchy flips one in Mr. Pirateson's face]
Potty: Now you've done it.
Mr. Pirateson: [He removes the patty from his face] Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy: Yes, Mr. Pirateson. [Potty flies into his office] You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.
Mr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy: Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.
[cut to Mr. Krabs and Plankton walking by the dump]
Mr. Krabs: So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton work together to make a burger and go through the steps of doing so]
Plankton: Gently. Gently. [holds up the burger on a platter]
Mr. Krabs: We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kids' greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton turn a trailer in the dump into a restaurant. Mr. Krabs cuts the 'grand opening' tape while Plankton pushes a button to signal for customers. A line of customers line up in front of the restaurant] Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. [the kid gives his dollar for a burger]
Plankton: There you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs: 'Twas me first dollar I ever earned, and 'twas also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
Fish Kid: Hey! Your burgers are even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.
Plankton: Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
Mr. Krabs: I thought it was our recipe.
Plankton: I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: But what about satisfying the customer?
Plankton: Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world! [laughs again] And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Mr. Krabs: Give me that!
Plankton: Stop! You're gonna bust it! [the recipe tears in half]
Mr. Krabs: Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Plankton: I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Mr. Krabs: Which one? The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?
Plankton: Oh, either one will do.
Mr. Krabs: What I was saying was... [Plankton pulls a string that launches Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant] YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!! [Mr. Krabs lands in the trash. Back to present] And he always did.
Plankton: [pops out of the pepper shaker] Lies! [SpongeBob is about to swallow the formula again, but Mr Krabs takes it and puts it in his back pocket]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Plankton: Very touching, but completely false.
Mr. Krabs: Don't know what you mean.
Plankton: Why don't you tell them the truth?
SpongeBob: It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton: Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. [flashback again to restaurant. Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: First, I'll rule their stomachs and then... [laughs] ...their money! [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Plankton: But what about satisfying the customers?
Mr. Krabs: Barnacles to the customers! [Plankton gasps] I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Plankton: Gimme that! [both try to take the formula]
Mr. Krabs: Stop, you're gonna bust it. [formula tears in half]
Plankton: This isn't about money, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Malarkey. [Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in a straw and spits him out]
Plankton: YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!! [lands in a pile of trash] Ouch. [emerges and looks at the half of his recipe] [offscreen, narrating] Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
Karen: That's because it isn't.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, &amp; Plankton: KAREN?!
Karen: You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.
Plankton: It was only our third date.
Karen: Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. [flashback on Karen's computer screen]
Plankton: Now that's a handsome looking burger.
Mr. Krabs: You said it, old chum. [over intercom] Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here! [a tumbleweed rolls by] Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? [music is playing in the background]
Plankton: What's that music?
Mr. Krabs: I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins puts a tire in his boat]
Old Man Jenkins: I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
Mr. Krabs: You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
Old Man Jenkins: Why, I'd be happy to! [bites into the burger then smiles]
Mr. Krabs &amp; Plankton: Yeah! [Old Man Jenkins falls over. Later, a newspaper appears on screen]
Mr. Krabs: "Plab Patties KO Old Man J". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
Plankton: Well, he is old.
Mr. Krabs: Hey. That guy is like family to me.
Plankton: Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
Mr. Krabs: You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger. (The Subtitles in Netflix reads "You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in".)
Plankton: You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Mr. Krabs: No way, that recipe's mine! [both fight over the recipe]
Plankton: Stop, you're gonna... [recipe tears in half, sending both into opposite sides of the restaurant. Plankton walks out] You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! [slams the door, causing a shelf above the boiling patty meat to spill the jars into the cauldron]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything. [licks some of the patty mix] I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. [Plankton puts a Chum Bucket bucket with meat in it while Mr. Krabs wheels in "Krabby Patties" and knocks him over]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
Plankton: I think not, Rag Boy!
Mr. Krabs: What?! Why I oughta squash you right now! You little...
Plankton: Get out of my face! [both growl at each other]
Bully #3: Hey, look! Nerd fight.
Billy: I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.
Plankton: Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Billy: Big Johnny will eat anything. [Big Johnny walks over to Plankton's side]
Plankton: Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. [Johnny eats it]
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.
Plankton: Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! [Big Johnny spits the burger out on both his friends]
Billy: I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.
Mr. Krabs: Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. [hands him a patty. He takes a bite and instantly enjoys it]
Billy: Flavor!
Bully #5: Edible!
Bullies #2 and #6: We can actually hold it down!
Abigail-Marge: This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!
All: Yay, Rag Boy!
Plankton: I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do! [flashback ends]
Mr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!
Plankton: You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!
Mr. Krabs: You callin' me a liar?
Karen: Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship! [both tear up]
Mr. Krabs: You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Plankton: My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
Plankton: It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
Mr. Krabs: I'd like that, Planky, old chum. [both hug and cry]
SpongeBob: Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
Karen: I suppose it would. If I had one.
Plankton: I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Mr. Krabs: Me, too. Me, too. [Plankton grabs the formula from Mr. Krabs' back pocket]
Plankton: Now, Karen! [Karen grabs the formula] Back off, Rag Boy! [jumps on the formula and Karen wheels off]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Sabotage!
Plankton: Go, Karen! [everyone chases each other outside. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading. [He holds up a newspaper that reads the word JOBS on the front]
Potty: Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!
Patchy: Hey, you got fired, too!
Potty: I got a golden parachute.
[A golden parachute appears on Potty's strings. The inside of the restaurant glows]
Patchy: Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.
Potty: [squawk] Looks like they already did.
[Patchy gasps when he sees a gorilla]
Patchy: What!? They let a smelly, hairy fleabag like that serve food?
Gorilla: [enraged] Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!
Patchy: Hey, watch it, ape!
[Gorilla throws some food ingredients at Patchy]
Patchy: Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!
Gorilla: Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!
Patchy: Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!
Narrator: And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed.
