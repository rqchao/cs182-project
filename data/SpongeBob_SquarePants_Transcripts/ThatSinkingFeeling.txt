[The episode opens with SpongeBob and Patrick playing in Squidward's yard and annoying him.]
Squidward: Stop playing... in my yard!
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway.
Patrick: No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce.
Squidward: Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play in... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob! [sobs] I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!
Squidward: I choose Patrick... [carries Patrick to his yard] to play in Patrick's yard... [carries SpongeBob to his yard] and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody... [draws a rectangle around his house] in here! [leaves]
Patrick: SpongeBob! [attempts to run around]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [does the same over and over]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick! [reaches road. He gasps] The road! [attempts to cross road but there's too much traffic] Patrick! What are we gonna do?
Patrick: I'll mail myself to your house! [climbs in the mailbox, mailbox tips over and explodes]
SpongeBob: Sit tight, Patrick! I'm coming to get you! [ties his hands around the mailbox and flings himself to Patrick] No!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. [flings back to his house] Patrick! Call me!
Patrick: Okay! [both go back to their houses and Patrick calls]
SpongeBob: [phone rings] SquarePants residence.
Patrick: What are we gonna do?!
SpongeBob: Hmmmm... have we ever dug a tunnel between our two houses?
Patrick: No. [both put on digging gear and start digging tunnels underground, the tunnel says: "Eat at the Krusty Krab." Patrick sticks his head through a hole and reaches SpongeBob] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Both: We did it!
SpongeBob: Tag! You're it! [Patrick runs through the hole. They both start playing tag]
Patrick: Tag! You're it!
SpongeBob: Tag! You're it!
Patrick: Tag! You're it!
[Back on the surface, Squidward is napping on his couch.]
SpongeBob: Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Patrick: [laughs]
[Squidward wakes up, fluffs his pillow and goes back to sleep.]
SpongeBob: You're it!
Patrick: You're it! [both laugh]
Squidward: [rips pillow with his head and gets some Jello] Must... block... out... noise! [puts jello on his head and sits down]
Patrick: Knock, knock!
SpongeBob: Who's there?
Patrick: I don't know! [both laugh]
Squidward: [gets angry and the jello melts off his  head. He goes outside] I thought I told you two to stay off my... [the yard is empty] yard. [hears a laugh coming from Patrick's rock] Patrick! [opens the rock] Patrick, would you shut...? [finds the rock empty] Where is he? [hears a laugh from SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob. [opens door] SpongeBob! [hears another laugh] SpongeBob, I am trying to... [opens the kitchen door] sleep? [hears another laugh. Heads upstairs. He opens the bathroom door. He opens SpongeBob's bedroom door. He opens the roof door] Aha! [sees Gary] Hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Where are those two morons? [flowers giggle and uproots them. He hears more laughter and becomes scared out of his wits. He then stomps on the ground] Where are they?!
SpongeBob: [laughing] Ohh... Patrick, check out these roots!
Patrick: They're dancing!
SpongeBob: Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance, baby! [does a dance that causes the ground to shake, Squidward's house sinks]
Patrick: Squidward's house wants to play too!
Squidward: My house! [climbs through the roof hatch and grumbles angrily]
SpongeBob: Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy.
Patrick: Must've been something it ate. [Squidward comes out door]
SpongeBob: It ate Squidward!
Patrick: [mumbles] That'll do it.
Squidward: [sighs] I knew you two reprobates were behind this.
SpongeBob: Yeah! We're reprobates!
Squidward: That was an insult.
Patrick: And we're insulted!
Squidward: Why were you digging under my yard?
SpongeBob: You told us not to walk on your yard, so we walked under it.
Squidward: But you buried my house!
Patrick: No need to thank us.
Squidward: Thank you?!
Patrick: You're welcome.
Squidward: [screams and attempts to get Patrick, but he runs away]
Patrick: Missed.
SpongeBob: Somebody wants to play Tag!
Patrick: Tag! You're it! [runs]
SpongeBob: Not it!
Squidward: [growls and chases them]
Patrick: Whee!
SpongeBob: [Squidward grabs them and drags them back] Squidward wins!
Squidward: Now, you're gonna play a new game called, "Digging Out my House!"
SpongeBob: Oh boy! [SpongeBob and Patrick grab some gear]
Squidward: And I'm gonna play "Sit and Relax" until you're finished. [closes door] Barnacle brains. [sits down. Patrick breaks window and throws dirt. SpongeBob knocks on the roof and it collapses and blocks Squidward's door] SpongeBob! [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward [dirt comes rushing through the house and the window]
Squidward: [growls]
SpongeBob: Yuh oh!
Squidward: I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree- [raises hand but only raises two so he uses his nose] Three. I am going to grind you into chum! One!
Patrick: [screams] He's counting, anything but counting! [he and SpongeBob dig] Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!!!
Squidward: Two!
Patrick: [he and SpongeBob stop digging] He's already at number two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?!
Squidward: Th-ree!
Patrick: [gasps]
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream. They start digging very fast while Squidward is chasing them, grumbling angrily. Many buildings above ground collapse because of the digging. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab being sunk.]
Plankton: Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town! [the Chum Bucket sinks underground] Nuts.
SpongeBob: [scene cuts to the chase. SpongeBob and Patrick are stopped because of a rock in the way] Must dig! Ohhh! The rock's too hard! [Squidward comes towards them as they scream and panic]
Squidward: [gasping and breathing] You... two... morons... sunk my house!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [crying] We're sorry!
Squidward: I'm gonna- [rumble noise] Uh, oh. [the ground shakes and whole city falls underground]
SpongeBob: [cuts to next day] Ahhhh. [whole town digging] Good morning, Squidward! Another beautiful day under Bikini Bottom!
Squidward: [picks up gear] I hate neighbors.
