[The episode begins on a stormy night in Bikini Bottom. Above the city, two clouds come to life as the sun rises.]
Cloud father: [yawns and looks at his watch] Whoa. [wakes up his cloud wife] Hmm. [points to their next destination]
Cloud mother: Oh!
[The two clouds float away, but they accidentally left a small baby cloud behind. The baby cloud wakes up from its slumber.]
Drizzle: Huh? [whimpers and sees neither of his parents] Ma? Pa? [cries a small rainfall over the town]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler with the big weather! Well, just as I predicted, those severe thunderstorms are moving to the southeast, and I guarantee it's gonna be nothing but sunny skies for the rest of the week. [takes off his raincoat to reveal his summer attire] This is Gale Doppler, and I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong! [reveals to be on TV] Heh, heh.
SpongeBob: [running on the treadmill] Huh? [gets tangled up in the treadmill] Whoa-boing! [crashes into the wall] Hah! Sunny skies all week? [his eyes become yellow like the sun] Hot diggity! [runs to the window, but to his surprise, he sees rain falling; his eyes then turn black] Rain. [grabs a photo of Gale Doppler] But-but Gale Doppler is never wrong. Huh? Hm.
[SpongeBob runs outside to check to see if it is raining.]
SpongeBob: [mumbles] What...? [sees a waterfall of rain] Hm? [looks up and sees the baby cloud crying] Aw, it's a little baby storm cloud. Hello, little cloud. Nice to meet you.
Drizzle: [crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're crying. I thought you were raining.
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind one of the pineapple's leaves]
SpongeBob: Oh, now don't be scared. SpongeBob knows just what a growing storm cloud needs. [brings in a pot of steaming hot water] Hot steam. [kisses, sets the pot down and goes back into his house]
[The baby cloud comes out from the leaves on the roof and slurps down the hot water. SpongeBob watches the cloud in the water from inside his house. He comes back out through the front door.]
Drizzle: Huh? [hides behind the house]
SpongeBob: Well, okay, I don't see any clouds, so I'm just gonna take a walk.
Drizzle: Huh?
SpongeBob: [whistles as the baby cloud casts a shadow over him] Tut-tut, it looks like rain. Hah! [the baby cloud disappears before reappearing in front of him] Oh, hello there. [the baby cloud licks SpongeBob like a dog] Aw, who's a cute cumulous? [hugs the baby cloud] I always wanted to have a pet cloud formation. I gonna name you... [gets sprayed in the face by the baby cloud; gasps] Drizzle. [giggles as Drizzle floats around him  and plays with him]
[Drizzle picks up SpongeBob and shows the viewing of Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Hey, good visibility!
[Drizzle absorbs SpongeBob into his cloud body and rains him down to the ground. SpongeBob laughs and Drizzle blows a gust of wind in his face. Drizzle's wind causes SpongeBob to lose his pants.]
SpongeBob: [imitating Gale Doppler] And gusty winds from the southeast.
[SpongeBob and Drizzle laugh. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Drizzle playing in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob is laying on the ground and Drizzle is forming shapes for SpongeBob to guess. Drizzle forms into a boat.]
SpongeBob: Um. A clam eating a telephone.
[Drizzle forms into something off-screen.]
SpongeBob: A fur chandelier!
[Drizzle forms into a boot.]
SpongeBob: A lamp!
[Drizzle forms into a treasure chest.]
SpongeBob: A shoe factory!
[Drizzle forms into a globe.]
SpongeBob: A continental breakfast!
Drizzle: Ooh. [forms into a dog]
SpongeBob: A chicken!
Drizzle: [moves its mouth but clucks like a chicken instead of barking like a dog]
SpongeBob: Oh, I am so good at this.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking Drizzle for a walk. They both stop at a fire hydrant and run into a civilian who is walking his worm. Both Drizzle and the worm snarl at each other. The worm barks ferociously. But Drizzle lets out a blast of cold ice from his mouth, freezing the worm and its owner.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. Ee...
[SpongeBob and Drizzle continue walking as the civilian and his worm crumble into ice particles.]
SpongeBob: Bad Drizzle. Bad. [Drizzle nuzzles up against SpongeBob] Well, all right, not that bad. Okay, let's go home. [hops on Drizzle's back and rides home]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob tying Drizzle to a pole outside his house.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Drizzle, but you can't go in the house until you're housebroken.
[Gary is looking out the bedroom window and is all wet from Drizzle's rain.]
Gary: [closes the blinds] Meow.
SpongeBob: I'll check on you later. [goes back into the house]
[Drizzle struggles to break free from the pole, but it is no use. So, it creates thunderbolts and burns the pole to a crisp.]
Drizzle: Whoo-hoo! [flies away]
SpongeBob: It's later! [holds out a bowl of hot water] Who wants a steaming hot bowl of steam? [sees Drizzle gone] Ah! Drizzle! [the bowl of hot water falls on his head] Yow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Where art thou, Drizzle? Oh, what unfortunate forecast be this? [sees Drizzle flying away, crying] Oh, wait. There he goes. Come back, Drizzle! Come back! [follows Drizzle]
[Drizzle is in the middle of Bikini Bottom's intersection, dodging incoming boats left and right.]
Drizzle: Whoa!
Mary: Oh, get off the road!
[A truck hits Drizzle and sends him spinning. Another truck sends Drizzle spinning into a random pet store. When he comes out from the pet store, he turned gray and rained snails and worms similar to the phrase "raining cats and dogs." The citizens run in panic as snails and worms fall on them.]
Nat Peterson: [covered in snails and worms] It's raining snails and worms! [trips over Gale Doppler and runs off]
Gale Doppler: [takes off his sunglasses and pulls out his microphone] That's impossible! I called for sunny skies and for 35 years I broadcast the forecast that's never wrong. [snails and worms fall on him]
[The snail and worm begin fighting each other and Gale is getting pummeled by them. Nat comes back and takes the microphone.]
Nat Peterson: This just in: Gale Doppler is wrong! [removes a worm from his head and puts it on Gale's head before leaving]
Gale Doppler: [laughs awkwardly] Huh? [turns and sees Drizzle causing mayhem in town]
[Drizzle is zapping thunderbolts at everyone and blows them all around.]
Gale Doppler: [rips off his summer attire] Ah! I see the trouble now, folks. That is what they call an unpredictable storm front. [Drizzle turns back to normal and flies away] But don't worry. [pulls out a leaf blower and turns it to suck] I'm gonna suck him right out of the sky to save my reputation, after these messages.
Debbie Rechid: Are you constipated? Sure, we all are. [holds up a plunger contraption] Thank goodness there's newâ€”
SpongeBob: [interrupts the commercial] Drizzle! Drizzle, where are you? Excuse me. Have you seen a little storm cloud about yea big?
[Drizzle continues running around town and tries to hide from Gale Doppler. Drizzle hide behind a billboard, hoping that Gale would never find him. However, Gale finds him and sucks him in his leaf blower.]
Gale Doppler: I got him! Naughty nimbus, nobody messes with my flawless forecasts. It's back to sunny skies for Bikini Bottom. [prepares to blast Drizzle away, but SpongeBob passes by]
SpongeBob: Drizzle! Drizzle! Drizzle! [finds Drizzle in Gale's leaf blower] Oh, there you are, Drizzle. [gasps] Gale Doppler! [shakes his hand] You're my favorite well-eyed weather man! Oh, thanks for finding my lost pet, Mr. Doppler. Time to go home, Drizzle.
Gale Doppler: I'm sorry, square face. This cloud is a danger to the public. And I'm sending him straight to cloud heaven. [turns on the leaf blower and blows Drizzle away, but sucks him back; he laughs] I'm Gale Doppler, and I control the weather. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, Doppler. [appears to have his own leaf blower] You're not the only one who knows how to use a leaf blower, sucker. [turns on his leaf blower and sucks Drizzle out of Gale's]
[SpongeBob and Gale go out on a little tug of war with Drizzle using their leaf blowers. Just then, a kid comes in. SpongeBob gives the kid his leaf blower and takes Drizzle. SpongeBob runs to a corner to hide from Gale. SpongeBob then disguises Drizzle as a wig so they could fool Gale as he runs by. But that didn't fool him at all. He sees through SpongeBob's disguise and prepares to suck Drizzle. But SpongeBob activates his leaf blower inside Drizzle and blows away.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Drizzle. We put a stoppler to the doppler. And I predict sunny skies for the rest of our lives.
[Drizzle gets pulled away by something and SpongeBob falls into a mailbox in the street.]
Drizzle: Huh?
[Drizzle is being sucked by an even bigger leaf blower attached to a construction machine operated by Gale Doppler.]
Gale Doppler: Ooh! That's a nasty low pressure system from the north!
[SpongeBob comes out of the mailbox and coughs up random letters and a package. Drizzle cries out for help as he is being sucked in the machine even further. SpongeBob runs over to Gale Doppler and falls to his knees.]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Doppler, don't send Drizzle to cloud heaven!
Gale Doppler: That's just an expression. He's not going anywhere.
SpongeBob: Phew, that's a relief.
Gale Doppler: [moves the machine over the dehumidifier] I'm gonna drop him in this dehumidifier and dissolve him.
Drizzle: [screams]
SpongeBob: Dissolve him?! What?! [hops onto Gale's head and holds his eyes shut] Please, Mr. Doppler! Drizzle's a good cloud! He doesn't deserve to dissolve! [cries a fountain of tears]
Gale Doppler: I've got zero visibility. Let go of my eyes, square face!
[SpongeBob's tears fall onto Drizzle into the sucker.]
SpongeBob: [sobs] Drizzle!
[Suddenly, SpongeBob's tears cause Drizzle to grow bigger and turn gray. Drizzle's growth destroys the sucker. Gale finally gets to remove SpongeBob off his face. He turns around and sees Drizzle forming thunderbolts and blowing winds. SpongeBob gets up and nervously runs away, sensing that Gale made him mad.]
Gale Doppler: I'm in the middle of a severe thunderstormâ€”[gets hit by a stop sign] And we're bringing it to you liâ€”
[Drizzle blows the microphone into his cloud body. Drizzle zaps Gale and flies right in his mouth and into his body. Gale is lifted in the air and he coughs up the microphone.]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I actually am the weather! [laughs, but thunder rumbles in his body and rain falls; it appears that Drizzle is now taking control of Gale's body and is making him do what he what him to do] Huh? Uh-oh.
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [pulls his right leg and makes an umbrella]
[Drizzle floats Gale back into town and makes him blow wind everywhere. Drizzle then makes Gale's body freeze.]
Gale Doppler: [shivering] My body is cold!
[Drizzle makes Gale create a blanket of snow over the town.]
Gale Doppler: I don't want to be the weather anymore. It hurts! [Drizzle produces thunder and lightning in Gale's body, making him wail in pain]
SpongeBob: [comes out through the roof of one of the buildings] Excuse me, Drizzle. I don't mean to parade on your rain, but could you please put Gale down?
[A gust of wind blows SpongeBob into the sky.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [screams and lands on top of a bigger storm cloud; he gets up and sees two bigger storm clouds] Huh? Oh, no! Not more storm clouds.
Gale Doppler: [as Drizzle makes him fly around] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[The two bigger storm clouds create a loud thunder to get Drizzle to stop.]
Gale Doppler: No!
[Drizzle turns Gale around and comes out from his mouth.]
Drizzle: What? [sees his cloud parents and laughs] Aw. [flies over to his cloud parents and hugs them]
SpongeBob: Holy hurricane, they're Drizzle's parents!
Cloud father: [pats Drizzle on the head] Mm, mm. [mutters sternly to not stay behind again and looks down to see Gale] Hmm? [his thunder rumbles]
[Gale is dangling on Drizzle. He takes out his microphone.]
Gale Doppler: You know, everybody complains about the weather, but my next guests actually do something about it. Did you two always want to be storm clouds?
[Gale points the microphone at Drizzle's cloud parents. They were not very happy for the way Gale treated their son.]
Cloud mother and Cloud father: [inhales and blows Gale away]
Gale Doppler: I'm Gale Doppler, and I could probably use an ambulance, [gets blown off into the distance] right about now! [lands in the dehumidifier, which causes it to explode]
[The sun begins the rise and the cloud family start to leave for their next destination.]
SpongeBob: Good-bye, my little foul weather friend. I'll never forget you, come rain or shine. [blow kisses]
Drizzle: Huh? [turns back and gives SpongeBob a smaller storm cloud as a token of appreciation for his kindness]
SpongeBob: Aw, thank you, Drizzle. Don't worry, I'll water him and walk him every day.
Drizzle: [waves good-bye and goes to rejoin his cloud parents] Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Bye! [looks at the smaller storm cloud] Aw, I'm gonna name you Drizzle Jr. [Drizzle Jr. licks him like a dog just like his father, Drizzle did earlier in the episode] And I know just where to keep you too.
Everyone: Aww!
Gale Doppler: [reveals to have survived the explosion and is completely burned] Aww. [groans]
[The scene changes back to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is preparing to start the day as usual and is going to take a shower. He opens the shower curtains and climbs into the tub.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Drizzle Jr. Not too hot but not too cold.
Drizzle Jr.: Uh-huh. [produces rain for SpongeBob to shower]
[SpongeBob sings in opera while washing himself, ending the episode.]
