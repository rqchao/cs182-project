Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [antenna on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: [his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
Patrick: I want an award! [starts to cry]
SpongeBob: [has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry. [Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards] You'll get an award one day.
Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
SpongeBob: But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
SpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Patrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks]
Patrick: Doctor?
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks more]
Patrick: Fireman?
SpongeBob: [In a tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
Patrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
Patrick: Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]
Patrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
SpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
Squidward: Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
Patrick: Do I get my award yet?
SpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?
Patrick: Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
Patrick: Do I get my award, now?
SpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
Patrick: Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food; Patrick burps]
SpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
Patrick: Like that?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick: [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: Let's try something different.
SpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.
Patrick: Aye aye, Captain! [phone rings]
Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling; phone rings again]
Girl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [annoyed] No, this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle; phone rings yet again]
Another Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [angry] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down and folds his arms] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
Patrick: Huh? Oh...Fishpaste!
SpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
Patrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.
SpongeBob: You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the handle side of the broom instead of the head]
Nat: [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
SpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick.
Delivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
Patrick: Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the head of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]
SpongeBob: [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
Patrick: [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never gonna get an award, now.
SpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle.
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: You need a jar. [Patrick picks up a spatula] No. [Patrick takes his pants off] No. [Patrick picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him "the lid", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
SpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!
SpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
Patrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
SpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?
SpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.
Patrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.
SpongeBob: Forget my hat.
Patrick: Uh, me, too.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
Patrick: Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!
SpongeBob: Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Why are you doing that?
Patrick: So I can win an award like you.
SpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
Patrick: Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
SpongeBob: Say, you're good.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickle fish lips! [both cover their mouths] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
SpongeBob: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
Patrick: There's no award for that!
Squidward: [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Patrick: Until I have as many awards as you.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
Patrick: No, we won't.
SpongeBob: [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. [crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope] Ha! Not a scratch on me. [body breaks down into pieces]
Patrick: Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads]
SpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head]
Patrick: My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
SpongeBob: [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
Patrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick...
Patrick: Patrick's not here!
Delivery Guy: [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Another trophy?
Patrick: [sarcastically] Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for THIS time?
SpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
Patrick: Yay! [puts trophy on his head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits]
SpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?
Patrick: I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]
Narrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.
