[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping Krabby Patties as he dances to the music on the radio.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah! [shakes his butt to the music] Oh, oh! [blows a raspberry, takes off his hat and rolls a stack of patties on the grill] Oh! [shakes his butt again, dances for a bit and grills the patty with his nose] Ooh! [smoke goes up the chimney and SpongeBob makes a perfect patty] Oh! [the patty bounces on his butt while dancing to the music]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need— [sees SpongeBob dancing] Whoa. Sponge—
[SpongeBob screams as Squidward's holler startled him. The patty flies into Squidward's face and gets sucked into the chimney.]
SpongeBob: Patty, no! [climbs on Squidward and goes to reach the patty] Oh, I can't quite reach it.
[Squidward is wailing in agonizing pain as his face gets burnt on the grill. He pushes SpongeBob and pulls himself of the grill's surface. What remains of his face are bare muscles and a large nose bone. He grumbles as he grabs his original face. Suddenly, smoke fills up the entire restaurant. The customers run outside flopping around and gasping for air.]
Mr. Krabs: [coughs] Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights. [giggles as Mr. Krabs pushes him to the ladder. He climbs up the ladder and reaches the rooftop] Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept. [giggles and extends his arm to make it long enough for him to reach. He reaches his arm down the chimney and grabs the patty] There you are! [reels his arm back up and the patty is dirty from the smoke. He blows on it and rubs the smoke off] Good as new! [turns to climb back down, but a drop of ketchup splatters and he slips on it. He sees the patty fall and grabs it before it falls. The crowd below gasps and the patty begins to slip; gasps] Hold on, patty! I've got you! [struggles to hold onto the patty, but it slips off his hand] No!
[The patty falls to the ground, splattering ketchup all over the everyone's faces. The patty is ruined and the customers cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, SpongeBob. Time to come back down and get to work so I can garnish your wages for wasting that patty!
[SpongeBob looks down at the ground and imagines that the height of the Krusty Krab is much higher than it really is. He hallucinates and then falls back down to the actual Krusty Krab roof. He then grips the roof in further fear.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, boy-o. Just climb on down!
SpongeBob: [yelping dizzily as he clings on the chimney] No, I'm good! [groans loudly]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I order you to come down here immediately!
Sandy: Don't worry, I'll get him down with my newest invention: Extend-O-Boots. I just press this button, and... [pushes the button on her suit and her boots extend her very high] Whoa! [she reaches the surface] Sorry, I haven't worked out all the kinks yet! [she clumsily tries to walk with her extended legs] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa-oh-oh! [the customers fled as Squidward sleepily walks out the doors] Whoa!
Squidward: What the—[gets kicked by Sandy's Extend-O-Boots and is sent flying out in the distance before exploding on impact]
Mr. Krabs: So, uh... anybody else got an idea?
Patrick: It's okay, I got him! [Throws in a duck-float, then bounces on it. He falls onto a plank of the roof that tosses SpongeBob upwards, but SpongeBob fell right down back to where he was. SpongeBob wraps his arms around the chimney] Hey, SpongeBob. Whatcha doing wa-a-ay up here? [shows the Krusty Krab exaggeratedly taller than it really is] Let's climb down now. [pulls SpongeBob, but SpongeBob but struggles to hold onto the chimney]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead. [springs back to the chimney] I just can't do it. It's too far down! [sobbing]
Patrick: Aw, don't worry, SpongeBob. Your old pal Patrick has another plan to get you off this roof.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Sure. Just do what I do. [winks] Hm... [walks off the roof but falls down to the ground, smashing a hole in the ground] Ow!
SpongeBob: Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am. [comes back to the roof and hyperventilates]
[The customers become annoyed and frustrated at SpongeBob's dilemma and walk off. The scene changes to nighttime.]
SpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here.
[SpongeBob looks out from the roof and sees his house, Squidward's house, and Patrick's house. Inside Squidward's house, Squidward is preparing himself dinner.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there. [sees Squidward clink both glasses of wine and drinks them both] Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone! [gets an idea] Ah! [pulls out a flashlight] Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you. [shines a light down at Squidward's house and makes a shadow puppet]
[SpongeBob's shadow puppet gives Squidward a relaxing massage.]
Squidward: Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good. [sees SpongeBob's shadow puppet] Huh?! [clings to the wall and screams as if he's seeing a ghost]
SpongeBob: Hmm, maybe he's hungry. [his shadow puppet tries to feed Squidward his dinner, but he runs over to the door] Come on, Squidward! Eat your... [his hand cramps up] Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp! [his shadow puppet cramps up and throws everything around. Squidward's dinner falls on Squidward] Ow-ow-ow-ow! [his shadow puppet knocks over the table; Squidward tries to open the window, but gets hit by the shadow puppet. He escapes through the front door and runs away] Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep. [shivers as he sleeps] Oh, I wish I had my bed... [almost slips, but suddenly notices a bunch of scrap pieces of wood and metal in the dumpster; he chuckles] Hey, that gives me an idea.
[SpongeBob grabs several wood from below and begins building himself a bed. He sharpens a pencil with his head, draws a line on a board and saws it in half. He hammers a board with a nail.]
SpongeBob: [picks up a board] Uh-huh. [rubs sandpaper on the piece of wood with his butt] Oh, yeah. [hugs the piece of wood]
[SpongeBob shoots glue on a piece of wood and glues three stumps on it for support. He hammers the last nail and his bed is completed.]
SpongeBob: Perfect. Good night... [wind blows] nobody.
[SpongeBob shivers in bed. His wooden blanket flew off by the wind. The sun now rises. Mr. Krabs is now seen with a mug of coffee.]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo, SpongeBob! Time to wake up!
SpongeBob: [extremely tired] Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [drinks some coffee] I've come up with a solution for your little roof problem, boy-o! [gently yanks the rope that holds the grill]
[Squidward hoists the grill up to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: Now you can cook even if you can't get back down.
[The grill sets itself in front of SpongeBob. He happily wakes up from his tiredness and hugs the grill.]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now start making me money!
SpongeBob: Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again! [kisses the grill] Something still doesn't feel right, though.
[SpongeBob grabs some nails, sticks them on a board and nails it down on some wood. He uses his tongue as a measuring stick to measure another board. Then he saws, drills and hammers three boards at the same time. He holds two boards in his mouth to drill holes in each board. He hammers the last nail and his replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen on the roof is completed.]
SpongeBob: Perfect! Just like my old kitchen. [pushes his nose which opens his pants; he takes out his spatula and throws several patties on the grill] I'm ready! [dings a wooden ring-bell and brings in a plate of Krabby Patties with three napkins beside] Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers? [gasps and gets an idea when he sees napkins being blown by the wind] Eureka!
[Meanwhile, inside the restaurant downstairs, the customers are starting a riot on Squidward and Mr. Krabs.]
Customers: We paid for patties, Krabs! Where's our food?
Mr. Krabs: Hey, calm down, everyone. I'm sure we can figure something out that doesn't involve violence or...refunds.
Gus: [sees patties parachuting down from the roof on napkins] Hey, outside! It's raining Krabby Patties!
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Huh?
[The customers run out of the restaurant and get their patties. Frankie Billy slides on the ground and catches the patty with his mouth.]
Umpire: Safe!
Jennifer Millie: I'll take one Krabby Patty and a drink, please. [sticks out her tongue and a patty lands on it] I said, "And a drink!" [a cup of soda falls on her face]
[Harold lays out a table and prepares to eat his patty. But Buddy climbs up and eats it before him.]
Frankie Billy: [chews on his patty] Huh? [spits it out] These are cold! I paid for a hot meal.
Customers: Yeah! [shouts]
Frankie Billy: Maybe if we go up there, we can get 'em fresh!
Norma Rechid: To the roof!
Customers: Yeah! [climb up the ladder and reach the rooftop]
SpongeBob: Whoa! I better make more room up here.
[The scene changes to the rooftop made into the replica of the main Krusty Krab dining room.]
Mr. Krabs: You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser. [SpongeBob groans dejectedly as he felt offended by Mr. Krabs' words] But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming! [kisses the money]
SpongeBob: Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.
[Meanwhile, at the ground floor of the Krusty Krab, Squidward decorated the entire dining room with his art. He even renovated his counter into a bed.]
Squidward: Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now. [jumps on his bed and goes to sleep]
[Meanwhile, on the roof of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are continuing filling out orders for the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: Ten more patties, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. K.
[Suddenly, the sky turns dark as rainclouds block out the sun. SpongeBob flips the patties and wind starts blowing.]
SpongeBob: Aw... [screams as the patties are getting blown away]
Mr. Krabs: [gets hit by the incoming patties] No, no—me money! [chases his money, but crashes into the customers and gets blown away by the wind]
Customer: [gets blown by the wind] Hey, I just realized being outside is awful!
[Patrick still remains on his chair, and eats all of the flying Krabby Patties. Soon, the weather starts to rain and thunder.]
Fred: Rain? But we're under—[gets blown away by the wind]
[The customers prepare to climb back down and take shelter from the storm.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait, don't go! [chuckles nervously] A little wind never hurt anyone!
Patrick: Whoa, whoa! [gets hit in the face with an incoming patty, falls off the roof and crashes to the ground] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: [clings onto the roof] SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!
[As quick as a flash, SpongeBob builds the entire Krusty Krab on top of the original Krusty Krab roof. Everyone inside, including Mr. Krabs, is amazed now that they are safe from the storm.]
Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful, boy-o!
Henry-Bart: Yeah, it's pretty nice, but now that we're not outside, I'm starting to get bored.
Customers: Yeah, so... [chatter as they head out the door]
SpongeBob: [stops them] Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing! [stuffs a radio inside his head, puts a tape cassette in his mouth and starts playing music; then he starts to dance] Whoo! [giggles as he shows off his dance moves]
[As SpongeBob shows off his dance moves, the customers and Mr. Krabs starts to feel the rhythm and joins in the dance.]
Customers: He's right!
[The customers stomp their feet to the music. Outside, the rain starts wearing out the mud, and so the Krusty Krab begins to sink in. Meanwhile, Squidward is still sleeping, oblivious to the fact that the Krusty Krab is sinking in. Everyone upstairs still continues to dance as the original Krusty Krab sinks into the mud. Suddenly, the rain stopped and out comes a rainbow. Everyone comes outside happy.]
SpongeBob: Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!
Mr. Krabs: You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!
SpongeBob: And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!
[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and the customers laugh. Meanwhile, underground, Squidward wakes up from his nap and looks at his watch.]
Squidward: Time to go home already? [jumps off his bed and heads to the door, but bumps into dirt] Ow. [screams as dirt floods the entire bottom floor of the original Krusty Krab]
