[The episode begins at nighttime in Bikini Bottom.]
Sandy: Howdy, neighbor. It's your old pal, Sandy Cheeks with a true to life tale direct from Bikini Bottom. It's the end of another long day, and every critter in town is getting ready to hit the hay.
[Fred is shown brushing his teeth and Debbie Rechid is reading a bedtime story to her child.]
Farmer fish: [punches the hay stack and forms into a bed] Whoo-hoo! [jumps on the hay bed and goes to sleep]
[The scene goes to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
Sandy: Even little old SpongeBob and Gary are laying down their weary heads.
SpongeBob: [crawls into bed with Gary] Night Gare-bear. [yawns and goes to sleep]
Sandy: Now snails love to sleep, but they also like to have their fun. And clever little Gary here is no different. [giggles as Gary forms a slime decoy of himself and slithers off the bed] With a dang nifty decoy in place, Gary is ready to hit the town.
[Gary exits SpongeBob's house and slithers to Squidward's garbage cans.]
Sandy: But first things first. That gooey little varmint is mighty hungry. [chuckles as Gary climbs into the garbage cans and eats some trash] It may not look like much to you and me, but this here is four-star dining to a snail. [laughs]
[Gary hops over to another garbage can and eats some more trash. Suddenly, Patrick appears from the trash and he looks angry.]
Sandy: Now, Gary never minds running into a friend, but old Patrick here don't seem ready to share his meal.
[Patrick and Gary hop out of the garbage cans and they chase around. Patrick barks at Gary like a mad dog. Gary makes a loud roar, which terrifies Patrick. Patrick then turns and runs away.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary feels as big as a ten-point buck right now, but he's about to be reminded that life ain't all fun and games. Especially when animal control is on your tail.
[Just like what Sandy said, a truck pulls over and an animal control officer named Marvin appears.]
Marvin: Freeze, slime ball!
Gary: Meow. [slithers away]
Marvin: Hmm? [growls]
[Marvin goes to chase Gary, but he slips on the trash goo. He falls onto the ground while getting his capture pole tangled to his head. With Marvin all tangled up, Gary laughs and checks his watch. He then tiptoes away.]
Sandy: As much as Gary likes getting one over on the heat, he has more important matters to attend to.
[The scene changes to Gary slithering to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: This here is old Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket. Gary ain't here for vittles, though. No one's ever at the Chum Bucket for vittles.
[Gary enters the Chum Bucket through the restaurant's sign. He breaks through the ceiling vet where he almost woke Plankton up with the metal door. He then slithers across the ceiling. Gary's slime drops into Plankton's mouth. Plankton coughs and spits the slime out before going back to sleep.]
Gary: Whew!
[Spot is shown sleeping on Plankton's bed.]
Sandy: That there's Spot. Plankton's pet amoeba and Gary's best friend.
Gary: Psst.
[Spot wakes up and starts barking.]
Sandy: Spot's cute, but about as dumb as a barrel of hair. [Spot's barking is making Plankton and Karen uncomfortable to sleep] Gary better think quick or they'll both be busted before their night's even begun.
[Karen puts earmuffs on her monitor and goes back to sleep. Gary lowers his left eye stalk to cover Spot's mouth. But Spot forms a mouth on the other end of his body and resumes barking. Karen bangs on the desk to stop the noise. She accidentally hits Plankton.]
Plankton: Ough! [groans before going back to sleep]
[Gary covers Spot's other end and lifts him up. Then Gary and Spot leave the Chum Bucket to begin their nighttime activities.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary and Spot have been sneaking out for ages though their owners are none the wiser. [giggles as Gary and Spot play together] They love playing all sorts of games together, but their doggone favorite is wrestling.
[Gary and Spot wrestle around for a while until they flung themselves through the chimney of the Krusty Krab. They both end up on top of the grill in the kitchen.]
Sandy: It's the Krusty Krab kitchen. What a stroke of luck.
[Gary looks around for Spot until he finds him.]
Sandy: Gary and Spot must have worked up quite an appetite with all them fun and games.
[Gary and Spot's stomach rumbles and they smell something really good. The smell is coming from the refrigerator. Gary and Spot's mouths water and they go to the fridge to get some food. But unfortunately, the door is locked.]
Sandy: Uh oh. That ice box is locked up tighter than a horse thief in a hoosegow.
[Spot gets so mad with hunger. He barks and knocks everything over, making a big mess in the kitchen. He hits the fridge and knocks it over before flying out into the dining room. The fridge opens and food comes out.]
Sandy: Oh boy. It's chow time.
[Gary goes to eat until he hears Spot barking in the dining room. Gary sees how hungry Spot is and comes up with an idea. He morphs himself to look like SpongeBob and imitates the SpongeBob laughter. Spot happily barks and hops onto the tables while knocking them over. He peeks into the kitchen and sees what Gary's cooking. Gary is piling up food onto a plate and makes a humongous sandwich.]
Sandy: Whoo-whee! Looks like Gary is cooking up some fun.
[Gary pushes the plateful of food on the window and rings the bell. The food falls onto Spot and Gary jumps out. Gary and Spot then go to eat their meal.]
Sandy: It may not be pretty, but to a critter, chow is chow.
[Gary and Spot both eat all of the food until there's nothing left. Then they go to play around, leaving the Krusty Krab a big mess. At the very same moment, Marvin drives by, looking for Gary.]
Marvin: Come out, come out. [gasps as he hears Gary in the Krusty Krab] Oh, there you are. [bursts through the front door and Gary and Spot stop playing; he slips on the floor, but gets up] Ha ha! I've got you this time. [slips on the Krabby Patty and falls on his face]
[Gary and Spot quickly run off to escape the animal control officer. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in and is not very happy.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahem.
Marvin: [holds up his license, but is covered in tomato goo] Animal control, citizen. I'm hunting an errant snail.
Mr. Krabs: I don't give a sea fig about snails! You tripped me silent alarm! [points to an alarm bell with a mime face on it while making a faint tapping noise] Just look at this mess! [attacks Marvin with his claws] Take that, you varmint! [continues attacking Marin] Take that!
Marvin: Ow! Ow! Ow!
[Gary and Spot escape the Krusty Krab while Mr. Krabs continues to attack Marvin.]
Sandy: [giggles] Looks like our boys gave Johnny law the slip again. [Gary and Spot head over to an old sunken ship] Reckon they're gonna need some place to lay low for a while.
Gary and Spot: Whew!
[Suddenly, eerie eyes appear from the darkness. The eyes get closer and reveal themselves to be random animals. Snails, worms, sea urchins, and sea horses.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like their hiding spot's already occupado.
[Just when it looks as though the animals are going to attack Gary and Spot, they instead huddle with them for they seem to know them.]
Sandy: Luckily for them, Gary and Spot are already pals with everyone here.
Patrick: Let's get this party started!
[One worm, who is the DJ, cranks up the music and all of the animals including Patrick dances. However, at that very same moment, Marvin drives up and hears the music.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like the fuzz ain't gonna give up so easy.
Marvin: Hey, this is my jam. [goes in to join in the dancing]
Sandy: They say that music soothes the savage beast.
Marvin: [slides in and dances to the music] Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Sandy: But sometimes it works on knuckleheads too.
Marvin: [spins on the floor] That's how you do it. You do it. You do it. [stops dancing; the DJ worm stops the music in shock] Uh, you animals are under arrest? [the animals and Patrick growl angrily] Uh... Uh oh.
[The animals and Patrick lunge at Marvin and attack him.]
Sandy: Youch! That's gotta hurt. Oh mama!
[Gary and Spot abandon the fight and escape the sunken ship. They both hide behind a rock. Marvin comes out and throws Patrick and the animals into his truck. Then he drives away.]
Sandy: I guess this party just got pooped. [Spot cries, but Gary comforts him] Luckily, SpongeBob's little Gare-bear always has something under his shell.
[Spot slithers under Gary to form wheels. Then Gary and Spot follow the truck to the animal shelter. They both slam into the front door, which is locked up tight.]
Sandy: Locked doors are never a problem for a snail like Gary.
[Gary forms a slime key and Spot uses it to unlock the door. Spot gives Gary the A-Ok and the duo enter the animal shelter. As they wonder down the hallway, they see their animal friends and Patrick locked in cages.]
Sandy: Now to most animals, the pound is scarier than a bobcat in your long johns. But Gary and Spot are on a mission to save their pals.
[They continue wondering down the hallway while seeing everyone looking depressed while being imprisoned. But when they reached the end of the hallway, they find an emergency cage release lever.]
Gary: Ah-ha!
[Spot hops onto Gary's shell, takes his left eye stalk and lassos the lever to pull it down. The cages open and Patrick and the animals are free.]
Patrick: Huh? [cheers with the other animals]
Gary: [softly] Meow! Shhh!
[Patrick and the animals stop cheering. They all slither to the officer. Gary peeks in the office and sees Marvin feeling sad.]
Gary: Hmm?
Marvin: Oh, Marvin, you can catch every snail in Bikini Bottom, but the only thing you've really caught is loneliness. [cries and coughs] And kennel cough.
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Sandy: Marvin here ain't kith nor kin to Gary, but that don't matter none. Gary could never bear to see anyone looking so down.
Marvin: [blows his nose through a tissue] I need another snot rag. [leaves his office]
[Gary turns to Patrick and the other animals and tells them about Marvin's problem. Patrick and the animals look at each other in worry. Marvin comes back in the office with another tissue and blows his nose in it.]
Marvin: Hey! How did you animals get out?
[Gary, Spot and the animals suddenly appear dressed up in fancy clothes and playing smooth jazz music. One worm slithers up to Marvin.]
Marvin: Wh—wh—what's going on?
[The worm takes Marvin to the table and sets him down on the chair. Patrick comes in and holds out a can of generic snail food.]
Patrick: Et voilà. [opens the can with his teeth and pours the food on his plate]
[Gary spits out some slime and forms it into a beautiful woman.]
Marvin: [gasps] She's beautiful.
[Marvin falls in love with the slime woman and takes her on a date to Glove World!. They both ride the roller coaster, but the slime hits the people in back of them, much to the disgust. Then they both have a caricature draw a picture of them.]
Marvin: Oh! That's so good!
[Sometime later, Marvin and the slime woman he called Alice are having a wedding at the animal shelter.]
Marvin: I do. [kisses Alice]
[Patrick, the animals and the wedding attendees cheer happily.]
Marvin: I can't thank you all enough. You brought love into my lonely life. Everybody's free to go. [opens the front door]
[Patrick and the animals happily run out.]
Patrick: [laughs] Why am I running?
[Gary and Spot both slither out and head back to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: With their friends rescued, it's time for our boys to finally get some shut eye.
[Spot licks Gary, climbs up to the restaurant's sign and waves goodbye to Gary before going back in. Gary turns and heads back to SpongeBob's house. Upon arriving there, he sees Squidward grumbling to himself while he's picking up the trashy mess Gary and Patrick made.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary slithers back into SpongeBob's house and climbs back into the bed, pushing the slime decoy away. He then slithers into SpongeBob's arms and goes to sleep.]
Sandy: After his long night of adventuring, Gary is more tired than a bronco on busting day.
[Just then, the alarm clock goes off.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and gasps] Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up.
[Gary wakes up and gives SpongeBob a friendly smile.]
SpongeBob: Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt. [goes back to sleep with Gary]
Sandy: Well, that's the long and short of it. See y'all next time for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.
Gary: Shh!
[Sandy groans and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]
