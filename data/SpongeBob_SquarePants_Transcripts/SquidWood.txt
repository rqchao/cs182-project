Squidward: [sighs happily] I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock. [notices SpongeBob standing next to his bed]
SpongeBob: Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward? [SpongeBob is spit out of the island head, into the air.] Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later! [cuts to Squidward planting. Right before he puts in a plant, he sees SpongeBob's face in the hole] Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
Squidward: No, and leave me alone! [puts the plant in the hole, covering SpongeBob's face. Then a flower springs from the ground with SpongeBob's face on it.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in front of a canvas]
Squidward: Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. [right before he begins to paint, SpongeBob's face appears on the canvas]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward paints a giant red 'NO' on the canvas] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his library]
Squidward: [sighs] Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word. [Opens book and SpongeBob jumps out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, wanna play? [Squidward shuts book, with SpongeBob in it, and puts it back on the shelf. Muffled] Okay, Squidward, see ya later. [cuts to Squidward in his bathtub while playing with his nose. He notices SpongeBob watching him from his window and screams] Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first. [closes the curtain] Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins. [laughs] Defeat has never tasted so sweet. [phone rings] Yello? [SpongeBob's mouth pops through the receiver into his ear]
SpongeBob: How 'bout a game of hangman?
Squidward: How 'bout a game of hang up? [slams down phone] Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. [as he walks out of the bathtub, he is sprayed in the face with mud. SpongeBob is drilling into his bathroom]
SpongeBob: How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks &amp; Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings &amp; Queens? Mahjong? [Squidward is beginning to fume and he picks up SpongeBob and shakes him angrily] Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
Squidward: It's called, "I will never play with you... [yells in SpongeBob’s ear] ...ever!" [throws SpongeBob into the hole and moves the refrigerator over it]
SpongeBob: Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward... [jumps out of hole] I'll just make one of my own! [fridge falls on top of Squidward, squishing him. He squirms out from under it and sees SpongeBob running back to his house]
Squidward: I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the... [pneumatic tools whirring and grinding are heard from SpongeBob's house. Squidward walks over to his house] SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this... [door opens and knocks Squidward down]
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward. [Squidward screams and hides behind a bush] Squidward! It's me, Mini Squidward!
Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Mini Squid: Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: What manner of annoying scheme is this?
SpongeBob: Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
Squidward: Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
Squidward: [sighs] Hello, Squidward.
Mini Squid: Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
Mini Squid: SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.
Squidward: So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
Mini Squid: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you! [kisses Mini Squid then runs off laughing hysterically] Woo-hoo-hoo! [pole vaults through his house window. SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mini Squid sitting next to SpongeBob's pineapple playing charades]
Mini Squid: [Spongebob shows three fingers] Three words. [moves his hand as if he was rolling the hand crank of a movie camera] Movie title. [Spongebob nods that all are correct; gasps] "12 Angry Jellyfish."
SpongeBob: How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
Patrick: [to Mini Squid] Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
SpongeBob: Actually, Patrick, this is...
Patrick: D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to Squidward working at the Krusty Krab serving Krabby Patties to a couple, sounding monotone.]
Squidward: Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty? [The customers are silent and look irritated] See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. [SpongeBob and Mini Squid walk in]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
Mini Squid: Of course, I am. I love to work!
Sandals: Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?
Suzy Fish: I don't know, but isn't he handsome?
Sandals: Yeah, he is handsome. [Squidward starts mumbling] Ahem.
Squidward: Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service? [Mini Squid pops up from under the cash register]
Mini Squid: Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Sandals: Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.
Mini Squid: Well, thank you very much.
Sandals: I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.
Squidward: Fine then. Do my work for me. [puts his hat on Mini Squid's head and walks away]
Squidward: I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
SpongeBob: Order up, Mini Squid!
Mini Squid: Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Here you go, pal! [flips six patties on Mini Squid's plate] Go get em', tiger! [Mini Squid walks over to the customers]
Mini Squid: Okay, now, who had the Krabby Patty, and who had the Krabby Patty? [both fish laugh]
Squidward: [alarmed and irritated] What the...? That's my joke!
Sandals: Wow, honey, this new Mini Squidward is such a card!
Suzy Fish: And a great waiter, dear.
Sandals: Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward. [Squidward mumbles angrily]
Suzy Fish: Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip! [shows $300]
Squidward: What? All right, all right! [he has Mini Squid back off] That's enough! My break is finished. [walks behind cash register]
Squidward: Oh boy! Back to work!
Mr. Krabs: Hold on a second, there.
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this — well, not that sorry — the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks! So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately. [hands Squidward dirty dishes] Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
Mini Squid: Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.
Jimmy Gus: I, for one, love to watch people dance while I eat. Who's with me? Who wants Mini Squidward to dance for our amusement? [everyone cheers]
Mini Squid: Well, gosh, okay. [SpongeBob changes Mini Squid into a purple aerobics outfit. Mini Squid starts dancing when the music starts. Some customers dance the same thing Mini Squid and SpongeBob are dancing]
Squidward: What's the big deal? Those are all my moves! [dances the exact same moves but no one is impressed] Ta-da!
Fred: [gasps] Talk about no talent!
Harold: Maybe Squidward should get sized-reduction surgery so he'll dance better! [everyone laughs]
Squidward: That Mini Squid... [Mini Squid continues to dance and plays the clarinet to everyone's amazement]
Mini Squid: Everybody dance! [everyone dances. Music stops and Mini Squid takes a bow]
Squidward: That was awful! [all cheer for Mini Squid and Squidward begins to fume as confetti cows down and party horns sound]
Squidward: He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend! Stop stealing my life! [walks over and does bodily harm to Mini Squid before an agent shows up]
Milo: Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please! You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!
Squidward: Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
Milo: Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for "Curly Bubbles Records."
Squidward: You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
Milo: The answer to that question is a big N-O. [points to Mini Squid] This little fella on the other hand is woo-hoo woo-hoo good! We're offering him a million dollar contract and a sequin suit.
Squidward: [gasps] A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original. [plays "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" from Cinderella on his clarinet and dances]
Squidward: Now, where do I sign? [Milo laughs]
Milo: Yeah, right, kid! [takes Mini Squid]
SpongeBob: Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies! [laughs] Remember?
Mini Squid: Yep, those were the days.
SpongeBob: But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. [speaks Italian] Arrivederci, [speaks French] mon frere.
Milo: Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't. [laughs, coughs and leaves]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cries] Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
Squidward: My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I have something even better! [takes out a mini SpongeBob] Another me! [Mini SpongeBob and SpongeBob laugh back and forth while Squidward's eye twitches]
