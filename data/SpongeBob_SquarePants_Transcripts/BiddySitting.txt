[The episode begins with a big baby bottle that says "SquarePants and Star BabySitting." SpongeBob paints on the bottle and Squidward reads the bottle.]
Squidward: [reading the bottle] "SquarePants and Star Babysitting"? Oh, please. What do you two nitwits know about taking care of babies?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just watch!
[SpongeBob and Patrick pull out powder.]
Squidward: Huh?
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to put powder on Squidward while SpongeBob pulls supplies out of the bottle.]
SpongeBob: [pulls out a safety pin] Safety pin! [puts it in the powder cloud before pulling out a bottle of ointment] Ointment! [applies the ointment to the powder cloud] 
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop putting powder on Squidward. When the powder cloud disappears we see him wearing a baby bonnet and a diaper and holding a rattle.]
Squidward: Goo. [sadly] Goo... [cries like a baby until SpongeBob sticks a pacifier in his mouth. Squidward starts sucking on the pacifier]
SpongeBob: Aww, such a good wittle Squiddy.
[Squidward then realizes he is acting like a baby, so he jumps up and spits out the pacifier, which bounces off SpongeBob and lands in Patrick's mouth. Patrick then starts sucking on the pacifier.]
Squidward: No one in their right mind would ever hire you as babysitters!
Mother: Yoo-hoo! Babysitters! [SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward look towards the front of Conch Street where they see a woman waving to them] I could use some babysitters here!
SpongeBob: [Patrick squeals] Oh, boy!
[SpongeBob brings the baby bottle with him and runs into Squidward. Patrick hops onto the bottle before Squidward falls on his face. He then crosses his arms. SpongeBob and Patrick make it to the woman's house in front of Conch Street.]
SpongeBob:  "SquarePants and Star Babysitters" at your service!
Patrick: We sit on babies!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Not literally.
Patrick: Yeah, not in Italy.
Mother: [waves goodbye with her hat] Now you kids behave and listen to the babysitters. Bye now!
SpongeBob: Bye! [SpongeBob closes the door and sees all the babies. One baby is climbing the stair railing, another baby is chewing on a football, a baby comes out of the floorboard, a baby comes flying with a balloon until pops, and the baby falls into the floorboard, two babies are playing with the lamp, one baby is on the chair, and another baby falls in a TV.] Whoa! A whole liege of little darlings. [SpongeBob and Patrick put on helmets with rattles on them. They start shaking them.] Alright, Patrick, you take East plank, and I'll take the West, and we'll try to establish a map zone in the middle. 
Patrick: Hahahaha! These babies are no match for my... toddler style! [Patrick pulls out a pair of bottles in chains that they look like nunchucks. Patrick starts whipping the nunchuck bottles around and makes ninja sounds until he falls on his face.] Ow.
[We cut to Patrick watching the babies cry until he makes a funny face. The babies stop crying and start laughing. Patrick makes more funny faces until he stops and makes the babies cry. SpongeBob has five spoons on his head until Patrick puts another one on his head. With six spoons, Patrick lifts SpongeBob up and dips the spoons in baby food. SpongeBob feeds the babies until they stopped crying. A baby is seen on the shelf, knocking plates over. SpongeBob catches the planes, so they won't break. The baby falls off the shelf SpongeBob screams and manages to catch the baby. SpongeBob is relieved that he caught the baby, but the plates fall over the floor. The babies now are crying once again until their diapers stink. SpongeBob puts a close pin on his nose and flips them over with a giant spatula.]
SpongeBob: [whistles] Bring her down!
[Patrick uses a claw to grab the babies. SpongeBob removes the diapers with a vacuum cleaner. He puts powder on their butts until he puts new diapers on them. Patrick releases them and SpongeBob flips them on their beds while the babies fall asleep. SpongeBob puts them to bad and high fives Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Yeah. 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
[Bubble transition to the next scene where the mother comes home. She puts her hat on the coat rack and notices SpongeBob reading a story.]
SpongeBob: And they all lived happily ever after inside an oyster shell.  
Mother: Aww... Thank you, SquarePants and Star.  
[The mother hands them money. Patrick takes it and puts it in his pocket while he is sleeping. Bubble transition to the next scene where SpongeBob and Patrick are looking for someone for babysitting.]
SpongeBob: Babysitting! 
Patrick: Skinny or chunky! Clean or funky! 
SpongeBob: We won't get paid if your kid's mislaid!
Mary: Oh, boys, right here! Oh, I could use a babysitter!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [They rush towards Mary] While you go out, and dance, and drevel...
Patrick: ...While we watch your little devil!
[SpongeBob and Patrick swirl her around.]
Mary: Yes! Thank you! [hugs Patrick] Thank you! [hugs SpongeBob then runs off]
SpongeBob: Wait! Where's the baby? 
Mary: She's inside! I'm free! I'm free! Hahahahaha! 
[Mary hops happily while SpongeBob and Patrick look confused at each other. But they both shrug and enters the house.]
SpongeBob: Baby! [shakes the rattle] Baby?
Patrick: [holds up a pillow] Is this the baby? 
SpongeBob: Hmm? No, I, I don't think so. 
Patrick: Huh. Oh! [holds up a lamp] This looks like a nice baby girl. [turns the lamp on] 
SpongeBob: She's nice, but she's not a baby. [Patrick throws the lamp.] Wait a minute. [SpongeBob runs to a wheelchair and looks down.] I found the baby. 
[SpongeBob turns the wheelchair around and shows Patrick the baby. But it wasn't a baby, it was Mary's mother from "Chocolate with Nuts." She is shown asleep and it startles Patrick.]
Patrick: Eek! That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen! 
SpongeBob: Patrick, all babies are beautiful. Even the ugly ones, and we don't know the baby's name is. 
Patrick: She looks like she's been in the tub too long. Let's call her Baby Prunes. 
SpongeBob: What a pretty name! Little Baby Prunes.
[They both laugh until Mary's mother wakes up and screams as she sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Mary's Mother: Who are you?! Where's lazy Mary?! 
Patrick: The baby can talk! 
Mary's Mother: Help! Help! It's a robbery! 
[SpongeBob puts a pacifier in her mouth.]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, Baby Prunes is just mimicking what she's heard. It's just baby talk. She's babbling. 
Mary's Mother: [spits out the pacifier] I'm not babbling, you bone heads! 
Patrick: Feeding time! [pulls out a spoon full of food] Here comes the airplane. [makes train noises and puts the food into Mary's mother's mouth, but she spits it out] Yum. Playtime! [Patrick dumps out some blocks and throws the bottle away.] Kids love to build things with blocks! 
Mary's Mother: [chuckles] Oh, I'll build something alright.
[We cut a bubble transition to all the blocks built into a jail with SpongeBob and Patrick in it. SpongeBob writes on the wall. Inside the play jail, there is a toilet, a pipe, a bunch, and a shelf filled with books. SpongeBob checks his watch.]
Mary's Mother: Put me down you yellow scouring pad! Unhand me! [cuts to SpongeBob walking to a spot in Mary's house and Patrick pulls out a baby cradle.] No! [SpongeBob puts Mary's Mother in the cradle.] Get me out of here! [SpongeBob puts on a baby hat Mary's Mother tucks her in a blanket and staples it to the cradle.] Ow! Ugh! Ouch! [Screams.} 
SpongeBob: Oooo! Who's a colicky baby? It's you! [SpongeBob tickles Mary's Mother in the neck with one finger.] Coochy coochy coo!  
Mary's Mother: Bleh. 
SpongeBob: I'll go up and prepare a bath for Baby Prunes for when she wakes up. 
Patrick: Okay. While you're doing that I'll just space out. Uhhh...
[As SpongeBob goes upstairs, Patrick's eyes turn upwards and drools. Mary's Mother looks at Patrick with his eyes upwards, and then escapes from the cradle by using a secret door at the bottom of the cradle, and runs away chuckling evilly. Meanwhile, at upstairs SpongeBob is at Mary's bathroom. SpongeBob turns on a faucet on a bathtub.]
SpongeBob: Strange... There don't seem to be any baby items in here. Hmm... [looks in a cabinet to find not baby items but old woman stuff.] Okay, pills, pills, dentures, more pills, hemorrhoid cream. [SpongeBob closes the cabinet but then notices a little birthday note stuck on the bottom left corner of the cabinet.] "Happy birthday to mother on her 137th birthday." Aw. [gasps and realizes the truth] 137th birthday?! Ohhhh! Baby Prunes isn't a baby, she's an old lady! 
[Meanwhile, Mary's mother is trying to escape from Mary's house using her tongue to unlock the door]
Mary's Mother: Come on, come on! [Just then Patrick comes along with his eyes still upwards]  
Patrick: Is that a puppy I hear? I didn't know they had a puppy. What is it puppy? You wanna go out? [Mary's Mother frees her tongue out, a light bulb appears on top of her head]   
Mary's Mother: Oh. [barking]
Patrick: There you go puppy.
Mary's Mother: So long sucker! [maniacal laughing] Uh... [barking]  
Patrick: Huh, the puppy knows baby talk too... [Just then SpongeBob comes in from the stairs]
SpongeBob: Patrick! She's not a baby! [SpongeBob falls from down the stairs and hits Patrick and looks around while he's on Patrick's stomach.] Where's Baby Prunes? 
Patrick: I dunno, I just let the puppy out. 
SpongeBob: That was no puppy! [SpongeBob is jumping on Patrick's stomach] That was an old lady! An old lady that we're responsible for! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run outside to find Mary's Mother] 
SpongeBob: If you were an old lady where would you go?! 
Patrick: Ah, I don't know back in time?! 
SpongeBob: What about a sewing circle?
Patrick: Ah, yes a sewing circle back in time.
SpongeBob: Come on! [SpongeBob and Patrick go into a sewing circle with some old ladies] 
SpongeBob: Old lady Prunes? [The old ladies look at SpongeBob and Patrick in wonder] Have you seen a baby that's really an old lady? 
Bakery Cashier: Oh, look they have shmoods on their faces. [she spit on a napkin which then the other ladies follow]
SpongeBob: No, not that. [Patrick and SpongeBob are scared while the old ladies rub the napkin on their bodies]
SpongeBob: Ah, where's baby/old lady Prunes?
Patrick: No, no gross. [Patrick is disgusted while the old ladies rub them.]
French Narrator: Meanwhile... [cuts to a scene into a lava surf place.] 
Surfers: Yeah!
Mary's Mother: Yee-Haw! Lavabunga! [While Mary's Mother is having fun the other surfers on gone and loses the challenge, then she laughs maniacally then we cut to a scene where their parachuting]  
Skydiver: What are you doing you don't have a parachute?
Mary's Mother: Parachutes are for babies. [then she jumps and laughs maniacally while the skydiver is surprised] Oh yeah! [she falls into a haystack]
SpongeBob: Prunes!
Patrick: Old lady Prunes! 
SpongeBob: Old lady baby Prunes! [Mary's Mother is wrestling and throws and boxer on SpongeBob and Patrick] 
Mary's Mother: Well, if it isn't my two babysitters! you humiliated me!  
SpongeBob: Prunes, you're alive!
Patrick: And still talking baby talk! [They run to her and she mumbles angrily]
Mary's Mother: Why! [she then punches them in the face] 
SpongeBob: Ahh, Pruny wants to play nice old lady [then she repeatedly hits them until they become realistic]
Patrick: Ah, boxing tired her out. [then they fall out of the tree]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
SpongeBob: Ah, another job well done. [sniffs] Uh, Patrick, I think she needs to be changed.
Patrick: No, that's me. [The episode ends by them walking toward the sun set.]
