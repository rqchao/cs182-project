[episode begins at Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break. [slurps his drink and makes a relaxed face] Ahh.
Patrick: That's a pretty cool face. [chuckles] Check you this one out. [chomps, chews]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! [laughs]
Patrick: Oh, hey, how about this? [dolphin call]
SpongeBob: That's awesome! [SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [snores] Ooh. I know that sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet! [SpongeBob and Patrick laughs] SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
SpongeBob: Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I were making faces at each other.
Patrick: Funny faces make me laugh! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
SpongeBob: Why, is there something wrong?
Mr. Krabs: Haven't ye ever heard the saying "If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way"?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh, no!
Mr. Krabs: Let me tell you the story of face freeze. [thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly] It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. [Fred raspberries and laughs] But what he really liked, was sticking his tongue at people. [Fred raspberries and laughs, Norma and green Monroe gasp]
Norma Rechid: How rude! [Monroe cries]
[Fred raspberries]
Mr. Krabs: Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, [Fred raspberries] his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
Fred: Huh, huh... Huh?
Mr. Krabs: ...permanently!
Mable: Weirdo.
Fred: [muffled] No... no!
Mr. Krabs: He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, no!
Mr. Krabs: So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mm-mm.
Mr. Krabs: Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
SpongeBob: I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
Patrick: Done and done.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
Patrick: Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
SpongeBob: Yeah. This is... [gulps] easy. How you holding up?
Patrick: Huh, fine. You?
[SpongeBob grunts, but makes an T-shaped face and laughs]
Patrick: [laughs] Dun ah eeh.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are both laughing, until SpongeBob stops and looks at his himself]
SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick is still ignoring him while laughing] Patrick. [pulls out a megaphone] Patrick!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
[Patrick stretching]
Patrick: Gosh, you're right.
SpongeBob: Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.
Patrick: You mean like this? [stretching] Ree eeh eeh!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both, SpongeBob growls]
Patrick: [laughs] Aye yi yi yi!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aw!
[montage of SpongeBob and Patrick making grotesque faces]
Patrick: Phee!
SpongeBob: Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
Patrick: Dun ree ah yee!
SpongeBob: Doy doy doy doy!
Patrick: Ah ah ooh!
SpongeBob: Duh!
Patrick: Aydh!
SpongeBob: Awoot duh doo!
Patrick: Looo ooo ooo!
SpongeBob: Day ah dah da dah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]
SpongeBob: I can't breathe! [SpongeBob grabs a mirror and they look into it] Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
Patrick: Yes! But, how to choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross, [Makes his eyes go up to the top of his head] uh? And then slip into an overbite. [Pulling out upper jaw] And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... [He pushed his nose, makes his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head] The Gary. Meow!
Patrick: [chuckles] Gloriously disgusting, sir.
SpongeBob: Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]
[scene cuts]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick come out of the ocean]
[Everybody swims away screaming]
Sandy: [paddling up on a surfboard] You two need help.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing again]
[scene bubble transitions into night]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on the flashlight.]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
SpongeBob: It never gets so old!
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
[Squidward rips the tent]
Squidward: Do you mind?!
SpongeBob: Mind what? Making faces? Of course were don't.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
Patrick: You got that right, pal! What a silly question.
SpongeBob: Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face.
Squidward: I don't wanna make faces. I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
SpongeBob: That's a good one right there.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: Oh, good one, Squidward!
Squidward: Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
SpongeBob: Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
Patrick: Oh yeah? Watch me.
[They both sleep]
Squidward: Whatever works.
[Later, the sun rises]
SpongeBob: [Surprised] Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!
Patrick: Actually, I can't move my face at all. [He feels on his face]
SpongeBob: I can't move my face either!
Patrick: [oblivious and excited] All right! We did it!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! [Patrick then realizes the situation and gets scared.] Patrick, we have the face freeze!
[Both scream]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy! Sandy!
[Later at Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
SpongeBob: And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?
Sandy: Well, I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. [shows Sandy's hands looking creepy] You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. I can feel them knots just meltin' away. Let's see if I can just finesse that jaw line back in place. [Later, Sandy is done] Phew! Okay, you two. Bad news first. That wicked face freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.
[showing that SpongeBob's and Patrick's faces are more deformed]
Mr. Krabs: [At the Krusty Krab] Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hello, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks with his back towards him to the kitchen and Mr. Krabs goes in as well]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, you all right, boy? Eh, look a little cattywampus walking in here.
SpongeBob: Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'...
Mr. Krabs: Ahem. Uh, but what's with the skewed posture?
[He touches SpongeBob's head and SpongeBob knocks his claw away]
SpongeBob: Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Penny? Where?! Where?! [Looks for a penny]
SpongeBob: That'll buy me some time.
Squidward: Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are piling up.
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Squidward! [starts slicing an onion, but onion juice gets in his eyes] Onion juice! Ah!
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [Falls, retrieves patties on back] Ow! Phew. Order up.
Squidward: You deliver it, I'm on break.
Mr. Krabs: Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny. [sniffs] Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance. [passes Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...
SpongeBob: Your order is served, sir.
Harold: [Gasps when he sees that SpongeBob's lips are drooling on the patties] I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!
SpongeBob: Oh, dear.
Harold: [Takes money out of register] I'm taking my clams elsewhere.
[As SpongeBob tiptoes behind Mr. Krabs on the way back to the kitchen, Krabs takes notice of Harold leaving and chases him to the door]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, come back!
SpongeBob: Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face? [whimpers]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
SpongeBob: Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts.
Mr. Krabs: Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o. [SpongeBob turns around with his face down] So I can see your face.
SpongeBob: Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? [shows him a rolling trick] My impersonation of a burrito!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh? [Sees Patrick walk in with face freeze]
Patrick: [Sees Mr. Krabs and gets worried] Oh. Is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I see what's going on here. [Picks up SpongeBob and turns to see his frozen face.] Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
SpongeBob: [Guilty] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories.
Mr. Krabs: I'm losing business because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah! [Mr. Krabs' anger gives himself the face freeze] No! I can't move me face. I've got the face freeze, too!
Squidward: What is the hold up in hereâ€”?
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! you could get the face freeze!
Squidward: Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too! [begins laughing hard] This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh. [sees Patrick, begins laughing very hard and he too gets face freeze] Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. [begins crying]
Mr. Krabs: Look! Squidward has it, too!
[All three begin laughing while Squidward keeps crying]
Squidward: Hey, it's not funny! Stop laughing!
