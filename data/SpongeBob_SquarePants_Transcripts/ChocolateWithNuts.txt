[SpongeBob is sitting inside of a box humming. He checks his watch. The mailman opens the mailbox, which turns out to be SpongeBob sitting inside his mailbox]
SpongeBob: Hi, mailman!
[The mailman yells in fear, and runs off]
SpongeBob: Okay, [gets out of the mailbox] see you tomorrow!
[Patrick walks up]
Patrick: Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?
SpongeBob: Let's see... [Looks through the mail] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!
[SpongeBob looks at the magazine]
SpongeBob: That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [They look inside the magazine] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
[A picture of a rich person's swimming pool is shown]
SpongeBob: This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!
[A picture is shown of an old, rich person surrounded with bags of money]
Patrick: [Points at the man's feet] This guy's got shoes!
Squidward: Give me that! [Takes the magazine out of their hands] Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?
Squidward: They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
SpongeBob: What kind of things?
Squidward: How should I know? Things people wanna buy. [walks off] Now keep your paws off my mail.
SpongeBob: That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!
Patrick: Is that gonna hurt?
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?
Patrick: Uh... [sweats] More time for thinking.
SpongeBob: No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.
Patrick: [pops up behind him] A chocolate bar?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick exiting the Barg'N-Mart carrying many chocolate bars]
SpongeBob: Fancy living, here we come!
Patrick: Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.
[SpongeBob runs up and knocks on the door, Tom the fish opens the door]
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some [holds up chocolate bar] chocolate?
Tom: Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!
Patrick: Yes, sir. With or without nuts?
Tom: Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slowly back away, and then run off. Tom chases them while madly screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob ringing the doorbell of another house] 
SpongeBob: Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! [A Con man opens the door] Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?
Con man: Chocolate bars, eh?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!
Con man: Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
[Patrick is shown holding many chocolate bars in his pants]
Con man: No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, most certainly, sir!
Con man: Well, [chuckles] no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! [He holds up a bright-orange bag]
SpongeBob: Wow... what is it?
Con man: It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!
[SpongeBob tries to touch it]
Con man: [pulls bag away] But, I'm wasting my time. [Walks inside] You don't need these bags.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We need 'em! We need 'em!
[The Con man grins, the scene changes to the Con man counting money. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking away with armfuls of bags]
Con man: So long, boys! Happy hunting! [Laughs when the two aren't looking] Suckers... [walks back inside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing as they run off] Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!
SpongeBob: Let's try next door!
[SpongeBob walks up and rings the doorbell with his foot, the same Con man comes out]
Con man: Yes?
SpongeBob: Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?
Con man: I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. [Holds up two large maroon bags]
Patrick: We'll take twenty!
[Scene changes to SpongeBob knocking on the door of a different house, Sadie comes out]
Sadie: Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
Sadie: That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.
SpongeBob: One chocolate bar, coming up!
[SpongeBob attempts to pull out a chocolate bar, but keeps pulling more bags, while Patrick is zipping and unzipping his pants]
Sadie: [Sadie looks at her watch] I don't have time for this.
[Sadie goes back inside, and then SpongeBob pulls out a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— [Sees something off camera; it is revealed to be Tom, still screaming]
Tom: Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!
SpongeBob: —lady. [Tom chases SpongeBob and Patrick again while screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a diner] We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.
Patrick: Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
SpongeBob: No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?
Patrick: He said we were mediocre...
SpongeBob: That's it! He made us feel special!
Patrick: Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
[Patrick runs to the door]
SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick!
[Patrick freezes in place]
SpongeBob: Why don't we try being nice?
Patrick: Oh, okay.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to a customer's door]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.
[Patrick knocks on the door, a customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Hello?
Patrick: I love you.
[A harp is heard playing, the customer stares at SpongeBob and Patrick for a few seconds, then he slams his door shut in extreme disgust, a tuba is heard playing after the slamming]
SpongeBob: I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.
[SpongeBob rings the doorbell, the customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Please. G-Go away!
SpongeBob: Um, [clears throat] H-H-How you doin'?
Blue Fish with purple stripes: How am I doing?
SpongeBob: Wanna buy some chocolate?
Patrick: We got him now!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?
[Patrick's belly is bubbling]
Patrick: Hee hee, it tickles!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.
[The customer holds up a picture of an obese self at age 13]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: You can keep that for five bucks.
Patrick: I'll take ten!
[Cut to SpongeBob with a sad look on his face walking, a sad song plays]
SpongeBob: We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.
[Cut to Patrick staring at the pictures]
Patrick: Huh?
[Far cut]
SpongeBob: [raising his fist] Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Patrick: [Removing pictures from his face] Huh?
SpongeBob: [Holding out his hand] Let's shake on it.
Patrick: [Looking at SpongeBob confused] Did you say something?
[Cut to the other customer's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen entering the view]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, focus.
[Cut to the door, SpongeBob knocks on it, customer answers]
Purple Fish: Yes?
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.
[Patrick somehow moves up to the customer with his eyes going in and out back and forth]
Purple Fish: Why is Chubby here staring at me?
[Cut to Patrick's eyes]
Patrick: Focusing.
[Cut to the inside of the customer's house]
Purple Fish: [freaks out] Back up, Jack!
[The customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes, Patrick is heard saying "Oof!" from the other side of the door]
Patrick: [Moving eyes around] Nice place you got in here.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is eating a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I can't understand what were doing wrong.
Patrick: I can't understand anything.
SpongeBob: There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!
[Cut to the sign]
Patrick: [reading the sign] Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: They are most certainly not delicious!
Patrick: [smiling] Not the way I use them!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: [Happily] That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
Tom: Chocolate!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run off, cut to Mary's house]
SpongeBob: We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!
Patrick: The kill!
[SpongeBob uses the doorbell, Mary answers]
Mary: Yes?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Hello, young lady.
[SpongeBob winks at Patrick, Patrick then chuckles]
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate. [Getting a closer look at Mary] Is your mother home?
[Cut to Mary]
Mary: Mom!
Mary's Mother: [Entering from the right side of the house] What, what, what's all the yelling?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who have stunned looks on their faces. Cut back to Mary's mother]
Mary's Mother: You just can't wait for me to die, can you?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Mary: They're selling chocolate.
Mary's Mother: Chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: What, what are they selling?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: What?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: I can't hear you!
Mary: They're selling chocolates!
Mary's Mother: They're selling chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to a close-up of Mary's mother smiling]
Mary's Mother: Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.
[Cut back to view Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: I always hated it!
[Cut to SpongeBob sweating]
SpongeBob: Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...
[Patrick comes from the top left]
Patrick: You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
[Cut to Mary and her mom, Mary is heard saying no constantly]
Mary's Mother: Live forever, you say? I'll take one. [Mary slaps her face. Cut to the outside, Mary pays SpongeBob a dollar]
Mary's Mother: [From inside house] Come on, you lazy Mary! [Cut to Mary] Start rubbing me with that chocolate!
Mary: [looking at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily] I hate you. [Slams door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
Patrick: [Raising fist] Hooray for lying!
[Bubbles transition to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick is seen with a look that was about to make him laugh]
SpongeBob: It'll make your hair grow.
[Cut to Fred]
Fred: Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick has a sad face this time]
SpongeBob: They'll make you sound smart.
[Cut to the customer holding money]
Customer: [southern accent] I'll take twenty!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
[Cut to the two Patricks]
Patrick 2: Just in time.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick over and over]
SpongeBob: They'll make you fly!
Patrick: You'll fall in love!
SpongeBob: They'll bring world peace!
Patrick: You'll walk through walls!
SpongeBob: [echoing] You'll rule the world!
[Cut to a door, SpongeBob and Patrick are wrapped in casts. Cut close to Patrick]
Patrick: This'll be the best lie yet!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!
[Customer opens door]
Customer: What can I do for you boys?
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.
Customer: Really?
[Cut to the customer, who apparently is in a cast covering his entire body]
Customer: Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are completely stunned]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Ah, some guys have all the luck.
[A violin begins]
Customer: I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, they both have faces meaning that they were about to cry]
Customer: At night, [As SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face] I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
[Cut to the customer, the wires snap]
Customer: [About to fall] Oh, no...
[A glass breaking sound is heard while the customer grunts while hitting the steps]
Customer: [On the last step] Ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, let's help him!
[Cut to the inside of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick enter from the left]
SpongeBob: Careful, put him down gently.
[Patrick drops the customer's head, a glass breaking sound is heard, cut close to the customer]
Customer: [In pain] Ow...!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. [gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
Customer: Such nice boys, [far cut to the customer] it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!
[Cut to a close-up of the customer laughing while looking at his cash, zipping his costume off to reveal himself as the Con Artist from earlier. Cut to the street]
SpongeBob: [grunting] Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
[SpongeBob makes another grunting noise, he trips up on a rock and falls, cut to SpongeBob with a box flat on his face]
SpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
Patrick: [Walking in from the left] I can live with that. [Places box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]
SpongeBob: Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
[Tom appears behind the box]
Tom: Chocolate! [Screams and knocks SpongeBob, Patrick and the boxes over. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick babble]
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Patrick] No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Patrick: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!
[Cuts to Tom laughing manically]
Tom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... [turns back to normal] I'd like to buy all your chocolate. [Holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked, chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three, SpongeBob and Patrick melt]
SpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, Patrick is pushing a wheelbarrow]
Patrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
[Cut to the money in the barrel, SpongeBob pops out]
SpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.
[Cut to the two]
Patrick: But what are we going to spend it on?
[Cut to SpongeBob thinking. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, a boat in a bottle with "Fancy!" on top is seen. Cut to the inside of the boat]
Squidward: [Walking in from the left] Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
Server: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.
[Cut to Squidward shocked]
Squidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?
Server: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs [leaning over to Squidward] and their dates.
[Cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mary, and Mary's mother, Mary is seen holding a glass]
SpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?
[Pause]
Mary's Mother: What? What did he say?
