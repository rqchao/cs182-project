TV narrator: [SpongeBob is watching the movie while eating popcorn] We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.
Man being chased: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot]
SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out! [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] 
Gary: Meow! 
SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep. Dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting] Robot! OH MY GOSH! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk] 
Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] 
Radio DJ:  [From the radio] And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: "Electric Zoo." [techno beat is heard. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money] 
Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad! I love this young people's music! [scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer goes off] 
SpongeBob: I SURRENDER!!! Oh... 
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose] 
SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? 
Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order! 
SpongeBob: #17 -- [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. 
SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Thaddeus] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? 
Thaddeus: No, I'm not. 
SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. Back to work! [he runs away, Thaddeus shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] 
Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! 
SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] 
Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. 
SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged." [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. 
Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. 
Radio DJ: [From the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? 
Mr. Krabs: The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep." 
Radio DJ: No, man, you're thinking of wee-wub-wub-womp-wub-wub-womp.
Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [Garbled telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [Garbled telephone noise] Bop...? [Garbled telephone noise] Beep?! [Garbled telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams] 
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! 
Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] 
SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. 
Squidward: [confused] How did you...? 
SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. 
Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? 
Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. 
Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. 
SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward? 
Squidward: [chuckles nervously] Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? 
Mr. Krabs: Why? 
Squidward: It was rated "ARRGH!" [laughing] "Arrgh!" Because it's... about... pirates. 
Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! 
Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] 
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break. Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! 
SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. 
Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! 
SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face] 
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. 
SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.] 
Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, then proceeding to scream in pain] OH, MY EYES!!!! [continues screaming] 
SpongeBob: Mr...! [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] 
Squidward: Will you be quiet?! Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? 
SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. 
Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! 
Mr. Krabs: [Barges out; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket] AHHHH! AHHHH!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!!! OHH!!! AHHHH!! AHH! AHHH!! AHHH!!! AAAAHHHHH!!!! AAAHH! 
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] 
Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! 
SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! 
Operator: Hello. You've reached the Navy's automated phone service. 
SpongeBob: Squidward! The robots are running the Navy! 
Squidward: NOT THE NAVY!!!! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? 
SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [he points at it] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Sorry. 
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. 
Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? 
SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. 
Squidward: They poop on the robot? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. 
Squidward: I never thought I'd say this but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [grabs the book titled “How To Torture” and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob &amp; Squidward enter] 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob &amp; Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] 
Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! 
Squidward: I said [slaps him again] "shut up!," you bucket of bolts! 
SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? 
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! 
Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. [Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. 
Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. 
SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first. 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talkin' about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him again] 
Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot.
Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] WHAT?! [his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob] You think I'm a ROBOT?!?!
Squidward: We don't think; we know.
Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender]
Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. 
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy."
Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
Squidward: We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat]
Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you going to do to me blender?! That cost me money!
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talking, eh? [breaks the blender with the bat]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO! That cost me $24.95! 
SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.
Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk]
Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk] $62.67! [Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks it] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder]
Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.
SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.
Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own.
SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [sobbing]
Squidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated, the scene then exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.]
Mr. Krabs: [Growling, starting the background shaking] SQUIDWARD!!!
