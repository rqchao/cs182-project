[The bus stops at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs comes out of it and enters the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Mornin', Squidward! [Grabs a ladder and takes a speaker off of the wooden beam and throws it on the floor] Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find...

Mr. Krabs: Well, that's very interesting, Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight, we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!
Colonel Carper: [Laughs heavily]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?
Colonel Carper: You are! And the fact that you think you have any idea what it takes to put on a musical tour!
Mr. Krabs: We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
Colonel Carper: You call that a tour bus? [Walks over to Patrick who is still holding the same speaker] You call this sound equipment? That's not a roadie, these are roadies! [Points over to two very large and muscular fish standing beside Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ahhhh!
Colonel Carper: I'll tell you what, I'll let you open for Ned and the Needlefish on one condition: My roadies get to sabotage your sound equipment and have it blow up during your sound check!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Colonel Carper: Oh, that will be free!
Mr. Krabs: [Shakes Carper's fin] Deal!
[Bubble transition to a stage]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top! [Squidward plays a note but the speaker overhead instanly explodes] Doggonit...

Squidward: We're performing at a supermarket? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, Squidward, but that is physically impossible!
Squidward: What!?
Mr. Krabs: Because it's not there anymore!
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?
Mr. Krabs: I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
SpongeBob: [Ears explode] You did what?!!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.

Mr. Krabs: [Reading a map] Uh...not too much farther, Squidward! Uh...oh, in fact, we're just entering it now! [Turns on a sign that literally says "Next Town"]
Squidward: Well, if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last! [Notices Mr. Krabs parking at run down place called Electronics Outhouse] What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Goodbye! [Tires to leave off bus but Mr. Krabs quickly closes it on his face]
Mr. Krabs: This ain't our next concert!
Squidward: Well, then, where is it!?
Mr. Krabs: It's uh...uh...um...[He, Squidward, and SpongeBob notice a crowd heading toward a stadium] Well, it's right over there obviously! [Drives to the stadium that says "Ned and the Needlefish Today" on it and they get off the bus] I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I got some important tour management business to attend to, you know!
Squidward: Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs closes the door on Squidward and drives back to the "Next Town" sign and hammers something to it then drives off. Ned and the Needlefish then drives up to the sign]

Squidward: Yeah. I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!
SpongeBob: Oh? Are there people showing up?
Squidward: Isn't that... what you we’re talking about? [The stage opens up and he smiles and he hears the crowd cheering] Ah, just soak on in, Squiddy, old boy! Pretty invigorating, isn't it? Wait a minute... why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"
SpongeBob: No, can't you hear them, Squidward? They're saying “Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...” [Notices the lights turn on and the crowd stop chanting]
Harold: That does not look like Ned and the Needlefish! [He along with the crowd start booing]

Patrick: Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
Crowd: [Looking at the beautiful sky] Oh....ah....
Mr. Krabs: [Sets up a stand] Thank you! Come again, please! [Puts money in the register, then in the bag] He he he!
