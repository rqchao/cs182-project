[The episode begins at Bikini Bottom High School. A teenage fish walking past gets a doughnut thrown on him in which two teenage fish laugh and then spits on his friend's face. Another teenage male fish with headphones attempts to say hi to the teenage female fish who pass him while chatting but they only remove them and put them on the floor and walk off. A teen bully fish does a wedgie to a teenage nerdy fish who screams but the nerdy fish twists his nipple really hard causing him to run off crying. While all this is happening, Pearl and her friend is sitting down on a bench talking]
Pearl: Boy, do I love high school. [small laugh]. You know what? Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... Remember?
Pearl's friend: [laughing] Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?
Pearl: [Joyfully]Â Of course I didn't forget. I'm so excited.
Pearl's friend: [laughs] Me, too!
[They both laugh until Pearl's friend stops in shock]
Pearl's friend: [In horror] Barnacle!
Pearl: What!?
Pearl's friend: Pearl I'm gonna say this as touchily as possible. [pointing] There is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face!
Pearl: [Shocked] Where!?
[Her friend moves her face so she can see it]
Pearl's friend: There!
[Pearl notices the barnacle growing and starts screaming. So much that the entire Bikini Bottom is looking at her.]
Pearl's friend: Pearl, it's not really bad as you...
[She screams again. All of the high school students are looking at her again. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob appears to be whistling while mopping the floors]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops mopping] Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't you already mop this area?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Affirmative, captain!
Mr. Krabs: Well, then, why would you mop it again?
SpongeBob: Why wouldn't I? [there is a pause]
Mr. Krabs: Good point.
[Pearl enters the Krusty Krab in tears]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
Pearl: Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend.
Mr. Krabs: Oooh, that is terrible. [he shivers] Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
Pearl: No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!
Mr. Krabs: [comes closer] Why ever not?
Pearl: Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face!
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you... [pus is shown oozing out of the barnacle; Krabs screams] Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
Pearl: We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!
Mr. Krabs: Anything for me beloved angel!
Pearl: Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of... [Krabs stops her, angrily]
Mr. Krabs: I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund. [this causes Pearl to cry again, soaking a table Harold and Nat are having lunch at]
Harold: You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.
Nat: I heard they have better weather over there. [They leave the Krusty Krab] 
Mr. Krabs: [chases after them but fails] No! Wait! [Pearl continues to wail] This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream. [He notices SpongeBob mopping past him]
SpongeBob: [sings]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob stops] How would you like to... [He salutes] At ease! [SpongeBob drops his hand] How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
SpongeBob: I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!
[bubble transition to Pearl walking with SpongeBob]
Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!
SpongeBob: Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!
Pearl: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.
Pearl: How?
SpongeBob: I took him to see a hypnotist.
Pearl: You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
SpongeBob: No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
Pearl: I thought you said it was a barnacle.
SpongeBob: What did I say?
Pearl: Pelican.
SpongeBob: [pauses for a second] He was a really good hypnotist.
[bubble transition to Pearl's room]
SpongeBob: Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
Pearl: Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
SpongeBob: [laughing] Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. [hits the barnacle]
Pearl: Is everything okay?
SpongeBob: [shows broken spatula] I don't think this is going to work. [Brings in a shovel] This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work! [hits the barnacle]
Pearl: Did it come off?
SpongeBob: [the shovel is stuck in his head] Gettin' there.
[Next, SpongeBob tries removing the barnacle with a jackhammer.]
Pearl: SpongeBob, how much longer?
SpongeBob: Oh... shouldn't be too much longer. [the jackhammer disintegrates] Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.
Pearl: Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he throws the jackhammer aside, which lands in a pile of other broken tools]
[In the bathroom, Pearl is putting some soap on a towel and scrubbing it on her barnacle. She suddenly screams and SpongeBob hears it]
SpongeBob: [walks into the bathroom] Pearl! [Pearl is seen with soap covering her face] Pearl, what happened?
Pearl: There's more! [the soap slides off her face, exposing lots of barnacles everywhere]
SpongeBob: [shrieks] I mean, you're right. There's more.
Pearl: [puzzled] All I did was wash with soap and water!
SpongeBob: [examines the soap] Hmm... Water and... this soap?
Pearl: Yes, but why?
SpongeBob: [sniffs the bar of soap] Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere. [keeps sniffing the soap] Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?
Pearl: No.
SpongeBob: [continues sniffing] More for me!
[we cut to the living room, where Pearl is seen with her face smothered in concealing cream. She mumbles something]
SpongeBob: [holding the jar of cream] No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. [Mr. Krabs enters the house with the groceries]
Mr. Krabs: [humming] Pearl, I'm home! [screams loudly]
SpongeBob: Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized... [sweetly] it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl. [Pearl mumbles again] Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of. [Mr. Krabs walks over to a safe full of diamonds and jumps in] Me jewels!
[later, Pearl is in the bathroom crying again]
SpongeBob: Pearl? [knocks on the bathroom door] Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.
Pearl: [from inside] I'm not going to the dance!
SpongeBob: Okay, I'm coming in! [opens the door, which causes a flood of tears to gush out into the hallway. SpongeBob swims against the current and makes it in] Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.
Pearl: And what exactly would that do to me?
SpongeBob: I have no idea. [Pearl bawls] Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!
Pearl: How?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up. [something DOES pop up, and it's more barnacles] Oops, I didn't mean it like that. [sees the bar of soap and picks it up] Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. [starts sniffing the soap again]
Pearl: [snatches it away]
SpongeBob: Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
Pearl: In the basement. Duh, where else? [scrubs her face more]
[Torch in hand, SpongeBob is entering the darkened basement when he hears a strange noise]
SpongeBob: [echoes] Hello? [SpongeBob jumps when he hears the echo, but keeps going until he hears another noise and turns around] Something there? Pearl?! [His torch goes out, making it completely dark. SpongeBob sees a door opening and goes through it to find Mr. Krabs, trying to pull a stuck handle] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this! [they both pull at the handle until it moves] There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?
Mr. Krabs: Why, it's my old soap press!
SpongeBob: Soap press?
Mr. Krabs: That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: Leftover Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: [tosses a Krabby Patty into the machine] Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap! [the new soap falls off the conveyor belt into a basket] Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
SpongeBob: [picks up one of the soap bars and sniffs it] Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...
Pearl: [lividly] I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty essence.
Pearl: That's grease!
Mr. Krabs: Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose-
Pearl: [furiously] Daddy! [throws soap at her father]
Mr. Krabs: [runs away in fear] Got to go, you kids have fun!
Pearl: [bursts into tears and rubs her eyes making squeaky sounds] I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?
Pearl: [wails] The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!
Pearl: Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
SpongeBob: Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...
[cut to SpongeBob on a ladder and Pearl beside him in her room]
Pearl: Are you done yet?
SpongeBob: [climbs down the ladder] All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three. [turns Pearl's chair to face the mirror. Pearl has blue diamonds on her face to hide her barnacles] And, ta-da. What do you think?
Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?
SpongeBob: [walks her to the living room] We shall see shortly.
Pearl: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: [opens the front door] Shh. Trust me.
[Three of Pearl's friends, a green fish, a blue fish, and a pink-orange fish, enter the house]
Blue fish: Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the- wow! Pearl, you look amazing!
Pearl: I do?
Blue fish: Well, not amazing. Sparkly and shiny and amazing!
Pearl: Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Pearl and her friends: [laughing] Let's go! [they run out of the house, and SpongeBob shuts the door behind them]
SpongeBob: You have a good time, carefree teens!
Mr. Krabs: [screams and exits his jewel safe] My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
SpongeBob: Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Mr. Krabs: Help! Police! Thief! [runs out of the house, running through the door] Stop that whale!
SpongeBob: I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise.
