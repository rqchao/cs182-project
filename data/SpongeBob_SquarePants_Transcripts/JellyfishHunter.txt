[A jellyfish flies in the sky.]
French Narrator: Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
SpongeBob: La la la la, la la la la la! [SpongeBob catches it] You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you "Twelvey." [tickles it with a feather] Coochie coochie coo! [it sneezes out some jelly] Bye, Twelvey! [Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish] Oh! It's you! [He mimics the jellyfish's style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish, but fails] Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.
No Name: [buzzes] [caption reads: "Bring it on!"]
SpongeBob:  [yells battle cries and tries to catch it. He runs. He steps on a soda can. He then runs so fast he flies like a rocket] Gotcha! [he is unsuccessful at catching it] ...Barnacles, how'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name.
[cut to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob: Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! [he imitates a rocket launching and lifts his bag into the air] [a jar of jelly and a Krabby Patty fall out of the bag. He puts the jelly on the Krabby Patty and starts eating it.] Yum! [makes sounds, moans]
Fred: [Looks behind and stares at SpongeBob in confusion.] Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
SpongeBob: Why, this is a hole, good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically...
Fred: Not that! [points to SpongeBob's jelly patty] That!
SpongeBob: It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Fred: Could I try some?
SpongeBob: Sure! [gives Fred some jellyfish jelly into his Krabby Patty]
Fred: [Eats the Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly] Amazing... I've got to tell someone about this! ♪Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to meeeeeee... I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich, it's no ordinary sandwich, it's the tastiest sandwich in the sea. Ah de ba da ba doo ba da ba de ba da da. Yeahhhhh... [The other Krusty Krab customers applaud him.] Thank you!♪
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
SpongeBob: No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. [Showing some fish eating jelly patties happily. Shows love hearts and extremely satisfied customers.] Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Fred: Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life! [A bill with Fred appears in it] Hey, buddy, you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [speechless, mutters incoherently]
SpongeBob: You okay, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob: But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh, no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
SpongeBob:  [gasps] No! Never!
Mr. Krabs: [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs:  [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting a sign saying "Home of the Jelly Patty"] I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
SpongeBob: [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words "I Love Jellyfish" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!
[SpongeBob has a mustache on. A sign next to a jellyfish hive reading "FOR RENT" is shown. Jellyfish come in. They are trapped in a large net]
Mr. Krabs: [customers are lined up] More, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is driving a large replica of himself. Its hand shows up at the Krusty Krab with a jar full of jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: What don't you understand about... more?!
[Many SpongeBobs catch jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: More! [SpongeBob catches two jellyfish with a net] More! [SpongeBob catches a jellyfish with a jar] More! [SpongeBob catches some jellyfish with a net while jumping leftwards to the screen] More! [SpongeBob tries to catch some jellyfish with a net by jumping rightwards to the screen] More... [SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as "Moar Krabs."] MOAR. [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] MOAR, MOAR, MOAR, MOAR. MOAR, MOAR. MOAR! [Cut to night. A sign reading "Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0" is seen. "4 Million" is crossed out]
SpongeBob: Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
[No Name secretly follows him]
SpongeBob: It feels like somebody... WANTS TO SELL ME SOMETHING! [Turns around and sees nobody]
Businessman: [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was on to us.
SpongeBob: [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in as he looks out the window] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
No Name: [breathing]
SpongeBob: [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly?! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
No Name: [buzzing, shows a net and jar]
SpongeBob: [inside the jar] No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]
Robot: Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
SpongeBob: What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
[Mr. Krabs is riding on an exercycle. It turns out that he's the monster who's responsible for this when SpongeBob caught the jellyfish of the fields]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?
[Mr. Krabs is shown wearing headphones and listening to an upbeat pop tune] 
Singer in the recording: ♪Give it all you got! Dance, dance, dance, get on it! Take it to the top...♪
SpongeBob: [breaks in, riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name taps him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boy, what are you doing with that?
SpongeBob: [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a LONG TIME AGO!
Mr. Krabs: NOO!
SpongeBob: The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Mr. Krabs: [relieved] Whew!
SpongeBob: And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open"! [Mr. Krabs realizes what he just said, and he covers his mouth, but it's too late. The sign on the door lights the words "OPEN" and the jellyfish escape.]
SpongeBob: Freedom! FREEDOM!!!
Mr. Krabs: YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME!!!! [He tries to pedal away as he laughs madly, then he looks down.] What?!
[Mr. Krabs sees that pedaling away didn't work, meaning that the excercycle never left the floor, and it remained intact on the floor, namely that an exercycle is meant for working out on it. The scene cuts to the jellyfish just right behind him, hovering over Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Blasted exercise craze...
[The jellyfish sting Mr. Krabs and he screams in pain. The jellyfish escape out the doors, possibly back to Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, friends!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the factory and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
SpongeBob: He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings out his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend." [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]
