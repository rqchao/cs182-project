[The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank"] ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ [then we see the Krusty Krab at night]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. [cringes as he changes the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Closing time!
SpongeBob: Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob! [pulls SpongeBob back] Take that pile of filth out with you. [Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
Squidward: He means this filth, you loon! [He drops the bag on the floor]
[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag]
SpongeBob: [singing] Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.]
SpongeBob: Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" [laughs] "Nematodes are people too!" [laughs] Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. [writes the word "good" after "smells"] Good. [laughs] Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a [dolphin chirp].
Garbage man: [Clearly disgusted] Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
[picks up multiple garbage bags and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
Patrick: [off-screen] Hi, garbage man. [appears on-screen] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
Patrick: "Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?
SpongeBob: [pointing to "Krabs," then the unseen word as they are said] Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
Patrick: Hmm... [dolphin chirp]! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob: Sentence enhancers?
Patrick: You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it! Let me try. [clears his throat] Hello, Patrick. Lovely [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it?
Patrick: Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This [dolphin chirp] day is particularly [dolphin chirp] lovely!
SpongeBob: How [dolphin chirp] right you are, Patrick!
[The two continue to say the word a few more times]
SpongeBob: Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
Patrick: Oh, mine, too!
[both laugh]
SpongeBob: It tingles when I laugh!
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day]
SpongeBob: Hello, customers, nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, uh? [The customers stop eating and stare in shock]
Harold: [gasps] Did he just say?!
Pirate fish: Aye, he did.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: [sitting at table at the Krusty Krab] Pretty [dolphin chirp] good, SpongeBob.
Old Man Jenkins: I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
SpongeBob: [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi, Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: Nice [dolphin chirp] day, isn't it, Squidward?
Tom: I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.
Evelyn: Let's go somewhere more family oriented. [Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]
Female fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] I'm never eating here again.
Male fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes]
Mr. Krabs: [in the bathroom, hears the sirens] Huh? [looks through the periscope, sees that the Krusty Krab is empty and gasps] The Krusty Krab, she's empty! [runs to dining room with toilet paper stuck to one of his legs] All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Squidward: Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Squidward: Er...he said...um, well he said...
[Squidward whispers]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Squidward whispers it again; Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
Patrick: Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Mr. Krabs: There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
SpongeBob: You mean [dolphin chirp]?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, that one! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand up] Now quit saying that! [SpongeBob and Patrick frown] It's a bad word!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues while moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Squidward: Don't you mean there are only 7?
Mr. Krabs: Not if you're a sailor. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, 13.
Patrick: That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We promise.
[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing Eels and Escalators]
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
Patrick: Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
SpongeBob: Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
Patrick: Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]
Patrick: Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
SpongeBob: Darn. [moves game piece to eel]
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Hooray! Escalators! Yay! [screams] Up, up, up!
SpongeBob: Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
SpongeBob: Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?
Patrick: [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
SpongeBob: [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]
Patrick: Eels...
SpongeBob: Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]
Patrick: Ooooh...! You said number 11!
SpongeBob: [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [starts running after him] No, wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!
Patrick: But, you said "[dolphin chirp]"! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]
SpongeBob: Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Patrick: Not if I tell first!
SpongeBob: I can run faster than you! [laughs]
Patrick: [riding on the back of an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha! [the truck turns at the wrong corner] Oh, nooooo!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob: He said, he said, he said!
Mr. Krabs: Out with it, boy!
SpongeBob: [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
Mr. Krabs: [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
SpongeBob: Well, he said...
Mr. Krabs: Yes?!
SpongeBob: Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Patrick: [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone, but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]
SpongeBob and Patrick: He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
SpongeBob: ...number thirteen...
[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling, "Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!"; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-mmm...!
Mr. Krabs: Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initially deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said "[dolphin chirp]"!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]
Patrick: What's going to happen to us?
SpongeBob: We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Patrick: Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
Patrick: I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
Mr. Krabs: All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What [dolphin chirps] genius put a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]
SpongeBob: Five, six, seven...
Mr. Krabs: ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ...
Patrick: Nine...
Mr. Krabs:  Ooh [seal bark, seagull squak]crabbin’ [a new-style foghorn] Ooh-hoo-uh! [cries in pain]
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob with thirteen fingers] That's all thirteen, Patrick! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
[They go to the house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
Mama Krabs: Why, hello there!
[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so]
SpongeBob: Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]!
Patrick: It was terrible.
SpongeBob: And he-- [horn honks]--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!
Mama Krabs: [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mama Krabs: [wakes up] You should all be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors.
[Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand]
Mama Krabs: I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. [laughs, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock] 
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Mother!
Mama Krabs: What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Old Man Jenkins: [driving by] Howdy, Mrs. K! [honks the horn]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs: [all laugh together]
