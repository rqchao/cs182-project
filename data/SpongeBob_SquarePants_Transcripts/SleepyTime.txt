SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear] 
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground. SpongeBob and Sandy spin around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations, other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but the wallet starts bouncing away toward the back of the boat]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: [grins nervously as Krabs glares at him] This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [his head starts circling SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
All: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]
