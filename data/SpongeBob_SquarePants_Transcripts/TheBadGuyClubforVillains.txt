[Patrick's rock shows up, and cuts to Patrick sitting in his chair with a normal expression, watching TV. SpongeBob soon arrives]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Guess what came in the mail today!
Patrick: Oh! What?! [SpongeBob takes out a video tape from his back]
SpongeBob: This... [Screen gets a closer cut of the video tape]
Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy lost episode! Stick it in! [SpongeBob slides the video tape into the VCR and presses a button, the two sit on the couch.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Gagagaga!
Chorus: Faster than light! Prepared to stop crime! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Chorus: If you're in a jam, It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Fish Head: The Adventures of Mermaid Man And Barnacle Boy! Tonight's episode: The Secret Meeting! [Gets a shot of the Mermalair] Deep in the Mercave, something strange takes Mermaid Man's attention!
Barnacle Boy: The Dirty Bubble? What's he doing at the bus stop?
Mermaid Man: Looks like he's got a one-way ticket to Bikini Bottom, and there's only one thing he could be up to in Bikini Bottom, Barnacle Boy!
Barnacle Boy: That's right, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Evil!
[the Dirty Bubble comes out of the bus that comes on]
Dirty Bubble: Haherhaherherherher!
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy look at each other]
Fish Head: The Terrible Man Ray!
Dirty Bubble: Hm, so glad you could make it!
Man Ray: I wouldn't miss this for the world, Dirty! Hahahahah.
Fish Head: The most powerful of all crustaceans, it's Jumbo Shrimp! It’s the Atomic Flounder! The abomination of a nuclear experiment gone horribly wrong! And the terror of the sewers, the man eating Sinister Slug!
Dirty Bubble: We join forces at last.
Mermaid Man: It's worse than I could have imagined! A team up!
Dirty Bubble: Welcome to the BGATFBC! [the Dirty Bubble gives the villains cards]
Everyone: Muhahahahahahahha! [Mermaid Man puts on some binoculars and looks at Man Ray's card]
Mermaid Man: April third, 12 of noon! That's tomorrow!
Barnacle Boy: Holy... [Screen goes fuzzy]
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it! [He pushes a button, and the tape comes out. The tape is eaten by the VCR, breaking some of the tape] Deeae! [he picks up the tape, gets out some tape and scissors, cuts, tapes, and puts the tape back in the VCR]
Barnacle Boy: Great Guppies, Mermaid Man! We gotta do something!
Mermaid Man: Not so fast, little flipper! We are far too out-manned! But fear not. We are always one step ahead of evil!
Fish Head: Our Hero of the bride puts up a call!
Mermaid Man: To the ocean's greatest heroes!
Lady: [tells Mermaid Man that he has to hold his call]
Mermaid Man: Yeah, I can hold.
Fish Head: Meanwhile, a sinister horde congregates outside Hotel Evil!
Dirty Bubble: Right this way, gentlemen! [the crew comes through a door]
Jumbo Shrimp: Hey, what's going on in here?
Dirty Bubble: Huh? Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, gentlemen, you must be in the wrong room! This room is reserved for the B.G.A.T.F.B.C.
Mermaid Man: [in a disguise] That's funny. I thought it was aside for the I.J.L.S.A.
Dirty Bubble: I.J.L.S.A? What in coral caverns is that?
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy take off their hats]
All Bad Guys: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Mermaid Man: That's right! [they both jump out of their coats] Now, before you have to say goodbye, say hello to some friends! [He throws some wind, and it breaks the door, somebody comes out] The Elastic Wasteband!
Barnacle Boy: Greet the hottest crime fighter in the country! [he pours out lava] Professor Magma!
Professor Magma: [Speaks weird language]
Mermaid Man: The illusive Miss Appear! [She appears] And The Pi-Right Ponderer with his hairnet of knowledge!
Pi-Right Ponderer: Do we really exist?
Mermaid Man: Together, we are The International Justice Lodge of Super Acquaintances!
Dirty Bubble: Let's get ‘em, boys! [A shot of the bad guys running is shown, A shot of the good guys running is shown, A shot of the Jumbo Shrimp running is shown, A shot of Mermaid Man flying is shown, Mermaid Man Punches Jumbo Shrimp, he throws Mermaid Man to the wall]
Jumbo Shrimp: Do not tussle with the B.G.A.T.F.B.C! [Mermaid Man falls from the wall]
Pi-Right Ponderer: Violence resolves nothing.
Man Ray: [The Elastic Waistband does a pose] Good night, balloon boy! [Miss Appear appears and takes away man ray's gun]
Miss Appear: Professor Magma! Catch! [Professor Magma melts the gun]
Barnacle Boy: Step aside, you copious cod! My beef is with the bubble!
Mermaid Man: Careful, Barnacle Boy! He's got Nuclear Touch!
Atomic Flounder: Raaaa! [He touches Barnacle Boy on his shoulder]
Barnacle Boy: Nuclear Touch!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aaahh!
Patrick: I Can't watch! [His eyes come through his hands. The nuclear touch shows an arm coming out, and it punches Barnacle Boy right in the face]
Mermaid Man: Fracturing furniture! Hang tight, buddy! [The arm hits Barnacle Boy again and again, Mermaid Man jumps toward Barnacle Boy, The Dirty Bubble eats Man Ray and spits him out at Mermaid Man, but Elastic Waistband jumped in the air, opened his belt and stopped Man Ray]
Mermaid Man: Hang in there, my daring deputy. [a face grows out of the hand]
FaceHand: Your daring deputy is nothing right now! But I'd be happy to pass along out the message! If he ever wakes up, that is!
[FaceHand tries to hit Mermaid Man with Barnacle Boy's body]
Mermaid Man: Swirling Shrimp! That fiend has taken control over Barnacle Boy!
Elastic Waistband: What do we do, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: I'm glad you asked! [Mermaid Man jumps onto the chandelier and swings off of it and jumps onto Barnacle Boy] I believe that if the Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state! Does that sound about right, Professor Magma? [A cut to Professor Magma]
Handface: You'll never do it! You don't have the moxie!
Mermaid Man: That's what you think, curd! [he picks up HandFace and Barnacle Boy] Shield! [Professor Magma turns in the shape of a shield, and Mermaid Man Picks him up, Atomic Flounder grabs shield, and Mermaid Man throws him down] Ha, Ha, Ha! [The Sinister Slug was on the wall behind him]
SpongeBob: Look out, Mermaid Man!
[Mermaid Man looks behind himself]
Mermaid Man: [Gasp]
Sinister Slug: Grrrr! [Sinister Slug spits out slime at Mermaid Man, he avoids it, and it hits Atomic Flounder]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
[Atomic flounder struggles to move]
Mermaid Man: The Sinister Slug's slime has got you stationary and stiff! Which means, your time is up, Hand!
[He pushes HandFace toward Atomic Flounder’s fin]
HandFace: Not Nuclear Touch! [HandFace disappears]
Barnacle Boy: Great Gravy! What just happened?
Mermaid Man: I'll tell you about it later, now let's take out the trash!
Pi-Right Ponderer: Please, you can use my hairnet of knowledge.
Mermaid Man: Thank you, Ponderer.
Dirty Bubble: No! No! You Guys don't understand! It's not what you think! [Bad guys are shown running away from Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy, the duo swoops them up in the hairnet of knowledge]
Mermaid Man: You really thought you were going to get away from it, did you? First up, villains, what’s the BGATFBC?
Man Ray: It stands for the Bad Guys All Together For Book Club!
Mermaid Man: Book Club? You mean you weren't going to destroy a library or something?
Man Ray: Why would we do that? We're almost to the new chapter!
Atomic Flounder: What are you going to do, lock us up for reading?
Jumbo Shrimp: Yeah! You can't prison us for reading!
Mermaid Man: That's right. Remember, kids, no one can imprison you for reading!
[A cut with the end credits are shown.]
Patrick: Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
SpongeBob: Those are called "End Credits", Patrick.
Patrick: End credits? But I don't want it to end!
SpongeBob: That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button! [SpongeBob pushes a button]
Patrick: Thank you, Neptune! [The screen goes back to the beginning and zooms in before the episode ends]
