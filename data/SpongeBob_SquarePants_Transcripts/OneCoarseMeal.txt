Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights, lights a cigar, and bathes in money] Ahh, that's the stuff. [sniffs] Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
Mr. Krabs: Explosive!? [Scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where Plankton is flying on a glider laughing evilly]
Plankton: Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! [activates bomb, which blows up roof]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Plankton: You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Mr. Krabs: Ready ammunition! [SpongeBob takes off his hat and it reveals a pea can. Krabs opens the can with his claw and he pours all the peas into SpongeBob. He then uses SpongeBob as a gun] Fire! [SpongeBob shoots pass at Plankton. The peas shoot through Plankton's air glider. But Plankton blows a bubble over himself causing the peas to be deflected. The deflected peas hit the frying pans. One of the frying pans fall and hits SpongeBob. Plankton then fires a missile at them] Take cover! [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a shield, but the missile just falls straight to the ground] Oh, ha, ha, it didn't go off! Another dud, Plankton.
Plankton: A dud, huh? [He pushed a button which causes the missile to transform into a robotic arm and it squeezes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob]
Mr Krabs: Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
Plankton: No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and I’ll be on my way.
Mr. Krabs: Well you ain't getting it.
Plankton: I implore you to reconsider. [presses button and arm squeezes harder]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, go jump off a plank.
Plankton: I have ways of getting the information I need. Where’s the formula, Krabs? [tickles Mr. Krabs' posterior with a feather]
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha ha!
Plankton: Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs? [He tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground] OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
SpongeBob: I'll never talk.
Plankton: We’ll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
SpongeBob: OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
[Everyone pauses]
Plankton: Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Errrrrrrr...
Plankton: [sniffs] Say what am I smelling? You got something burning?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Smells like blubber to me.
Plankton: Bl bl blubber?
Pearl: Daddy!
Plankton: Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Mr. Krabs: She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Plankton: Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! [As he says this he backs up into the freezer]
Pearl: Did he just go into the freezer?
Plankton: [exits freezer and walks out the door] Don't say it!
Pearl: I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? [chuckles evilly] Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formular, now get us out of this trap.
Pearl: Mall money.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. [gives dollar to Pearl]. Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Pearl: Double my mall money!
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
SpongeBob: Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
Pearl: Hey, this isn't money!
SpongeBob: No, it's even better! This is what Mr. Krabs pays me with. [money is shown] Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
Mr. Krabs: [to self] Oh, it's all catching up to me... [to Pearl] Please, Pearl? I'll do your homework for ya.
Pearl: No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... in that case, Pearl, I'm gonna need to borrow one of your dressers.
SpongeBob &amp; Pearl: Hummina-hunh?/Huh?!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [runs inside]
Karen: My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?
Plankton: Krabs had a whale!
Karen: You mean his big, bad, scary teenage daughter?
Plankton: I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
[Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale]
Karen: OK, when you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.
[Bubble transition to Plankton taking out the trash]
Pearl/Krabs: [emerges from dumpster] I'm hungry!
Plankton: [Screams. He runs back inside and bars the door] That should keep her out!
Pearl/Krabs: [sneaks up behind him] I want plankton meat!
Plankton: Holy protozoa! [runs out the lab] Karen, she's here! She got in!
Karen: What are you talking about?
Plankton: There's a whale in the laboratory!
Karen: Are you out of your mind?
Plankton: See for yourself!
Karen: [checks the lab] No whale in here.
Plankton: I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Karen: Oh, that's enough, Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions. [rolls away]
Plankton: Karen! Karen--!
Karen: I'm not listening! [hums]
Narrator: 16 paranoia filled days later...
Karen: [off microphone] Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me?
Plankton: Yes, I can hear you. Can you bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. [cries]
Pearl/Krabs: [laughs. Bubble transition to night]
Plankton: [Plankton is shown having a nightmare. He is seen being chased by Pearl and falls into her blowhole] Hey! Get me out of here! [Pearl flings him into her throat with her tongue. He falls into her stomach, where his ancestors find him]
Grand-Dad: Hey, Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!
Plankton: Grand-Dad?
Grand-Dad: Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.
Plankton: Gastric acid? [his body is half-burned and he screams]]
Pearl:  [cackles]
Plankton: [wakes up from nightmare and screams] I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! [cries]
Pearl/Krabs: [takes off disguise and laughs. Bubble transition to morning]
Plankton: [crying] What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale! [lies down] That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be along any time now.
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
Plankton: Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
Plankton: Forget it, kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
SpongeBob: Okay!
[Cut to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [erases a picture of Plankton] Goodbye, pipsqueak!
SpongeBob: Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
Mr. Krabs: Really? He's a mess! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
Mr. Krabs: May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
SpongeBob: No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
[scene cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [angrily] Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton.
Plankton: What do you got? Mud in your ears? Take a hike!
SpongeBob: Ah, yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Why should I care? All meaning has left my life ever since I've been plagued by that blasted whale.
SpongeBob: It's okay. Everybody has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... [whispers in Plankton's ear]
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of.
Plankton: You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!? [angrily] Why that conniving bottom feeder!
SpongeBob: But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?
Plankton: No, of course not.
SpongeBob: Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
Plankton: No, thank you! [laughs evilly. Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: This is almost too fun! [puts on costume] Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Plankton: Oh, is that so?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes. [breaths deeply] Boo!
Plankton: You don't scare me, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean... [Pearl's voice] I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Plankton: The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
Mr. Krabs: Secret fear? [regular voice] What are you talkin' about?
Plankton: See for yourself. [the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs] Enjoy the show! [a mime is shown]
Mr. Krabs: No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Plankton: Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, does it scaredy pants? (laughs) I am loving this.
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
Plankton: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. [Plankton gasps. Whales are outside]
Plankton: [scared] Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! [removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! Well, you redeemed yourself, boy.  [to mime] Okay, you really are creeping me out now.
