 
[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a nature hike in the Kelp Forest.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?
[Patrick yawns, falls over and drags himself over to SpongeBob. He gets up with grass all over his body.]
Patrick: It's cutting into my early morning nature nap. [falls over and shakes the grass off]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!
Patrick: Okay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip happily into an ice cave.]
Both: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Cool ice cave!
Patrick: Ohhhhhhh... [walks over to a block of ice] This whole place is a frozen treat! [licks the ice]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!
Patrick: Uh. Now he tells me. [cries and struggles to free himself]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic.
[Patrick screams in panic and wraps his tongue around a stalagmite. However, his tongue pulls him back and he slams into the ice.]
Patrick: I panicked, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob digs into his backpack and pulls out a cup of hot chocolate.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything.
[SpongeBob pours hot chocolate on Patrick's tongue, burning it.]
Patrick: [screams and pulls his tongue off the ice] Hot! Hot! Hot! [grabs a rock and smashes his tongue] Hot! Agh! [sighs]
[Patrick's tongue is now burnt and bruised. Patrick faints and falls asleep. SpongeBob puts his hot chocolate in his backpack. But unbeknownst to him, the hot chocolate completely melts the ice, revealing a cave sponge from within. The cave sponge wakes up and emerges from the ice.]
Spongy Spongy: Uh...?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today.
[SpongeBob pulls out his shoes from his backpack and puts them on. He does a little warm up with his feet and shoes. The cave sponge is sniffing around and takes notice of SpongeBob's shoes. He immediately becomes fascinated by the squeaking noises SpongeBob's shoes make.]
Spongy Spongy: Oh? Ah. [purring] Squeaky, squeaky!
[SpongeBob grabs Patrick's tongue and drags the sleeping Patrick out of the ice cave. The cave sponge starts following SpongeBob and stows away into his backpack.]
Spongy Spongy: [purrs] Mehh.
[SpongeBob drags Patrick to his house and ties his tongue on a rack like a horse.]
SpongeBob: See ya later, Patrick. [leaves Patrick and enters his own house] Gary, I'm home! [takes off his backpack and hangs it on the coat hanger] Boy, this backpack got heavy.
[SpongeBob leaves. The coat hanger bends over and breaks.]
Gary: Meow!
[The cave sponge climbs out of SpongeBob's backpack and sniffs around.]
Gary: Meow.
[The cave sponge sniffs Gary and sees SpongeBob walking with his squeaking shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: Ah!
[The cave sponge follows SpongeBob upstairs to the bathroom where SpongeBob is taking a shower. He sneaks into the bathroom and hides in the sink. SpongeBob, who is now wearing a bathrobe and shower cap, walks up to the sink and sticks his tongue out. The cave sponge sticks his tongue out as well, but his tongue has hair on it.]
SpongeBob: Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue.
[The cave sponge climbs out of the sink and follows SpongeBob to his clothe-changing machine. SpongeBob activates the machine with his nose and it removes his shower cap and bathrobe. It then dresses SpongeBob in his regular pants and shoes and gives him his Krusty Krab working hat. SpongeBob leaves and the cave sponge pulls the button off the wall, causing the machine to go haywire. The machine removes the cave sponge's loincloth and dresses him in SpongeBob's pants.]
Spongy Spongy: Agh-agh-agh!
[The machine goes to put SpongeBob's shoes on the cave sponge's feet.]
Spongy Spongy: [panting] Squeaky! Squeaky! [happy grunts]
[The machine puts the shoes on the cave sponge's feet, but they were too small and they both rip through.]
Spongy Spongy: [groans] No squeaky.
[The machine gives the cave sponge the Krusty Krab working hat and the cave sponge leaves.]
SpongeBob: I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight! [leaves]
[The cave sponge imitates SpongeBob's words in grunts and walks through the wall.]
Gary: Meow?
[The cave sponge follows SpongeBob all over town and still fascinated by the squeaky shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: [happy chuckling] Squeaky! Squeaky! [happy grunts]
[The cave sponge waves his arms back and forth as he follows SpongeBob. However, in doing so, he accidentally destroys a mailbox.]
SpongeBob: [hums and picks up a stick] Ah! [drags the stick against the fence]
[The cave sponge attempts to imitate SpongeBob's tactic. However, he ends up destroying the fence. SpongeBob swings on a nearby fountain. The cave sponge does the same thing, but ends up destroying the fountain. The cave sponge follows SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: It was. [gets punched in the face by the cave sponge] Agh! [falls backwards]
[SpongeBob and the cave sponge enter the kitchen. The cave sponge goes to sniff around while SpongeBob prepares to make relish.]
SpongeBob: I do relish... [pulls out a jar of pickles] making the relish!
[SpongeBob pours pickles in the blender. Then he pours vinegar and grease in the blender and begins mixing them together. The cave sponge is frightened by the blender and hides himself behind several pots and pans  above the condiment table.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [louder] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?! You called me?
Mr. Krabs: Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the kitchen] Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir! [gasps as he sees the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant with Ivy and his smashed-up mailbox]
Ivy: That's the man who smashed my mailbox, officer!
Mr. Krabs: Well?
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!
Mr. Krabs: Of course you wouldn't! It's just this loser's word against yours, boy-o. They can't convict you for that.
SpongeBob: Phew.
Evelyn: He ruined my fountain!
Cara: Yeah, yeah! That's the guy!
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Mr. SquarePants, I'm afraid you're under arrest. [cuffs SpongeBob and drags him out of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me! [screams]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy-o! I'm right behind you! [kicks Squidward's cashier boat] Look alive, Mr. Squidward! [Squidward gets up] I'm gonna visit SpongeBob in the big house. You are manning the grill! [grabs Squidward and shoves him through the kitchen window]
Squidward: [yelling] Ow! [grumbles as he gets up and puts his hat on]
[The cave sponge observes Squidward as he begins flipping a Krabby Patty.]
Spongy Spongy: Ah? [growls] Agh! [takes a bite of the patty and falls on top of Squidward with the pots and pans]
Squidward: They let you out already? Ugh, you look terrible, SpongeBob! [the cave sponge groans] Well, get the food ready. It's almost time for lunch! [leaves]
Spongy Spongy: Food? [chuckles]
[The cave sponge grabs a spatula and a mop and make them into a spear. He jumps in the air and lets out a war cry.]
Spongy Spongy: Agh! [stabs the ketchup bottle with his spear and gets ketchup on his face; he grunts]
[The cave sponge smears ketchup on his left eye as if he is making his mark. The scene changes to the cave sponge hiding behind some garbage cans behind the Krusty Krab. He sees Frankie billy pulling up to the restaurant with his boat. The cave sponge jumps out and lets out a war cry. He jumps on the boat stabs it with his spear, rips open the hood, pulls out the motor, and drinks the oil. He lets out a victory yell and runs back in the restaurant with the motor. Frankie Billy, who is stunned at what he saw, locks the passenger door. The cave sponge places the motor on the grill, puts buns on it and smashes it into pieces with his club. He makes a sandwich and just as he goes to take a bite, Squidward takes it.]
Squidward: Well, it's about time! [takes the motor parts and goes to serve the "food" to the customers]
[Fred goes to bite his sandwich, but his teeth shatter. Abigail takes a bite of her sandwich, but burns her tongue. Gus takes a bite of his sandwich, but chokes on a tire. He spits out the tire and it hits Tom in the face, leaving him marks. The customers are angry and begin a riot against Squidward.]
Customers: This is ridiculous! Is this a restaurant or a garage?
[The customers grab Squidward and throw him into the kitchen.]
Spongy Spongy: Huh?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what did you do? The patties taste horrible! Everybody hates them!
Spongy Spongy: Unh... [growls and pulls out his club]
Squidward: What the— [screams in panic and runs out of the kitchen] SpongeBob's gone crazy! Run for your lives!
Spongy Spongy: [grunts] Spongy! Spongy! [growls as he smashes the tables]
[The customers run out and scream in panic. The cave sponge whacks Nat Peterson's buttocks with his club and goes on a violent rampage across town, causing all sorts of damage in the process.]
Perch Perkins: This is Perch Perkins live at the Krusty Krab, where we understand that a local fry cook has just gone nuts.
[The cave sponge smashes the Krusty Krab sign with his club. The sign falls on top of the restaurant, causing damage to it.]
Perch Perkins: [gets whacked in the head by the cave sponge] Ooh! This just in... Ow!
[Meanwhile, at Bikini Bottom Jail, Mr. Krabs goes to visit SpongeBob. SpongeBob picks up the phone to talk to Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Why did you have to go nuts on company time, boy-o? I'm gonna lose so much money.
SpongeBob: I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent! [taps his squeaky shoe]
[Outside the prison, the cave sponge hears SpongeBob's squeaky shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: Oh? Squeaky, squeaky? [growls as he smashes the fence with his club]
Mr. Krabs: Save it for the judge, boy-o. Come clean! Nobody else even looks like you!
[Suddenly, the cave sponge bursts through the wall with his club, crushing the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant in the process.]
Mr. Krabs: Except that guy.
[The cave sponge wonders around, jumps on the counter and smashes the window, crushing Mr. Krabs underneath. Officer Rob Johnson comes in and is cornered by the cave sponge.]
Spongy Spongy: [growls] Squeaky, squeaky! Squeaky, squeaky!
Perch Perkins: Local scientists now believe that the rampaging fry cook is actually a prehistoric "cave sponge," once thought to be extinct.
Officer Rob Johnson: Ah! Get him off!
SpongeBob: See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!
[The cave sponge drags Officer Rob Johnson, sniffs him, and licks his head.]
SpongeBob: Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to.
[The cave sponge runs away.]
Perch Perkins: Shortly thereafter, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob went to City Hall to confront the wild beast.
Mr. Krabs: We did?
[The scene changes to the police officers and the Bikini Bottomites cornering the cave sponge at City Hall. The cave sponge throws a chuck of the roof to the police officers.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me.
[SpongeBob catapults himself in the air and tackles the cave sponge to the top of the roof.]
Spongy Spongy: Unh? [sniffs]
SpongeBob: Ooh? [giggles and sniffs] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [gives the cave sponge a light punch on the chest]
Spongy Spongy: Unh. Spongy Spongy. [punches SpongeBob in the face]
SpongeBob: Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?
[Spongy Spongy walks to the edge, looks down and sees the police.]
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Hello!
[Spongy Spongy growls in confusion.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone. [walks away]
Spongy Spongy: [growls] Uh. [happily grunts and follows SpongeBob] Oh! Squeaky, squeaky!
[SpongeBob realizes that Spongy Spongy likes the squeaky sounds his shoes make.]
SpongeBob: Oh, you like that, huh? [squeaks his shoes] Ah!
[Spongy Spongy imitates his movements. As SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy start to dance, the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant pulls out two canes and hats and throws them up to them. The two sponges, past and present, put on a show on the rooftop and dance the night away. The police officer dance along as well. During the show, Spongy Spongy continues to imitate SpongeBob's dancing movements. SpongeBob's shoes come off and Spongy Spongy's feet come off and they both dance as well. The two sponges finish the show and everyone on the ground gives them a round of applause. Spongy Spongy swipes SpongeBob's shoes and goes to try them on. However, since his feet are too big and the shoes are too small, he growls in frustration and stomps on the roof.]
SpongeBob: Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!
[But it was too late. The City Hall's roof cracks and the building collapses to the ground. The police and Mr. Krabs walk up to SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy.]
SpongeBob: Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Nobody's gonna put him in jail son. He just saved the town millions by demolishing City Hall. It was due to come down next week.
SpongeBob: Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!
Spongy Spongy: [grunts as he walks around upside down with SpongeBob's shoes in his hands] Spongy Spongy. Spongy Spongy!
Perch Perkins: And so, the savage beast finally soothed, life in Bikini Bottom returns to normal...if only for this episode. This is Perch Perkins—[gets whacked in the head by Spongy Spongy's club] Ow! [groans] For Bikini Bottom News.
[Spongy Spongy looks at the camera, sniffs it and smashes it with his club, leaving a crack on the screen. The camera falls over and Spongy Spongy looks at it, ending the episode.]
