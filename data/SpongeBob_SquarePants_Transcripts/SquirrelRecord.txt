[The episode starts with the Krusty Krab at nighttime. The scene cuts to the interior, where we see Squidward sleeping at the counter with a magazine on his face, then an alarm clock rings, Squidward wakes up and stops it. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob about to flip a Krabby Patty and then Squidward pokes his head through the window.]
Squidward: It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home. [SpongeBob continues to flip the patty] Quitting time! [SpongeBob sniffs the patty, Squidward takes out a megaphone and shouts in it] Go home! [SpongeBob continues to ignore Squidward and flips the patty, he then looks at his watch]
SpongeBob: Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?
[Squidward gets frustrated and screams, running out of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [picking up the patty] What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away. [snaps his finger, laughs, and puts the patty inside his wallet, then a smelly odor flies in and SpongeBob sniffs it] Bleh! [the scene cuts to the garbage can where we can see the smelly odor is coming from] But I do have to throw away the trash.
[the scene cuts to the back of the Krusty Krab, the door opens and a big smelly smoke comes out followed by SpongeBob who is wearing a gas mask while holding the trash can, he walks over to the dumpster and dumps all the trash into it, then a book covered with trash comes up from the dumpster]
SpongeBob: [takes off his gas mask and picks up a book] What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books. [suddenly a big green slimy monster emerges from the dumpster. SpongeBob screams at the sight of it. He then throws the books at it, causing it to fall over. The slime dissolves to reveal that it was actually Sandy] Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?
Sandy: Heck no. I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin. It's all right here in The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book Of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records. [turns page] Look-e here, SpongeBob. Staring Record. 5 days. Most fries up nose. Holding your breath.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Sandy: Yes siree! I swear by the power of Texas, I'm gonna break all the records in this here book!
[the scene cuts to the treedome]
Sandy: What's the next challenge?
SpongeBob: Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue.
Sandy: Well, that's easy. [scene cuts to Sandy's tongue, SpongeBob is pulling Sandy's tongue] 106, 107...
SpongeBob: Hold tight, Sandy.
Sandy: ...108, 109, 110!
SpongeBob: That's it, Sandy! You did it!
Sandy: Yeehaw! [Sandy crashes into SpongeBob]
[the scene cuts to SpongeBob reading The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records]
SpongeBob: Let's see... Yikes! Sweet mother of Pearl!
Sandy: Is it dangerous?
SpongeBob: Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can.
Sandy: Chum, huh? That's not too bad.
SpongeBob: Raw!
Sandy: [sputters] Raw?!
[the scene cuts to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You want what?
SpongeBob: One order of chum, please.
Sandy: Raw.
Plankton: Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did.
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: For 30 seconds.
Plankton: Well, it's your funeral.
[the scene cuts back at the treedome, SpongeBob is in a toxic-proof suit. He grabs a spoon of chum and walks to Sandy who is cuffed]
SpongeBob: Ok, Sandy, eat up.
Sandy: Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh... [SpongeBob shoves the chum in Sandy's mouth. Sandy screams breaking free] Must! Make! World! Record!
SpongeBob: Sandy, you did it! You survived! [chicken clucks, SpongeBob sees Sandy lying on the floor] Uh, oh. Hold on, Sandy! [takes off helmet] I know just what you need! [SpongeBob gasps and reaches into his wallet to grab a Krabby Patty] A Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob puts the Krabby Patty in her mouth and helps her chew and she rises up like as a rooster crows, Sandy coughs and gasps]
Sandy: I did it! I'm alive! I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record breaking feats.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I forgot my camera!
Sandy: What?! SpongeBob! I need photographic proof of my amazing deeds!
SpongeBob: I'll go get the camera.
