Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer! [opens door] Welcome to art class!!
Nat: Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry... [everyone leaves except SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
Squidward: SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!
SpongeBob: [laughs] This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
Squidward: You're looking at him.
SpongeBob: You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
Squidward: Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Squidward: Well, art is not all fun and games. [as he picks up a big stack of books] It's a lot of hard... [he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air] ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: "I have no talent."
SpongeBob: I have no talent.
Squidward: "Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
SpongeBob: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Squidward: "If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me."
SpongeBob: If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. [smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say [draws a crooked circle] circle one. [laughs] Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: How's this, Squidward?
Squidward: What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
SpongeBob: Well, first I draw this head. [draws an amazing head] Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
Squidward: Gimme that. [crumples paper] Forget the circles.
SpongeBob: Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. [laughs] Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.
Squidward: Gimme that. [rips up paper] There is nothing artistic about leapfrog! [SpongeBob puts pieces together] What are you doing, now?
SpongeBob: I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time... [blows paper]
Squidward: Do you want to learn art, or not?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently... [hits marble with chisel; and it breaks into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: [hits marble with chisel and it becomes a perfect sculpture of Michelangelo's David] How's this Squidward?
Squidward: [starry-eyed] It's beautiful. [a tear falls from his eyes] I mean... this isn't a sculpture. [SpongeBob's lip starts quivering] A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. [SpongeBob wipes away a tear] Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. [Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture] There, now it's art.
SpongeBob: Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. [falls down and starts crying] I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. [crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward] I don't even deserve to use your doors! [the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first]
Monty: Hello, there!
SpongeBob: But I did deserve that. [the dumpster closes on top of him] I deserved that, too. [garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump] And I deserve this!
Monty: Good day, sir!
Squidward: Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
Monty: Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
Squidward: The world famous art collector?
Monty: The one and only.
Squidward: Well, what are you doing here?
Monty: I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
Squidward: Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: "Squidward en repose".
Monty: I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
Squidward: Why not?
Monty: Because. It's an art collection! [laughs]
Squidward: How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Monty: More like: Belongs in the Trash! [laughs]
Janitor: Sorry. I must've missed that one. [grabs the painting and throws it in the trash]
Monty: Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!
Squidward: Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Monty: Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. [removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head] Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...
Squidward: Fame! [Squidward imagines himself as popular]
Monty: ...fortune...
Squidward: Fortune! [Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money]
Monty: ...anything his heart desires!
Squidward: Anything?!?! [Squidward imagines himself with hair] It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!
Monty: I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
Squidward: I could use a little help. [sculptures head falls off and turns into dust] My fame! My fortune! My hair!
Monty: Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
Squidward: Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Monty: Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. [laughs]
Squidward: Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. [closes the door as Monty walks out] I gotta find SpongeBob! [at dump] SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
Squidward: Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. [he slides out of the cereal box] These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them. [SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can]
Squidward: Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really.
SpongeBob: Wow... [pause] Really?
Squidward: Let's go.
SpongeBob: [notices a painting in the dump] Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
Squidward: Gimme that. [back at classroom] Okay, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
SpongeBob: I... can't!
Squidward: Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!
SpongeBob: I did it, Squidward. [draws a crooked circle]
Squidward: Huh!? But-but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
Squidward: Uhh... [crumples paper] How about this, huh? Remember?
SpongeBob: That's not in the book, either.
Squidward: FORGET ABOUT THE BOOK!!! [grips the book and rips it] Ha! Look at all this mess, SpongeBob! [he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it] What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do!?
SpongeBob: Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it! [puts book back together] There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da! [Squidward's nose melts off his face]
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
SpongeBob: First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
Squidward: Now you've got it.
SpongeBob: I've gotta embrace the marble!
Squidward: Right.
SpongeBob: I've gotta sniff the marble!
Squidward: Well, uh, okay.
SpongeBob: I've gotta lick the marble!
Squidward: Uhh...
SpongeBob: [washes the marble in a washing machine] I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! [expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble] I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
Squidward: Here you go, buddy. [hands him sculpting tools]
SpongeBob: With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!
Squidward: Oh, boy... [SpongeBob taps marble with the chisel; it shatters into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: But, one more thing. [puts a stone nose shaped like Squidward's on it] There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. [Squidward shrieks with frustration and goes crazy, runs through the marble and kicks two marbles, eating a part of the marble, he takes paint, squeezes it, kicks a picture, destroys the marble into 4 pieces and destroys the other marbles] It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. [runs through the wall and down the road singing in the tune of the William Tell Overture] ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.♪
Monty: I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?!
Squidward: As of now, it's his responsibility. [puts hat on janitor's head] Good day to you, sir! [this is a reference to "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory", where Mr. Wonka tells Charlie and Grandpa Joe that they lost the contest by saying: "You get NOTHING!!! You lose! GOOD DAY, SIR!"]
[It is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it]
Monty: [to janitor] You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!
