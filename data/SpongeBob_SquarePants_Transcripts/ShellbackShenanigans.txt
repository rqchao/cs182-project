[episode starts at the Krusty Krab at night]
SpongeBob: [Flips sign from "open" to "closed] Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Closing time already?
SpongeBob: I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.
Mr. Krabs: Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?
Mr. Krabs: I thought those things ate mostly kibble.
SpongeBob: It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, did you forget?
Mr. Krabs: Probably.
SpongeBob: Tomorrow is "Bring Your Pet To Work" day!
Mr. Krabs: I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!
Squidward: [Stood in the doorway] Nice. [Walks away] REAL NICE!
SpongeBob: Umm... Can I buy that patty?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Sure.
SpongeBob: Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.
SpongeBob: Good idea! [Gives Mr. Krabs some change] Thanks again, Mr. Krabs! [Leaves, then pops out of nowhere] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:  Whoa, what?
SpongeBob: [speaking gibberish]
Mr. Krabs: What, what?!
SpongeBob: We're all out of Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Did you check the freezer?!
SpongeBob: I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!
Mr. Krabs: What about the freezer in the attic?
SpongeBob: We don't have an attic.
Mr. Krabs: No attic?!
SpongeBob: You sold it, remember?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.
[Plankton and Karen are spying on Krabs and SpongeBob from the Chum Bucket with a telescope]
Plankton: Now what are they saying, Karen? Karen?!
Karen: I have no idea.
Plankton: What? I thought you said you could read lips!
Karen: I can, but you took my telescope away!
[Plankton gives the telescope to Karen]
Mr. Krabs: [In the telescope] Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: A fresh batch?
Mr. Krabs: That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: Okay, now what's he saying?
Karen: He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: A fresh batch ofâ€”ooh, this is good. This is really good!
SpongeBob: When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Plankton: Okay, what'd he just say?
Karen: What?
Plankton: I said, "What'd he just say?"
Karen: He said, "What?"
Plankton: I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!
Karen: I know that, and I'm saying he said, "What?"!
Plankton: I know that! Wait... oh, he said, "What?".
Karen: Yes!
SpongeBob: Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!
Mr. Krabs: You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day.
SpongeBob: No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay. Just make sure he's healthy and clean!
Plankton: Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
[Bubbles change the scene showing SpongeBob's House]
SpongeBob: Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries. [Holds a bag and shakes it upside down. A plate of kelp fries falls out and Gary sniffs them] I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy those. [Gary gets scared and runs away while SpongeBob fills the bath tub] Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary? [Eats a kelp fry] Gary? [Walks in the kitchen] Gary?! [He sees Gary hiding under the counter] Gary, not again. Come out of there, it's dirty! [Grabs Gary] Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou.... [Tries to pull him out but accidentally trips and Gary flies into a pot on top of the refrigerator and is covered in mud]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [Upset] Great, Gary, just great. Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not gonna come down from there, are you?
Gary: Meow. [No]
SpongeBob: Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning. [Flicks off the light and leaves.. Bubbles change the scene. Gary hears a knock on the door and comes to answer it]
Plankton: [In a disguise wearing a wig and has a suitcase] Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
SpongeBob: [Offscreen] Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
Plankton: Look, I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
Gary: Meow.
Plankton: Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here![Opens suitcase and a large poster pops out] At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be...
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Gary! The bath is ready!
Plankton: ...all yours! Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered! [Shows Gary an orange inflatable shell] A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course.
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Gary! Your bath is ready!
[Gary immediately puts on the shell and leaves]
Plankton: Have a pleasant stay! Bon voyage! [Closes the door and takes off the disguise, goes into Gary's real shell, and puts small balls on his antennas, making him look like Gary. He laughs] If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!
SpongeBob: [Appears walking next to Plankton in the shell and mistakes him for Gary] Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear! [Picks him up and walks up the stairs] Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for "Bring your pet to work" day! And today is the day! [Goes to the bath tub and drops "Gary" in the tub] First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!
Plankton: Wha...? [Gets squirted with the gel and is covered in shampoo]
SpongeBob: Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?
Plankton: Ugh...
SpongeBob: [Takes "Gary" and holds him above his head] Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime! [Scrubs Plankton by dragging him back and forth like a sponge]
Plankton: [screams]
SpongeBob: [Stops scrubbing him] Bet that feels good, huh?
Plankton: [Coughs and Chokes] Curses! I mean... meow?
SpongeBob: [Nervous] Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?
Plankton: I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow! [Soap washes off and reveals his body to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Worried] Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
Plankton: No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: [Rushes down the stairs holding "Gary"] We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
Plankton: Pet hospital?! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
SpongeBob: You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick. [Bubbles change the scene showing the hospital. To Sadie] Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?
[Sadie takes a look at "Gary"]
Plankton: [Afraid she might notice it's him] Meow? [Sadie throws bottles of medicine on the ceiling while shrieking in horror]
SpongeBob: Is that yes? Or no?
Sadie: I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!
Plankton: Intensive care unit?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals.
[Bubbles change the scene and Plankton is sitting on a bed]
Plankton: [Sees a large computer, thinking it's Karen] Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
Sadie: [Walks in the room] Don't worry. We're just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it. [She pulls a curtains and we hear Plankton screaming in pain while the screen shows the hospital. SpongeBob breathes heavily thinking about "Gary"]
Jennifer-Millie: Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests.
Purple Doctorfish: [To Jennifer] That's not what I'm saying at all.
SpongeBob:  Oh, Gary! [crying]
Purple Doctorfish: [To SpongeBob] Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can. We just can't find out anything wrong with him. I've never seen anything like it.
SpongeBob: Please try to save him, doctor!
[Cut to Plankton]
Plankton: [Sleeps on the bed, then wakes up paranoid] No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...
Sadie: Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.
Plankton: Whew! That's a relief.
Sadie: [Takes out a giant pill bigger than Plankton] Now, open wide. [Plankton screams as Sadie puts the pill in his mouth]
Sadie: That wasn't so bad, was it? [Plankton has the pill in his mouth, tears up, and spits out the pill all over her] That's not good. [Cuts to SpongeBob still crying] Uh, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: [stops crying and heads over to "Gary" who is covered up in bandages] Gary!
Sadie: The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.
SpongeBob: You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh. [Sadie walks away] Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...[sniff]... the end. [wails]
Plankton: If I could just have a... [cough cough] Krabby Patty before I go...
SpongeBob: Sure thing, little buddy, sure. [sniffs] Y'know, it's... it's really poignant.
Plankton: What is?
SpongeBob: Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you! [continues wailing and crying]
Plankton: [sighs] Oh, boy...
[Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on]
Tourist: So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon.
SpongeBob: [Carrying "Gary"] Just a little further, Gare-Bare.
Gary: [Looks out window]
Plankton: Yes!
[Gary pulls busline angrily and slithers over to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [Puts "Gary" down on the floor next to the grill] Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear. [Walks away gloomily]
Plankton: Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!
[Gary slithers to Plankton angrily and growls at him]
Plankton: Mommy? Hey, wait!
[Gary beats Plankton up, while Mr. Krabs hears this, and he sees Plankton running out the door] 
Mr. Krabs: Plankton? [Finds out Gary beat him out of the restaurant and has an idea. Bubbles change the scene. Gary is at the Krusty Krab door letting people in, then Plankton, in a costume, comes up to Gary]
Plankton: Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare. [Gary Growls] Whoa, there, fido! [screams and runs away] I'm going! I'm going already!
SpongeBob: Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay.
Mr. Krabs: Well, he takes after you, boy. [surprised] Pay?!
