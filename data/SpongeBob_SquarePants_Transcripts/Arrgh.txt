Mr. Krabs: [Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope] Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
SpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?
SpongeBob: [laughs] There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty!
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: [chewing gum along with Patrick] I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Hahaha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Five! [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm... [SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired.
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]
Patrick: Boy, would I!
Mr. Krabs: [takes hat off Patrick's head] You're fired.
SpongeBob: My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door]  Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?! [rushes back to the game table] Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: [very tired] I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside his house after bringing Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...! [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
Mr. Krabs: Tread softly, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: [yelling in frustration] MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? Though it is treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives, and then the rooster crows everyone up.] Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: [excited] Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
Patrick: [Walks towards the plank with two separate eye patches covering his eyes] And I'm BlindBeard the Pirate! [falls on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [fade to ship sailing across in midair] Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... no. Only the captain can lay eyes on the map!
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then!
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then!" A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish flies by him] I mean... [standing up] ARRGH, Captain Krabs. [eyes widen and sees a rock nearby] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, ARRGH!
Patrick: I, ARRGH, think, ARRGH, he's trying, ARRGH, to say-- [crash] land.
Mr. Krabs: AAAARRGH!!! From now on, only the captain says 'arrgh'! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh. We're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. [later] This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way, cap'n?
Mr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
Patrick: Uhh... [pulls out a compass and visualizes it] let's see, uhh... [points] that way, captain!
Mr. Krabs: [cuts to the crew after walking] 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east!
Patrick: Ohhhh, east? I thought you said "weast".
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass are you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. [cuts to the crew walking again] 9,551... 9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew. And without a loyal crew... [one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] what am I captain of? Just a... bunch of sand! [cries]
Patrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks!
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours!
Patrick: ...I know, hehehehe. [SpongeBob moves away]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [entering the tent] Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: [walks toward the map] Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself! [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
SpongeBob and Patrick: THE MAP! THE MAP! GOTTA SEE IT, GOTTA LOOK AT IT! [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: [appearing right behind them and angry] Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream] Ahh! Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
Patrick: We're sorry!
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
[SpongeBob and Patrick both begged in mercy and then the “X” symbol appeared underneath them.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: [eyes go into "X" like symbol] "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? [Spongebob and Patrick both start digging.] Dig! Dig! [minutes later] Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!
SpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha! Hand it up to me, lads! Heave! [Brings treasure up] We finally found it! [opens up the treasure chest]
Female Chorus: The Dutchman's Treasure!
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one!
SpongeBob: And one for all!
Mr. Krabs: All for one!!
SpongeBob: And one for all!!
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman...
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman... [wakes up] WHO DARES WAKE THE FLYING DUTCHMAN?! Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep. [noticing them fighting over treasure chest] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. [Lightning]
Flying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure???
Mr. Krabs: [shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick] They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! [picks up the treasure chest] So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hugging each other in fear] Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
[The Flying Dutchman giving them couple of gold doubloons]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Female Chorus: Two gold doubloons!
[SpongeBob and Patrick take the doubloons and the Flying Dutchman puts away his treasure chest in his pocket.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. [Flicks something to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold! [a tiny plastic treasure chest] Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!
Female Chorus: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest! [laughs and disappears out of sight]
Patrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.]
