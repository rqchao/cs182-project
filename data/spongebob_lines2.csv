SpongeBob Lines
"Mrs. Puff:  Now, SpongeBob, what is the proper procedure for making a right turn?"
"SpongeBob:  Hold on, I'll check the textbook.  Ah, Your Mirror and You. Hmm, proper seat belt hygiene? No."
Mrs. Puff: Assuming crash position.
Mrs. Puff:  We didn't crash!
SpongeBob:  Hooray!
"SpongeBob:  Mrs. Puff! Oh, there you are.  I'll make it up to you, Mrs. Puff. I'll shine your shoes!  Dry your hair!  Oil your boat?"
"Mrs. Puff:  SpongeBob, stop it! ENOUGH!  Well, you could clean up all this junk. I've been tossing stuff in this old lighthouse for 20 years!"
SpongeBob:  I love cleaning!
"Mrs. Puff:  Uh-huh, glad to hear it. I'll be in my classroom.  Oh, and if you need me...  ...don't."
SpongeBob:  That takes care of that.  Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.
"SpongeBob: Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern.  The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster."
SpongeBob:  That box is haunted!  These stairs are haunted!  This trash is haunted.
Louie:  Meow.
SpongeBob:  Ahh! Ghost snail!
Louie:  Meow.
"SpongeBob:  Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie!"
"Louie:  Meow, meow!"
"SpongeBob:  Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans."
"Louie:  Meow, meow.  Meow."
"SpongeBob:  Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety.  What! Louie?  Well, that oughta keep you out of my HAIR!"
"Louie:  Meow, meow!"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside.  No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain!   And the bait: one can-o-patty."
Louie:  Meow!
"SpongeBob:  Gotcha!  I don't gotcha.  You got me.  Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh?  Huh, where'd Louie go?  Louie! Louie! Louie!"
Louie:  Meow.
"SpongeBob:  Louie! So this is where you've been hiding?  Nice snail, good Louie!  No, no..."
"Larry:  Woah, those dudes are huge! I wonder what they lift."
Bubble Bass:  Those aren't dudes. They're giant monsters! Everybody panic!
Larry:  Those buff monsters have vanished!  We're saved!
Bubble Bass: We're doomed!  My cheeks!
Perch Perkins: Can you please tell our viewers the cause of this destruction?
"Fred:  It was a lighthouse. It rolled through town, destroying everything in its path!  A LIGHTHOUSE!"
Perchy Perkins:  My goodness. Were you or YOUR LEGS injured by this insane lighthouse?
Fred:  No.
Mr. Krabs:  That blasted lighthouse is gonna demolish me Krusty Krab!  Attention loyal customers!
Paco: Run for our lives?
"Mr. Krabs: No, throw your bodies in front of that lighthouse, and protect me restaurant!"
"SpongeBob:  No, not the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Stay away from me restaurant, you dirty... er... lighthouse!"
SpongeBob:  Must... stop... lighthouse.
"Mr. Krabs:  Ha-ha, and don't come back!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, you came back."
"SpongeBob:  Louie? Where's Louie?  Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning!  You were just protecting your cute little babies.  I guess I should call you Louise instead!"
"Mrs. Puff:  You actually did a good job, SpongeBob! You deserve a gold star!"
"SpongeBob:  Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff.  These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse."
Mrs. Puff:  Aren't you adorable?
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!"
"SpongeBob:  See you next week, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mrs. Puff:  Amazing. For once, SpongeBob didn't create a huge disaster!"
Mr. Krabs:  Puff! Your blasted lighthouse destroyed the whole town!  And me restaurant!
Mrs. Puff:  My lighthouse?!
The entire mob: What are you going to do about it?!
Mrs. Puff:  Talk to the fin!
Debbie: Price check on industrial size econo pack of raw fiber.
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven."
"Debbie:  Please, tell me more."
"Mr. Krabs: Ooh, well, this one time I..."
Debbie: Not really!
"Mr. Krabs: I didn't think so. Ooh, wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there, too."
"Debbie: Sir, these expired over 30 years ago."
Mr. Krabs: What does that mean?
"Debbie: It means they're no good, sir. I'll just throw those away for you."
"Mr. Krabs: No, wait! I'll take 'em."
"Debbie: Okay, sir, your change today is going to be exactly ten cents."
"Mr. Krabs: Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well, I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago."
SpongeBob:  Sir... Sir!
Debbie: ...Sir!
Mr. Krabs: What?
Debbie: You're holding up the line.
"Mr. Krabs:  Ooh, I am?"
"Debbie: Next, please."
"Mr. Krabs: Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work!"
"Billy: Hey, mommy, look at that weird guy in the car over there."
"Billy's Mom: Billy, mommy's watching the road right now."
"Mr. Krabs: I mean, why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs, too, you know!  How about a little music.  Okay, okay, get a grip, Krabs. Just concentrate on driving.  Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin.  Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second.  I GOTTA, HAVE THAT, PENNYYYYYYYY!!!  Good morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: Find anything special lately?
SpongeBob: Yae-yes!
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: Yup!
"Mr. Krabs: And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you, boy?"
SpongeBob: Of course!
"Mr. Krabs: Great! Well, share it with me!"
"SpongeBob:  I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: Wha.. What?
"SpongeBob: The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!"
Squidward: Don't talk to me.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.
Squidward: That counts as talking.
"SpongeBob: Whoa! Hello again, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Hello, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob: What can I do you for?
Mr. Krabs: Can I borrow a penny?
"SpongeBob: A penny? Sure.  Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now."
Mr. Krabs: But did you check all your pockets?
"SpongeBob: Well, I thought I did."
Mr. Krabs: Front pockets?
"SpongeBob: Hmm, no."
Mr. Krabs: Back?
SpongeBob: Hmm-mm.
Mr. Krabs: Shirt pockets?
SpongeBob: Nuh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: Shoe pockets?
"SpongeBob:  Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous."
Mr. Krabs: It is?
"SpongeBob: Well, I do have a tie pocket though.  No, not in there either."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, maybe it fell in your sock."
"SpongeBob: Well, I..."
Mr. Krabs: Did you check there?  Uhh?
"SpongeBob: Hey, look, it's my brain!  Hey, where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Ugh!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here."
Mr. Krabs: Uhh?
"SpongeBob: What's the matter, Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?"
"Mr. Krabs: So, uhh, no penny, huh?"
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Darn!
"SpongeBob: Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working."
"Squidward: Me, too."
SpongeBob: Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
Squidward: Never.
SpongeBob: The sounds are coming from back here. What the?
Mr. Krabs: Careful with those marquee ladders!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!"
"Mr. Krabs: Yes, I did."
SpongeBob: Yay!
"Mr. Krabs: And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up, folks, and witness a spellbinding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills..."
"Frank: You know, I'm not really hungry."
"Fred: Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about."
Mr. Krabs: ...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
Fred: By who?
Mr. Krabs: by a... by a plucky young sponge.
SpongeBob: Just like me!
Mr. Krabs: That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!
Squidward: Does a movie like that even exist?
"Fred: Yeah, does it?!"
"Mr. Krabs: Uhh, well, actually, I was going to show you this flip book and..."
Squidward: A flip book?
"Fred: Yeah, I don't even know what that is!"
"Mr. Krabs: No, wait. Noooooooo!"
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?"
"Mr. Krabs: Of course you can, lad!  You just gotta give me one penny."
"SpongeBob: But, but..."
Mr. Krabs: But what?
"SpongeBob: But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie.  Oh, well."
"Squidward: Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night."
SpongeBob: Squidward? You look beautiful!
Squidward: Let me show you to your table.
SpongeBob: My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag!
"Mr. Krabs: Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one."
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:  Yes?
SpongeBob: I would like to donate a penny.
Mr. Krabs: You would?
SpongeBob: If I only had one!
"Mr. Krabs: Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it."
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: What's that? You! You know where!
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: Tell where!
Gary: Meow.
"Mr. Krabs: Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere."
SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny."
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't?
"SpongeBob: No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint."
"Mr. Krabs: Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!"
"SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah, well, good night, Gary."
"Mr. Krabs: Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging."
"Pearl: Boy, do I love high school. . You know what? Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... Remember?"
"Pearl's friend:  Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?"
Pearl:  Of course I didn't forget. I'm so excited.
"Pearl's friend:  Me, too!"
Pearl's friend:  Barnacle!
Pearl: What!?
Pearl's friend: Pearl I'm gonna say this as touchily as possible.  There is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face!
Pearl:  Where!?
Pearl's friend: There!
"Pearl's friend: Pearl, it's not really bad as you..."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob:  Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: Didn't you already mop this area?
"SpongeBob:  Affirmative, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, then, why would you mop it again?"
SpongeBob: Why wouldn't I?
Mr. Krabs: Good point.
"Mr. Krabs: Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?"
"Pearl: Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend."
"Mr. Krabs: Oooh, that is terrible.  Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!"
"Pearl: No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!"
Mr. Krabs:  Why ever not?
Pearl: Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you...  Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!"
"Pearl: We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!"
Mr. Krabs: Anything for me beloved angel!
"Pearl: Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of..."
"Mr. Krabs: I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund."
Harold: You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.
Nat: I heard they have better weather over there.
"Mr. Krabs:  No! Wait!  This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream."
SpongeBob:
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  At ease!  How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?"
"SpongeBob: I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!"
"Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!"
"SpongeBob: Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!"
Pearl: Are you sure?
"SpongeBob: One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again."
Pearl: How?
SpongeBob: I took him to see a hypnotist.
Pearl: You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
SpongeBob: No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
Pearl: I thought you said it was a barnacle.
SpongeBob: What did I say?
Pearl: Pelican.
SpongeBob:  He was a really good hypnotist.
SpongeBob: Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
Pearl: Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
SpongeBob:  Hypnosis? No! Hold still now.
Pearl: Is everything okay?
SpongeBob:  I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work!
Pearl: Did it come off?
SpongeBob:  Gettin' there.
"Pearl: SpongeBob, how much longer?"
"SpongeBob: Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like."
Pearl: Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
SpongeBob: Okay.
"SpongeBob:  Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?"
Pearl: There's more!
"SpongeBob:  I mean, you're right. There's more."
Pearl:  All I did was wash with soap and water!
SpongeBob:  Hmm... Water and... this soap?
"Pearl: Yes, but why?"
"SpongeBob:  Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?"
Pearl: No.
SpongeBob:  More for me!
"SpongeBob:  No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing."
"Mr. Krabs:  Pearl, I'm home!"
"SpongeBob: Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewels!"
"SpongeBob: Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever."
Pearl:  I'm not going to the dance!
"SpongeBob: Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano."
Pearl: And what exactly would that do to me?
"SpongeBob: I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!"
Pearl: How?
"SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again."
Pearl:
SpongeBob: Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
"Pearl: In the basement. Duh, where else?"
SpongeBob:  Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!
"Mr. Krabs: Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?"
"Mr. Krabs: Why, it's my old soap press!"
SpongeBob: Soap press?
"Mr. Krabs: That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!"
SpongeBob: Leftover Krabby Patties?
"Mr. Krabs:  Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free."
"SpongeBob:  Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you..."
Pearl:  I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty essence.
Pearl: That's grease!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose-"
Pearl:  Daddy!
"Mr. Krabs:  Got to go, you kids have fun!"
Pearl:  I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?"
"Pearl:  The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-"
"SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!"
Pearl: Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
"SpongeBob: Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea..."
Pearl: Are you done yet?
"SpongeBob:  All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  And, ta-da. What do you think?"
"Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?"
SpongeBob:  We shall see shortly.
Pearl: Are you sure?
SpongeBob:  Shh. Trust me.
"Blue fish: Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the- wow! Pearl, you look amazing!"
Pearl: I do?
"Blue fish: Well, not amazing. Sparkly and shiny and amazing!"
Pearl: Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Pearl and her friends:  Let's go!
"SpongeBob: You have a good time, carefree teens!"
"Mr. Krabs:  My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?"
SpongeBob: Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Mr. Krabs: Help! Police! Thief!  Stop that whale!
"SpongeBob: I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise."
"Squidward:  SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? . SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low.  Why are you grilling index cards?"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted.  I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow."
"Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!"
"SpongeBob: Okay! Okay!  Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday."
"SpongeBob: No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes!  Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!"
Squidward:  Must I do everything myself?  Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn.
SpongeBob: I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything.
"Patrick: Oh, sorry, wrong rock."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes."
Patrick: Okay.  Uhhh...
"SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here.  Just pretend you're a student at his desk."
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob:
"Patrick: H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class."
"SpongeBob: Okay, here goes.  Boating safety is..."
"Patrick: SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?"
"SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice."
Patrick: Fine.
SpongeBob:  Boating safe...
Patrick: Boring! Next!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?"
"Patrick: All right, all right."
"SpongeBob: So, without further ado...  Patrick?  Patrick, wake up.  What happened, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?"
SpongeBob: I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
Patrick: Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
SpongeBob: Worse?
Patrick: You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
SpongeBob: Okay.  Boating safety...  Boating safe...
Patrick: That's it!  Fight through!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!"
Patrick: Says you! Speech!
SpongeBob: Boating safe...
"Patrick:  SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom."
"SpongeBob: Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick."
"Patrick:  Young man, how dare you?!"
"SpongeBob: What, a detention slip?"
Patrick:  I'm not hearing your oral report.
SpongeBob: Okay.  Boating safe...
Patrick: Try again.
SpongeBob:  Boating safety...
"Patrick: Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working."
Patrick:  Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Spee -
"SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything."
"Patrick: Yeah, you do look pretty terrible."
"SpongeBob: Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license!"
"Patrick: Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one."
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!"
"Patrick: Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya."
"Sandy: Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!"
SpongeBob:
Sandy: It has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.
"Sandy: Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these.  Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license."
SpongeBob: That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working.
"Sandy: Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick."
"SpongeBob:  Eh! Ooh, they work."
Billy: ...and they were never heard from again.
"Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have--  --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh."
"Patrick:  Go on, buddy."
SpongeBob:
"Mrs. Puff: Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?"
SpongeBob:  Huh...?
Mrs. Puff: The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready!  I can do it.  Um...  Oh, no. Oh, no!"
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing?!
"SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?"
Mrs. Puff: No. Only if you want to pass this class!
"SpongeBob: Okay.  Uh, my report...is on...  Heh! Must be last-minute jitters!  Patrick, where are those goggles?"
Patrick: Right here. Let me polish them up for ya.  Here ya go.
SpongeBob: Thanks!
Billy: Hurry up!
"SpongeBob:  Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ..."
"Mrs. Puff: What's all this laughing about?  Well, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob:  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because --
"Scary Face: Well, don't just stand there! Get on with it!"
SpongeBob:  They're all staring!
"Patrick: Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait!  SpongeBob!"
Mrs. Puff: You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!
"Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob!"
Mrs. Puff: Get back here with my boat!
"Police Officer: I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?"
"Police Officer #2: You said it, partner! My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker."
SpongeBob:
"Police Officer: Okay, forget what I just said."
"Police Officer: Sponge, pull over!"
SpongeBob: I don't know how!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
"Police Officer: All right, kid, what was that all about?"
Police Officer #2: Don't you know anything about boating safety?
"SpongeBob:  Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do.  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--"
"Police Officer #2: Gee, kid.  That was beautiful."
Police Officer: Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.
Mrs. Puff: Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"Police Officer: Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?"
Mrs. Puff:   Yes. Why?
"Police Officer: Under penal code 26-1 quote, The boating instructor is responsible--"
SpongeBob: --for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care.
"Police Officer: Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am."
Mrs. Puff: What?! Nooo!
"Patrick: Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing."
"SpongeBob: Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!"
"Patrick: Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh!"
"Scary Face: And, what are you lookin' at?"
Patrick:
Plankton:  Yes! My plan is working!  Now everyone in town will know what a jerk Krabs is. Yeah!  Huh?
"Lady officer: Hey, you!  You're under arrest."
Plankton: Arrest? For what? I didn't even steal anything this time.
"Mr. Krabs: Vandalism's a crime too. You've been caught red-handed, Plankton."
"Plankton: Eh, should've used the green paint."
"Mr. Krabs: I usually laugh all the way to the bank.  But for you, Plankton, I'll laugh all the way to the clink!"
"Lady officer: Oh no, the prison is full!  Looks like we'll just have to set you free."
"Mr. Krabs:  What, free?! But he's a criminal!"
"Lady officer: Well, you know what they say. Don't stop the crime if you can't enforce the time."
"Plankton:  Eat it, Krabs! I'm off to re-offend."
Lady officer: It's a shame that there's no other place in Bikini Bottom to hold our extra criminals. 'Cause we'd give that place a lot of money.
"Mr. Krabs:  You got yourself a deal!  We can lock him up at my place,  the Krusty Krab."
"Lady officer: Well then,  this is for the prisoner.  And here's your cash."
"Mr. Krabs:  Whoa.  Thank you, Madame Officer."
"Squidward: Oh, stupid barnacles, tartar sauce, fish paste—"
"Mr. Krabs:  Enjoy your ride, Plankton?"
Squidward: Ow.
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, sorry, Mr. Squidward. Didn't see you there."
"SpongeBob: Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison."
Mr. Krabs: He is. The Krusty Krab is a prison now.
"SpongeBob:  Oh, hooray! Prison!"
"Squidward:  Oh, big deal. I've been a prisoner here for years."
"Mr. Krabs:  Hardy-har, Mr. Squidward.  You boys get back to work!  I'll be guarding Plankton in me office.  Into your cell, you miscreant!"
"Plankton:  All right, I'm out of here.  Uh, pardon me, warden, sir, but is that a pretty penny on the floor?"
Mr. Krabs:  Where? It's mine! It's mine! I saw it first!
Plankton:  The perfect escape.  YEEOOWW!!!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't.  Trying to escape is bad enough, but lying about a penny? You're going in...  ...the hole.  Need one of your holes, boy-o."
"SpongeBob:  You got it, Warden Krabs."
"Plankton: Hey, let's not do anything we can't—"
Mr. Krabs: And don't let him go nowhere!
"SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!"
"Plankton:  All right, who turned off the lights?"
"SpongeBob:  Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me."
Mr. Krabs: That oughta learn him.
"Lady officer: Morning, Warden."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, me favorite paying police lady. Here to give me more money?"
"Lady officer: Yup, more money for more prisoners."
Mr. Krabs: More prisoners?
"Prisoner #1: Aye, the Krusty Krab. I used to eat here."
Prisoner #2: What a coincidence. I used to rob here.
"Lady officer: So, what do you say, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs:  I say... lock 'em up!  SpongeBob! Try to prison-up the place for our new guests. I gotta go incarcerate all this cash.
"SpongeBob: I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Nice work, boy-o. Very prison-y."
"Fred: Hey, uh, what's with all the caged men in here?  They're making me a little nervous...!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ooh, um, well we're a prison-themed restaurant now.  Do your time with our new Prison Patty.  It's served in a solitary confinement box, has its own prisoner number, and even comes with toy shackles!"
Fred: Wow!
Prisoner #3:  Looks delicious.
"Mr. Krabs: At the Krusty Krab, you can lock up your hunger and throw away your keys!  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ooh, crisis averted. Okay, time to let Plankton out of the hole. Open her up, boy-o.  Hmm.  Pull yourself together, prisoner!  I got a new cell for you."
"Plankton:  The formula?! It's so close... I can almost touch it! No, no, no, no!"
Mr. Krabs:  Good times. Good times.
"SpongeBob: Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have?  Toothy.  Four Eyes.  Lefty.  Fats.  Fingers.  Einstein.  Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky."
"Prisoners: Thanks, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: No problem, guys."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, morning, officer."
Lady officer: I'm here to oversee Plankton's release.  His sentence is up.
Mr. Krabs: What?! But I have so many more punishments for him!
"Plankton:  Enjoy your Plankton-free prison, Eugene.  I hope it's worth what you're paying for it."
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Paying for it? Wonder what he means by that. Huh?
"SpongeBob: More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles?"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?!  Do you have any idea how much it costs to make a prison humane?! These down comforters, they're two-y.  This ain't no luxury hotel!  These televisions ain't free!  And neither are these massage chairs!  And this, your most expensive mistake of all!  From now on, no more patties for prisoners!"
Dorsal Dan: Cruel and unusual punishment!
Mr. Krabs: And no more tomatoes either!
"Female customer: Come on, let's find another prison to eat at."
Customers:  What a rip-off! / Come on.
"Mr. Krabs: No, no! Come back! Come back! I can't afford to lose me paying customers. Oh, I'm ruined!  All right, that's it!  No more prison! Everyone out!  Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here!  Oh, finally. The Krusty Krab is back to being a regular old money-making restaurant.  Problem solved.  I said problem solved!"
French Narrator: Later at night...
"SpongeBob: Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?"
Prisoner #4: We want to go back to the Krusty Krab. We were having fun in there with you. See?
"SpongeBob:  Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in."
French Narrator: The next day...
"Prisoners: Morning, Warden Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: Morning, prisoners!  SpongeBob! What is going on here? I set all these criminals free last night! What are they doing back in their cells?!"
"SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—"
"Lady officer: You know it's a crime to release prisoners early, don't ya?  You're going to prison,  criminal."
"Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, well, that's not so bad. Pencil me in for a 3:30 massage, SpongeBob."
"Lady officer:  Oh, you're not staying here. The Krusty Krab is full. We got a new prison just for you."
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, no... Let me guess..."
"Plankton: Mealtime, prisoner!  Right in the mouth."
"Narrator: The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing,  and it's time for the traditional..."
"SpongeBob: Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?"
Gary: Meow!
"SpongeBob: Thanks for your help, Gare!"
Gary: Meow!
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?"
Patrick: It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!
"Patrick: Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!  See ya again next spring.  Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah."
"Patrick: Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value.  You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities."
"SpongeBob: Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories.  No!  Come on, you!  Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories.  Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?"
Gary: Meow!
"SpongeBob:  Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special."
"Squidward: Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment."
SpongeBob: You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.
"SpongeBob: Oh, perfect!  Ah, memories. Greasy memories."
"SpongeBob: Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!"
Squidward: You're sentimental about your sweat?
"SpongeBob: Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!"
"Squidward: Okay, this is getting creepy now."
"SpongeBob: Oh, well, better get these precious memories home."
Squidward: Officially creeped out now.
"SpongeBob: ♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪  Hey, Gary.  Oh. Safe and sound!  Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit."
"Gary: Meow, meow, meow."
"SpongeBob: Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything."
SpongeBob: Like the front yard!
SpongeBob: Who is it?
Squidward: It's Squidward.
SpongeBob: How do I know it's you?
"Squidward: Open the door, nitwit!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?"
Squidward: You can certainly help...  Why are you wearing garbage?
"SpongeBob: Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning."
"Squidward: Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police."
"SpongeBob: Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy,  Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?!  You will be missed."
"Squidward: Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call."
Cop 1: Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.
"Squidward: Thank goodness you're here, officer."
Cop: Is this your filthy home?
"Squidward: No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!"
SpongeBob: Hi!
"Cop 1: Thanks for the information, citizen."
"Cop 2:  Hmph, snitch."
"Cop 1: Do your duty, Sergeant."
Cop 2:
Cop 1: This residence is now comdemned.
SpongeBob: Condemned? What does that mean?
Cop 1: Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.
SpongeBob: Vacate? You mean I have to move?
Cop 1: Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sergeant.
Cop 2:
"Squidward: Thank you again, officers."
SpongeBob: Wait! Please don't condemn my house.
"Squidward: Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow."
Cop 1: I'll request a commendation for you.
Squidward: Really?
Cop 1: Right after we condemn your house!
Squidward: My house?!
Cop 1: Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's.
SpongeBob: But isn't there anything we can do?
Cop 1: You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.
SpongeBob: Throw them away?
"Cop 1: Thank you for the attempt, ma'am."
Squidward: Ma'am? It's a nightshirt!  This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!
SpongeBob: I know.  I'm gonna miss them so much!
Squidward: You really miss them?
SpongeBob: No. I'll be strong.
"Squidward: Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away."
"SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!"
Squidward: Creepy.
"Squidward:  Oh, good grief."
"SpongeBob: Your pay, my good man."
"SpongeBob:  Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump!"
"Squidward: Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed."
"SpongeBob: Alright, nighty-night."
"Squidward: Idiot.  What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house."
Patrick: Nice dress.
Squidward:  It's a nightshirt!
Patrick: Batter up!
"SpongeBob:  Ah, oh."
"Patrick: I got it, I got it!"
SpongeBob:  Wah!
Patrick: Whoo-hoo!
Squidward: What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!
"SpongeBob: Just treasuring our time together, Squidward."
"Squidward: Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!"
Patrick:  I can't do it! I can't be away from my best friend!
"SpongeBob:  No, it hurts too much!"
"Squidward: Oh, will you two cut it out?"
"SpongeBob: Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!"
Squidward and Patrick: It is?
Patrick: Wow! My turn!
Squidward: I think I'm gonna be sick!
"SpongeBob:  Here you go, Patrick. Now we never have to be apart,  even when we're not together."
"Patrick: This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, see you forever, Patrick.  Time for bed, Tiny Patrick."
Patrick: Hmm.
Teddy Bear: Uh.  Oh.
Mini Patrick:  Ah.  Ah!
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward."
Squidward: Says who?
"SpongeBob:  You sit right there, my hungry little sailor, while I whip you up some grub from the galley."
"Mini Patrick:  Dah, uh-huh."
Mini Patrick: Ah.
Mini Patrick: Ahh. Hmm?  Ahhh! Yah!
"SpongeBob: Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot."
Mini Patrick:  Ohhh.
SpongeBob:  Huh?
Mini Patrick:  Whee-ah!
"SpongeBob: Stop!  Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm.  Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done.  Ah-yah."
Patrick: Good morning.
Patrick: Didn't think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did!
"SpongeBob:  Brushy, brushy, brushy."
"Patrick: Come on, Tiny SpongeBob. You gotta lift with your back."
"Patrick: Oh, oh. Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, hi."
Patrick:  Eeh.  Hmm. Hmm.
"SpongeBob: So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here."
"Patrick: Oh, yeah, well, me and Tiny SpongeBob,  we're pretty busy tonight, so good night."
SpongeBob: Good night.
"SpongeBob: I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam."
Mini Patrick: Ahh!
"Patrick: Huh? Hey. Didn't you used to have one two...two arms? Okay, little buddy. Let's find that arm of yours. Oh.  Oh.  Nope.  Nope. Hmm.  Huh?"
Mini SpongeBob: Ah!
Patrick: Nope.  Oh. Ah-ha! I got it!  I'll fix you up in no time.  Good as new.
Mini SpongeBob: Ehh. Huh?
"Patrick: Okay, good night."
Mini SpongeBob: Huh?
Mini SpongeBob: Oh?
Mini SpongeBob: Ding!  Yah!
"SpongeBob:  Yes, Squidward, extra mayo, I heard you."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, hi, Patrick."
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob: I don't remember us having a sleepover last night.
"Patrick: What's going on, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, hey, little guys. You're playing with each other. So cute."
Mini SpongeBob: Whew.
Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick: Huh?
"Mini SpongeBob: Ah, ah."
Mini SpongeBob: Hey!
"Patrick: What are they doing, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives."
SpongeBob: Poor little guys.
"SpongeBob: Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea."
"Patrick: Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula."
"SpongeBob: You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick."
"Patrick: Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob: Ta-da! A tiny house for my tiny friend.
Mini SpongeBob: Ahh!
"Patrick: Oh, I get it!"
"SpongeBob: Nice work, Patrick. Whoops!  Almost forgot.  You've got to have a Gare-Bear."
"Mini SpongeBob: Oh, yay!"
Mini Patrick: Ohh.  Huh?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww.  Hmm.
Patrick: Hmm?
"SpongeBob: Let's leave 'em alone, Patrick."
"Squidward:  Ah, too bright.  Oh, those two again!"
Squidward: What the—
Squidward: Ow!
"Squidward: No, get away. Get away!"
"SpongeBob:  This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick.  There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over."
Patrick:  Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes.  She's doing the old granny knot.
"Old Lady: Oh, I'll give you a granny knot!"
Patrick:  All clear! No crime here.
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP!  Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close."
"Patrick:  I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!"
"Squidward:  I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!"
Squidward: I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons.
SpongeBob:  Thank you.
SpongeBob:  Let me help you carry this.
"Squidward: No—wait, no!"
SpongeBob:  Oh—your unmentionables.
Patrick: I won't mention this bra.
Squidward: It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh...
"Squidward:  While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him!"
SpongeBob:  This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. I've got a visual on a cab. Can you get a make on who the passenger is? Over.
Patrick:  I can't see anything through these unmentionables.
"TV Announcer: Who's this tacky tourist turning up in taxi? Why, it's none other than that mortal enemy of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, the evil Man Ray!"
"Man Ray: Hey, dude, keep it down. I'm not doing any evil this week. I'm on vacation!"
TV Announcer: Really?
"Man Ray: Yes, really."
"SpongeBob: Aw, he went inside! Patrick, wouldn't it be great to have another friend who could join our Junior Crime Breakers? Ooh, I gotta get a look at him!"
Patrick:  We can blast him out.
"SpongeBob: No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man.  So, we gotta be sneaky."
SpongeBob: Shh! He must've gone upstairs.
"Patrick: Well, how do we get up there?"
SpongeBob: Eye have just the thing!  Ow!
"Man Ray:  Oh, it's getting chilly."
SpongeBob:  Ow!  D'ow!  Ow!  Oof!  Ow.
"SpongeBob: Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie."
Man Ray:  Oh! May I help you? I was just finishing up in the bathroom.
SpongeBob:  Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood!
Patrick: Don't mind us.
Man Ray: Wha...Hmm.
Man Ray: Is this sand?
Patrick: Hamper sand—from my hamper.
Man Ray:  Ugh!
"SpongeBob: Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit."
Patrick: SpongeBob. He's not putting out any snacks for us.
"Man Ray: Oh, sorry! How rude of me. Hmm...ooh! All I have is this pie."
Patrick: Don't mind if I do.
"Man Ray: Eh—if you'll excuse me, I'll finish up in the bathroom."
Patrick:  He's all outta snacks!  Let's go.
"SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—"
Patrick:  Evil villain Man Ray.
"Man Ray: Now, what were you saying?  Hmm? What? Hmm?  Hmm."
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! It's Man Ray! He's right inside Squidward's...place.  Too late. Man Ray must've gotten to them.
Patrick:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy ice pops! They finally made them!
"SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week!  Patrick, do you know what this means?"
Patrick: I'll have to wait a week for my Mermaid Man ice pop?
"SpongeBob: Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of... Evil!"
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star unite!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, is that..."
Patrick: I couldn't wait a week!  Yow!
Patrick: Ah-ah-ah—
"Patrick: Good thing I'm so stealthy, huh, Mermaid Pants?  Ah! The stealth!"
Man Ray:  Huh?  Hmm?  Hmm!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Man Ray: Intruders? Mm-hmm...I've got to call the cops.  What am I doing? Villains don't call the police!  I didn't think to bring any evil super-weapons on vacation! I'm unarmed!  Huh?
"SpongeBob:  Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons?  So stale, yet so deadly."
Patrick: I got my weapon!
SpongeBob:  ♪Dum-dah-dah!♪
"Man Ray: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? I knew you guys were old, but I had no idea you mutated."
"SpongeBob: Surrender, Man Ray!"
Man Ray: I'm on holiday.
"SpongeBob: Yeah, an evil holiday!"
Patrick: Prepare to be framed!
TV Announcer: Vase vaporized!
SpongeBob: Here's a dessert that's sure to hurt!
Man Ray: Huh?
TV Announcer: Figurines fractured!
"Patrick: No, no, no, no, no!"
"SpongeBob: All right, Man Ray. I will snare you in my clara-net!"
Man Ray:  Oof!
Patrick:  Uh...I can't think of anything!
TV Announcer: Table toppled!
Man Ray: I just wanted a vacation!
SpongeBob: Evil never takes a vacation!
Man Ray:  Did you just make that up? Because that sounds pretty good. Do you mind if I use it sometime?
"SpongeBob: Help yourself, Man Ray."
"Patrick: Yeah, help yourself to pain!"
Man Ray:  Why did I ever bother trying to be normal?  I am Man Ray! Feel my evil wrath!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Man Ray: Huh?"
Man Ray: Hold on. I should get this.  Hello?
"Squidward: Hello, Man Ray? The weather changed my plans. I'm coming home.  Not to worry, though. You'll get a full refund on the rent, so long as there is no damage to my place.  Hello?"
"Man Ray:  That idiot octopus doesn't know I gave him a phony check!  You were right about me after all, dopey duo. Evil never takes a vacation!"
SpongeBob: Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it.
"Man Ray:  Ah, here's my Scuber."
SpongeBob: Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers.  Huh?
"Patrick: Man, he really trashed this place."
"SpongeBob: Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!"
"Patrick: Well, how do we do that?"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14.  We have super saliva!"
Patrick:  Ow!
"Squidward: Hello?  Oh, looks like my guest left already.  Home sweet...  Home."

"Dr. Charley Horse:  Hmm. Uh-huh.  You're right, Fred. It's so tense. But I've got just the remedy. Take off your shoes and follow me."
Patrick:  So far this plan stinks.
"SpongeBob: This is no time to be smelling stinks, Patrick. I need to protect Fred's leg! (39) And I can't do it alone."
Dr. Charley Horse: The only way to relax your leg! (40) Is to walk on...  hot coals.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hot coals?!
"Dr. Charley Horse: Now Fred, close your eyes, and repeat after me the ancient mantra: My feet (41) are cold. My feet (42) are cold."

Fred: Whoa!  MY BUTT! (48)
"Dr. Charley Horse:  Oh my feet (49) are cold, my feet (50) are cold, my feet (51) are cold, my feet (52) are cold!  Transcendence."
Fred: Oooohhhh!
SpongeBob:  All quiet on the right side.
"Patrick:  All quiet on the left side.  Sorry, sir."
Old woman: Oh!
"SpongeBob: Sorry, ma'am."
"Fred: Hey, what's going on here?"
Girl Scout: Would you like to buy some cookies?
"SpongeBob: Mayday, Chicken Leg! (53) (41) We got a situation on the griddle!"
Patrick:  I got the weapon!  Yow!
Fred: SpongeBob? Why are you following MY LEG?! (54) (27)  (42)
"SpongeBob: Fred, you have to listen to me. Your leg! (55) (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?"
Patrick: I think I hurt my leg... (56) (28)  (44)
SpongeBob and Fred: Your what?
Patrick:  MY LEG!! (57) (29) (45)
"Fred:  Aw gee, some guys get all the lucky breaks."
SpongeBob:  At least you know that your leg's! (58) (46) Perimeter is secured.
Fred: I know. I just miss being at the hospital.
SpongeBob: Why?
"Fred: Well, secretly..."
SpongeBob: Ooh!
Fred:  I'm in love with a nurse.
"SpongeBob: Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt your leg! (59) (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?"
Fred: Let's do it! And we should step on it. It's almost time for her break.
SpongeBob: I'd say it's almost time for your break.
SpongeBob: I should probably use something stronger.
"Fred: Yeah, probably."
Convict: Hmm?
SpongeBob: Ahh?
Convict: Hmm? Mm-mm.
SpongeBob:  Hmm.
"SpongeBob: Trust me, Fred, your leg! (61) (49) Is as good as broken."
"Fred: Oh, my sweet nurse angel. I'll be there soon, my love!"
"SpongeBob: And here comes the love train, right on schedule!"
Tom (robot): Don't hurt your leg! (62) (50) Don't hurt your leg! (63) (51)
"SpongeBob: Mr. Robot, that is very rude. How are we supposed to break Fred's leg! (64) (52) Now?"
Fred: He's just afraid if I hurt my LEG! (65) (31) (53) The doctor will replace it with his leg! (66) (54)
"SpongeBob: Oh, is that all? Shucks, he can have my leg!  (67) (32) (55) It'll grow back.  Boink!  Enjoy."
"Tom (robot):  Thank you, sponge man. This one is even better than my leg! (68) (33) (56)"
"Fred: Aw, it's no use, SpongeBob. Maybe the nurse and me were never meant to be."
"SpongeBob: Now, don't put your tail between your legs! (69) (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do...  Heyyy! My leg! (70) (34) (58)"
"Fred: MY HEAD AND TORSO! (71) Wow, that's crazy. They hit me everywhere except MY LEGS! (72) (35) (59)"
"Fred:  Thank you, SpongeBob. If it wasn't for you, I never would have made it back to my angel goddess."
"SpongeBob: Oh, don't thank me, Fred. Your leg! (73) (60) Did all the heavy lifting. I can't wait to meet this angel goddess of yours."
"Fred: Well, wait no longer, SpongeBob. Hello, Nurse Bazooka!"
SpongeBob: Nurse Bazooka?
Nurse Bazooka: Sponge bath time!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Convict, and Tom (robot): No!"
"Patrick: I don't want to! Oh, no, no!"
"Nurse Bazooka: ♪Scrub, scrub, scrubbity, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub♪"
Convict: No!
"Fred: You know, this reminds me of a song."
"Fred: ♪When I met you, my fingers went numb and my arms were all aloof. But I tripped over your heart. And now, my loneliness went poof. Becaaaaaause... my leg (74) (36) (61) is in love!

Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
"SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?"
"Mr. Krabs: Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine."
SpongeBob: Time off?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this... SpongeBob, take a vacation."
"SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, that went better than expected."
"SpongeBob:  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary."
Gary: Meow?
"SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward."
Squidward: I thought you were on vacation.
"Mr. Krabs:  He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy."
SpongeBob: What's a vacation?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work."
SpongeBob:  No work?! But what'll I do all day?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here."
SpongeBob: But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Squidward: Nor will I.
Mr. Krabs: That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
"Patrick:  Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day."
"Mr. Krabs: Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here."
SpongeBob: Replacement?
"Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs: That's enough banter on my dime.
"Patrick: Ok, boss."
"Mr. Krabs: Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job."
"Patrick: Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation."
SpongeBob: I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!"
"Squidward: Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you."
"SpongeBob: I'm not here to see you, Squidward."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?"
SpongeBob: I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
"Mr. Krabs: Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker."
"SpongeBob: You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!"
Patrick: Huh?
"SpongeBob: You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
"SpongeBob: Wait, it's not what you think."
"Mr. Krabs:  Out you go, boy."
SpongeBob: But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
"SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over."
"SpongeBob: Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset."
"Squidward:  SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please."
"SpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up."
"Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up."
"Squidward:  I need 20 Krabby Patties, please."
"SpongeBob: Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming..."
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house."
"Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again."
"Mr. Krabs: I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here."
"Delivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here?"
"Patrick: Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh."
Patrick: It talks!
"SpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh."
"Mr. Krabs: Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son."
"SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy."
"SpongeBob: Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off."
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh.
"SpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K."
"Mr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out."
SpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?
"Mr. Krabs: Look, boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!"
"SpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!"
"Patrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?"
SpongeBob:  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
Patrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?
"SpongeBob:  I've been waiting for you, Patrick!"
"Patrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!"
Squidward: What’ll be?
"Customer: One Krabby Patty, please."
Squidward: One shell on a shingle.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television."
"Mr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!"
"Mr. Krabs: You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore."
SpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.
"Mr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is."
SpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob:  Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
Patrick: Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!
Patrick: Back! Back!
Patrick: Whoa!
"Patrick: Oh, boy! Here it is! My lost coupon! I found it!"
"Patrick: You have fought well today, sea spider, and now I must leave. For I am going to use this coupon to get an ice cream for my bestest friend in the whole ocean—um..  Sponge Knob Hair Pants!  Hmm.  Hmm!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick."
Patrick:  Oh.
SpongeBob: What you doin'?
Patrick: I got this here free coupon and I'm gonna get you an ice cream.
"SpongeBob: That's nice of you, buddy, but I already got an ice cream."
Patrick: Uh...but I'm getting you an ice cream!
SpongeBob: Why would ya? I already got one.
Patrick:  Because I'm a nice guy!
SpongeBob: Wow. There goes the nicest guy.
Patrick: Whoa.
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! I win a free coupon!
Patrick: H-how did you know about my free coupon?
Mr. Krabs: Me back knows.  It breaks out in hives around anything free.
Patrick:  Guh.
Mr. Krabs: I also know how heavy a free coupon can be.
Patrick: It's heavy?
Mr. Krabs: Much too much responsibility for a carefree fellow like you. Tell you what. I'll take that free coupon off your hands for the price of a hearty handshake.
Patrick: Uh...Oh. Ohh! Oh! SpongeBob does love handshakes.
Squidward: You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton.
"Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on. Can't an old crab have a little unscrupulous fun anymore?"
"Patrick: Hey, you ruined my deal! I almost had a handshake!"
"Squidward:  Oh, you dingdong wing nut! Krabs was just trying to steal your coupon!"
Patrick: Steal my coupon? Hmm.  You want my ice cream coupon! You can't have it!
Dave: Okay. Whatever.
Orchid: He never really knew how to sing.
Orchid's friend: No! Singers?
Patrick: You.
Both: Hmm?
"Patrick: Oh, I see you...peeking at my coupon! It's for SpongeBob's ice cream!"
Orchid:  Hooray for SpongeBob.
"Bikini Bottomites: Hey, what's going on here?"
Patrick: Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!
Bikini Bottomites: Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon!
Patrick: No! You can't have my coupon! No! No!
Radio Dispatcher: Officer Slugfish? We got a call about a sea star disturbance on your beat. Please investigate.
"Officer Slugfish: Roger, headquarters. Hey, you."
Officer Slugfish: Headquarters? I couldn't catch him. He got away.
Little Girl: You're a bad baby!
Patrick: Whaa!
"Thaddeus: Oh, look, honey, it's Bikini Bottom's Sidewalk of the Stars."
"Nancy Suzy Fish: This one's gruesome. Hmm, looks like some kids' cartoon. Should we take a photo?"
"Thaddeus: Nah, waste of film."
Patrick: Ooh.  Ah! Come back!  Ah!  I made it.  It's beautiful.
"Lou: And a good ice cream day to you, sir."
"Patrick: Yes, it's a good day for ice cream!"
Lou: And what's your pleasure?
"Patrick: Oh, I want your bestest ice cream for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!"
"Lou: Excellent choice, sir. One Heavenly Paradise coming up."
Patrick: SpongeBob won't mind if I just take a little taste.
"Ice Cream Store Employee: Aw, this coupon's out of date. Expired two years ago. Sorry, we can't honor it."
Patrick: No ice cream for SpongeBob? Huh?
Patrick: I demand that you honor my coupon!
Lou:  Temper tantrum in center aisle!
Ice Cream Store Janitor: I'm on it.
"Patrick: Take my coupon! Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Ah, take my—"
"Ice Cream Store Janitor: You poor, miserable creature."
Patrick: I'm miserable.
"Ice Cream Store Janitor: You wretched, worthless, shabby—"
"Jimmy Gus: Hey, don't you think you're being a little harsh?"
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Not really. Look at him.
Jimmy Gus:  Uh! Never mind. Continue and bump it up a little bit.
"Ice Cream Store Janitor: Listen, buddy, there is one person who can honor this coupon; the person who owns this store. The Ice Cream King himself."
Patrick: The Ice Cream King?
"Ice Cream Store Janitor: Oh, yeah. He lives up there in that mansion."
Patrick: Wow.
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Do you need a push?
"Patrick: Yeah. Would you, please?"
Patrick: Hello?
Ice Cream King: Are you the exterminator?
"Patrick: Oh.  No. I'm not the extra gator. I'm here to redeem my coupon for a free ice cream! It's for my bestest friend, but it's out of date."
Ice Cream King:  They're all out of date because I don't know what year it is.
Patrick: I don't know what anything is.
Ice Cream King: Are you smart or dumb?
Patrick:  Apples?
Ice Cream King: Genius! Let's see your head.  I can't feel your brain.
Patrick:  It's down here today.
Ice Cream King:  Mine too! High five!
Ice Cream King: Secret handshake?
"Ice Cream King: Perfect! You don't know the secret handshake either. Hey, I don't know your name."
"Patrick: Hey, you're right!"
Ice Cream King:  This may still be redeemable according to the fine print.
Patrick: I didn't bring my reading eyes.
Ice Cream King: Try my glasses!
"Patrick: Oh, ooh. It says garbaldy goop."
Ice Cream King: But spelled backwards is...  Poog Ydlabrag. The King's Challenge!
Ice Cream King: Hair growing contest!  Ah-ha!
Patrick: Wow. Oh...
Ice Cream King: That's sad. Watch this.  Try beating that.
"Patrick: Oh, man."
"Ice Cream King: Ha, ha! I beat you."
Patrick: Not so fast!  Ha! Can I redeem my coupon now?
Ice Cream King: Not just yet. Best two out of three.
Both: Ooh.
"Ice Cream King:  Your butterscotch style is strong, Low Fat, but it is no match for my brownie bits!"
"Patrick: Ha, ha, ha! You'll wish your cone was a cup when I whip you into cream! Hi-ya!"
"Patrick: They told me you had scoops, but your serve is soft. I see you've studied the ancient art of failure!  Redeem my coupon!"
Ice Cream King:  Think fast—  rainbow sprinkles!
Ice Cream King: You have played with skill and courage. I will honor your coupon.
Ice Cream King: One free ice cream cone!
"SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?"
"Patrick: I was gonna give you this ice cream,  but it melted. Instead, I got you this hearty handshake."
"SpongeBob: Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!"
SpongeBob:  Care to join me?
Both: Whoo-hoo!
"Mr. Krabs: Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there."
"SpongeBob: Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?"
Mr. Krabs: Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.
SpongeBob:  You have a secret?
"Mr. Krabs: Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles."
"SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. And who will be in charge while you're gone."
"Mr. Krabs: Eh,  well, not Squidward.  No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge."
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.
SpongeBob: I'm... in charge?
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?"
"SpongeBob:  Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir."
Mr. Krabs: What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes
"SpongeBob: Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?"
Squidward: Krabs is gone?
SpongeBob: Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.
Squidward: Wow.
"SpongeBob:  Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge.  Charge. Charge."
Squidward: Wake me up when I care.
SpongeBob: Do you care now?
Squidward: No.
"SpongeBob:  Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?"
Squidward:  What?
"SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm in charge and..."
Squidward:  And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?
SpongeBob: Regulary scheduled nap?
Squidward: This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.
SpongeBob: Really?
"Squidward: But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons."
"SpongeBob:  Well, I, um..."
Squidward: What is it?
"SpongeBob: Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab."
"SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward!"
"Squidward: You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on."
"SpongeBob: Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties."
Squidward: So do it when you're done.
SpongeBob: And unclog the sink.
Squidward: Would you like to hear a secret?
SpongeBob:  What kind of secret?
Squidward: See that guy over there?
SpongeBob: Yes?
"Squidward: He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!"
SpongeBob: Me?
"Squidward: Why don't you give him a couple of pointers. Let him cook his own patty, and don't take no for an answer. He's shy.  This should be good."
"SpongeBob: Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire."
Frank: Uhh... Hello.
SpongeBob: I know your secret...
Frank: What? Who told you?
"SpongeBob: Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!"
"Frank: Yeah, whatever you say, man!"
Squidward: Moron.
"SpongeBob: Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?"
Frank: No.
"SpongeBob: First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula!  So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!"
"Squidward: Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!"
SpongeBob: Order #12!
"Squidward: SpongeBob, what're you doing?"
SpongeBob:  Taking out an order!
Squidward: You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?
SpongeBob: They are?
Squidward: But your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
"SpongeBob: Oh! . It's all coming clear to me now.  There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink.  Enjoy."
"Debbie: Hey, is my food here yet?"
Frankie Billy:  Here. You can have mine.
Delivery Man:  Here are the supplies you've order!
Squidward: What?
"Delivery Man: Please sign here.  Hey, my pen."
"Squidward: Oh, sorry."
"SpongeBob: Ooh!  It's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!"
Squidward: What is this stuff?
"SpongeBob: Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!"
"Squidward:  Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?"
SpongeBob: There's another secret? What's the secret?
Squidward: Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?
SpongeBob: How?
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!"
SpongeBob: Sounds like the Chum Bucket.
"Squidward: Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose."
"SpongeBob: Ohhhhh...  How's this, Squidward?"
Squidward: Lookin' good!
"SpongeBob: You mean, lookin' bad! Enjoy our fine decor!"
Nat: Next time i'm picking the restaurant.
"SpongeBob: One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!"
"Squidward: Mmm, you missed a spot."
SpongeBob: Got it!  Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?
Squidward: Lower!
SpongeBob: Initiating stage two: collateral damage!  How was that?
Squidward: Perfect!
SpongeBob: Ehh...
Harold: This place is disgusting!
"Fred: Yeah, let's get out of here, as soon as I finish this delicious Krabby Patty!"
"SpongeBob: Squidward, all the customers are leaving!"
Squidward: What did we talk about?
SpongeBob: Don't touch the material.
"Squidward: If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!"
"Harold: Come on, let's go."
SpongeBob: WAIT!!! You don't want to miss... This!
Debbie: What's he doing?
"Harold: He's... dancing!  Ok, people, just back away slowly..."
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man!  Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager.  What the...??!! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?"
"SpongeBob: And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho..."
Mr. Krabs: Me customers cowering in fear?
Evelyn: Help... us...
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?
Frank: Order #20 ready for pickup.
"Mr. Krabs:  And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties??!!  Squidward sleeping on the job??!! Ok, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob: I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!"
"Mr. Krabs: All my secrets...?  So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob?  Ah, Gwenevere!!!"
"Mr. Krabs: What is it, boy?"
"Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob?  There, there, kid. What's the big deal?"
"SpongeBob: M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs!  We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days!"
"Mr. Krabs: I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?"
"SpongeBob: You never forget, boss man."
"Mr. Krabs: What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?"
Template:L2
SpongeBob:  Turmeric.
"Mr. Krabs: What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt."
"SpongeBob: That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?"
Mr. Krabs: It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?
"SpongeBob: Scabs, sir?"
"Yeah, SCABS. You know,  salt comes after barnacle shavings.  Or was it LESIONS? Or wait...  No, that doesn't sound right either."
SpongeBob: Was it pustule?
"Mr. Krabs: Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all."
Plankton: No need to wonder about this. I got your formula.  Yee-haw!
"Mr. Krabs: Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?"
"Plankton: Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this."
Plankton: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula.
"SpongeBob: Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out of the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer."
"SpongeBob:  I'm warning you, Mr. Krabs, Patrick'll eat anything you give him!"
"Elaine: Breaking news!  Earlier today, Mr. Eugene Krabs, proprietor of the Krusty Krab restaurant, parted  with his beloved secret formula. We now go to Perch Perkins live on the scene."
"Perch Perkins: Thanks, Elaine. Just moments ago, Eugene Krabs sent his famously delicious secret Krabby Patty formula packing."
"Mr. Krabs: Take care of yourself, little formula."
"SpongeBob:  Good-bye, secret recipe!"
Perch Perkins:  We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs  what compelled him to take such drastic measures.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society."
"So, I finally got him in full retreat."
"Mr. Krabs: All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties."
SpongeBob: I believe we were at turmeric.
"Mr. Krabs: Boy, I thought I told you--"
"SpongeBob: Oh, no we forgot to look at the..."
"Mr. Krabs: Formula, yeah."
SpongeBob: And that formula is...
"Mr. Krabs: On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula."
Mr. Krabs: Think you're up for the challenge?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, all right then,  the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville."
"SpongeBob: Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: This, No. This is the key to me heart?  This is the safe-deposit box key."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, thank you Mr.--"
"Mr. Krabs:  Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab."
SpongeBob: I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. (takes the key) It shan't leaveth my sight.
"Mr. Krabs: (Plankton hears the conversation with some technology of his) Good, let's get you over at the train station."
"Plankton: This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't wait up for me, baby. (cuts to train station)"
SpongeBob: The Oceanic Express. (train whistles) Wish me luck.
"Mr Krabs: Remember what I told you, boy? Keep your eye on the key."
"Oran J. Roughy: I can take your luggage for you, sir. (grabs Patrick) Please follow me."
"SpongeBob: Wow, a real-life butler."
Oran J. Roughy: I am not a butler.
Train Conductor: All aboard!
"SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! (train starts to leave as a bus drives up)"
"Plankton: (gets out of bus and runs up to the train) Wait! Wait for me! (sighs) Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta-- (train steam sends Plankton onto the road when a bus immediately smashes him) Oh, now they're on time... Uh-uh... (cut to inside of train)"
Oran J. Roughy: Your sleeping quarters. (tosses Patrick in there) I trust everything is to your liking.
"SpongeBob: Couldn't be better, butler."
Oran J. Roughy: Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.
"SpongeBob: Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me."
"Oran J. Roughy: An honest mistake, monsieur."
"SpongeBob: Thank you, my good man. (hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper) I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy."
Patrick: Peek-a-boo!
"SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters."
"Patrick: (Patrick's reflection in the mirror gets an angry face while the real Patrick asks SpongeBob a question) SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you? (looks back at the reflection) I think he might be spying on us. (Patrick's reflection goes away) Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry. (Rubs his tummy)"
"SpongeBob: Well, then follow me to the dining car."
Plankton: (climbs on top of a bus) Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way! (Plankton jumps) Uh-oh. (An 18-wheeler blocks his way and he splatters on the windshield. The driver is disgusted by the large green smear and turns on the wipers to scrape squashed Plankton off. He floats on down to the train) I knew I'd make it... (cut to the dining car)
SpongeBob: Ooh Fancy.
"Patrick&#160;: Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks. (baby heard crying)"
"SpongeBob: Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella."
Nanny: I just can't get him to stop crying. The poor dear.
"SpongeBob: (sits down) Hi again, kind butler."
Employee: (sighs) So sorry monsieur. The dining car is closed now.
SpongeBob: (looks at watch) But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
"Employee: No, the dining car is over for you. You must leave now. (pushes SpongeBob away. He trips over a purse. A lady picks him up)"
"SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, ma'am."
"Miss McGuffin: That's quite alright, handsome. (cut to a train terrace)"
"SpongeBob: Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. (SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there)"
Patrick: What is that?
"SpongeBob: That my dear Patrick is—the key! (sees it missing) Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. (Plankton is walking by angrily)"
SpongeBob: Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
"Plankton: Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet."
"SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you."
Plankton: You calling me a liar?
"SpongeBob: Yes. Search him, Patrick."
"Patrick: (puts on latex gloves) With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty."
"Plankton: Oh, drat."
"Patrick: (picks up bowl) Just after I scrub this bowl. (scrubs bowl) Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you. (takes out some clamps. Plankton gasps) After my tasty snack. (uses the clamp to crush the nut. Plankton runs and screams) He's clean. (drops Plankton)"
Plankton: (grunts) I told you I wasn't lying.
"SpongeBob: Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops."
"Patrick: (puts his head out the window) Cops, I need you! (cut to the Krusty Krab)"
Crowd: (chanting) We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
"Customer: Just give me a patty, man."
"Squidward: For the last time, we're out of patties. (customers shout) No need to get excited now."
"Customer: We want our patties, man. (destroys the cash register)"
"Squidward: That's Krusty Krab property. (another customer rips off a pole) That's a load-bearing column. (customer swings the pole at Squidward. He ducks) Hurry, SpongeBob. (cut to train being stopped and all riders are outside the train)"
"SpongeBob: As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act. (SpongeBob points at the baby) Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff."
Plankton: Oh brother.
SpongeBob: Mr. Police Commissioner?
"Commissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants?"
SpongeBob: I sub-- (turns around and walks into the policeman) I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
Nanny: (nervous chuckling) I haven't stolen a thing.
"SpongeBob: Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key."
"Commissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants. (uses tongs to dig into the diaper. A metal sound clinks) Aha!"
SpongeBob: The key!
"Commissioner: (uses tongs to take out a huge diamond) At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang."
SpongeBob: Triplets?
Baby Triplet: (deep voice) I told you taking the train was a mistake.
"Triplet #2: (reveals himself being the legs of the nanny) Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card."
"Baby Triplet: Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?"
"Commissioner: Tell it to your cellmate, junior. (handcuffs the baby)"
SpongeBob: If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
Oran J. Roughy: (sighs) I certainly did not.
SpongeBob: We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
"Oran J. Roughy: For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent."
"Patrick: You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? (there is a full moon. A fish walks up and grows hair and changes into a werewolf. He howls and runs off)"
"Plankton: Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! (gets hit with a piece of popcorn from Patrick)"
Patrick: Sorry. (chomps on his popcorn)
"Plankton: Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin."
Oran J. Roughy: I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.
"Plankton: Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key."
"SpongeBob: Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself."
"Plankton: Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key."
"SpongeBob: I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. (a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets)"
"Keystone Cop: Nothing suspicious here. (the butler's mask falls off) Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches. (Patrick screams)"
"SpongeBob: After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. (sobs) I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab."
"Patrick: (picking his teeth with the key) Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up."
SpongeBob: The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
Patrick: I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little accident earlier.
"SpongeBob: Well, that is great news."
"Patrick: (yawns) Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate."
"SpongeBob: Uh, yeah, me, too. (runs up into the train)"
"Plankton: (hiding behind the door hinges) Me, three. (laughs. Cut to the train moving. SpongeBob and Patrick are grunting as they try to get cozy in their very tight space of cabin)"
"Patrick: Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows."
"SpongeBob: I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite."
"Plankton: Here, maybe I can help. (opens window. SpongeBob and Patrick stick out their tongues like dogs)"
SpongeBob: (sighs) Fresh water.
Patrick: What a cool view.
"Plankton: Yeah, have a better look. (hits them both with a 2x4, sending them out of the train and down a sandy hill. Train whistles) And thanks for the key!"
"Patrick: Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob? (SpongeBob runs off) Guess not. (runs after him)"
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?"
"Patrick: Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?"
"SpongeBob: That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? (they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off)"
"Patrick: Great, now what?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, hop up on my back."
"Patrick: Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride."
SpongeBob: Just do it.
"Patrick: Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr-- (screams. SpongeBob jumped off the cliff) Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please! (crying. SpongeBob flips onto Patrick's back and turns himself into a hang-glider) Hey, we're flying!"
"SpongeBob: There you go, buddy. (sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton) Oh, Plankton!"
Patrick: You can't hide forever. (both yelp as a bunch of luggage falls on them)
Plankton: Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. (Plankton runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick chase after him through many train doors of the caboose and the passenger coaches and head through the coal tender and enter the engine's cabin)
"SpongeBob: Alright, Plankton, end of the line! (sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there) Plankton!"
"Plankton: Over here, choo-choo heads. (laughs as he closes the door and then separates the train by uncoupling the tender, passenger coaches, and caboose from the engine)"
Patrick: That was odd.
"SpongeBob: Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. (sees the engine leaving the train behind) Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look."
"Patrick: Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?"
"SpongeBob: That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there."
"Patrick: Hmm. In that case... (both he and SpongeBob scream. Back to the other train parts with the tender, passenger coaches, and caboose)"
"Fish #1: Hey, what's going on?"
Fish #2: I've got places to be.
Fish #3: Let's go already!
Plankton: (opens one of the train doors and we see Far-Out-Ville and the bank across the way) It's too easy. (back to the head of the train)
"SpongeBob: Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open."
"Patrick: What do I do? What do I do? (reads the brake signal) B-R-A-K-E. BREAK. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. (shows the brake signal in his hand that he just broke)"
SpongeBob: (peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off) You broke the brake?
Patrick: It told me to.
"SpongeBob: What do we do now? (starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls) Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!"
"Patrick: I'm on it. (starts shoveling coal into the engine's firebox) Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. (The train engine overheats and runs out of control as if it might fall apart. At a train signal station, SpongeBob and Patrick signal for help over the radio)"
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We're on an out-of-control train! (man spits out his coffee)
Man: This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?
"SpongeBob: Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train."
"Man: Kid, let me talk to the engineer."
"SpongeBob: Um, who?"
Man: The guy driving the train.
"SpongeBob: Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick."
Patrick: Hi.
"SpongeBob: Oh, the back of the train is gone!"
"Man: Oh, no. (looks at map) The train's headed straight for the rest home. (picture of Rest Home) And that means..."
"SpongeBob: Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?"
"Man: (snaps on helmet) It means that train's coming right through that-- (the train engine crashes through the train depot) Beware the twisted trestles, kid! (lets go of the train engine)"
SpongeBob: What is that?
Man: (points) That's that. (the train engine does some loop-de-loops. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and laugh)
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: (sigh) That was fun.
"Patrick: Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us! (runs faster than the engine and holds up a 'STOP' sign. The train keeps going. Patrick tries again but uses a lemonade stand) Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon... (groans. The train engine passes by) Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! (runs past the train again)"
"SpongeBob: 'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... (Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks)"
"Patrick: Hey. Hey, wait for me... (climbs into the engine's cabin) Hey, SpongeBob! (the train engine crashes through a tunnel)"
SpongeBob: Whoa! Whoa! (the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home)
Rest Home Citizen: There's a train behind you.
Rest Home Citizen #2: How many times do you think I'm falling for that one?
"Patrick: Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. (the train engine stops before hitting the Rest Home. One of the citizens peeks at the other ones cards)"
Rest Home Citizen #2: Hey! (SpongeBob and Patrick sigh)
"SpongeBob: Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. (the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville)"
"Patrick: Hmm. (reads the throttle letters) T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Break! I can do that. (breaks the throttle handle. Walks up to SpongeBob) You didn't need this, did you? (The engine starts to increase its speed and go faster and faster. Cut to the bank)"
"Plankton: Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha. (uses ladder to get up to the safe-deposit box) Come to papa! (opens box and gets formula) At last, my day of triumph has come! Again."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, well. (turns on a light)"
Plankton: What? B-b-but how?
"Mr. Krabs: You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?"
"Plankton: I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah."
"Mr. Krabs: (laughs) Sure. I believe ya. (grabs Plankton) Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton. (as he puts Plankton in his safe-deposit box, Plankton jumps out and gets the formula) Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?"
"Plankton: Checkmate, Krabs! (laughs evilly. The runaway engine runs into the bank and squishes Plankton) Ow."
"Mr. Krabs: Good job, boyo."
"SpongeBob: I simply refused to fail, sir."
"Bank Teller: (clears throat) That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?"
"Mr. Krabs: Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'! Take care of it, will ya boy?"
"Bank Teller: (grabs Mr. Krabs) Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost."
Mr. Krabs: Noooooooooooooooo!
Narrator: 75 years later...
SpongeBob: (now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom) And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?
"SpongeBob's Grandson: (playing a game) Shh! I just beat my high score! Oh, yeah!"
SpongeBob: Kids today. (snores)
"SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah!  Oh, oh!  Oh!  Ooh!  Oh!"
"Squidward: SpongeBob, I need—  Whoa. Sponge—"
"SpongeBob: Patty, no!  Oh, I can't quite reach it."
"Mr. Krabs:  Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out."
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights.  Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept.  There you are!  Good as new!  Hold on, patty! I've got you!  No!"
"Mr. Krabs: Okay, SpongeBob. Time to come back down and get to work so I can garnish your wages for wasting that patty!"
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob: Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all."
"Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, boy-o. Just climb on down!"
"SpongeBob:  No, I'm good!"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I order you to come down here immediately!"
"Sandy: Don't worry, I'll get him down with my newest invention: Extend-O-Boots. I just press this button, and...  Whoa!  Sorry, I haven't worked out all the kinks yet!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa-oh-oh!  Whoa!"
Squidward: What the—
"Mr. Krabs: So, uh... anybody else got an idea?"
"Patrick: It's okay, I got him!  Hey, SpongeBob. Whatcha doing wa-a-ay up here?  Let's climb down now."
"SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead.  I just can't do it. It's too far down!"
"Patrick: Aw, don't worry, SpongeBob. Your old pal Patrick has another plan to get you off this roof."
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Sure. Just do what I do.  Hm...  Ow!
"SpongeBob: Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am."
"SpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here."
"SpongeBob: Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there.  Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone!  Ah!  Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you."
"Squidward: Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good.  Huh?!"
"SpongeBob: Hmm, maybe he's hungry.  Come on, Squidward! Eat your...  Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp!  Ow-ow-ow-ow!  Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep.  Oh, I wish I had my bed...  Hey, that gives me an idea."
"SpongeBob:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah."
SpongeBob: Perfect. Good night...  nobody.
"Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo, SpongeBob! Time to wake up!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs:  I've come up with a solution for your little roof problem, boy-o!"
Mr. Krabs: Now you can cook even if you can't get back down.
"SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: Now start making me money!
"SpongeBob: Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again!  Something still doesn't feel right, though."
"SpongeBob: Perfect! Just like my old kitchen.  I'm ready!  Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers?  Eureka!"
"Customers: We paid for patties, Krabs! Where's our food?"
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, calm down, everyone. I'm sure we can figure something out that doesn't involve violence or...refunds."
"Gus:  Hey, outside! It's raining Krabby Patties!"
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Umpire: Safe!
"Jennifer Millie: I'll take one Krabby Patty and a drink, please.  I said, And a drink!"
Frankie Billy:  Huh?  These are cold! I paid for a hot meal.
Customers: Yeah!
"Frankie Billy: Maybe if we go up there, we can get 'em fresh!"
Norma Rechid: To the roof!
Customers: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Whoa! I better make more room up here.
"Mr. Krabs: You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser.  But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming!"
SpongeBob: Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.
"Squidward: Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now."
"Mr. Krabs: Ten more patties, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. K."
SpongeBob: Aw...
"Mr. Krabs:  No, no—me money!"
"Customer:  Hey, I just realized being outside is awful!"
Fred: Rain? But we're under—
"Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait, don't go!  A little wind never hurt anyone!"
"Patrick: Whoa, whoa!  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!"
"SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful, boy-o!"
"Henry-Bart: Yeah, it's pretty nice, but now that we're not outside, I'm starting to get bored."
"Customers: Yeah, so..."
SpongeBob:  Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing!  Whoo!
Customers: He's right!
SpongeBob: Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!
"Mr. Krabs: You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!"
SpongeBob: And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!
Squidward: Time to go home already?  Ow.
"Karen: Another bag of chum...  Bleh, now to shape this into his Highness' dinner request."
Plankton:  Almost done.
Karen:  Here you go. Eat up.
Plankton: What's this supposed to be?
"Karen: Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea. Also known as dinner."
"Plankton: Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry."
"Karen: Well, I told you months ago that my memory is full but you've been too busy with your latest project. So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?"
"Plankton: Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you, foolproof!  Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well."
"Plankton: Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife!"
Plankton: Karen 2!
Karen:  Karen 2?! I've been...replaced?!
"Plankton: I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package!"
Karen: I can't believe this! And after all I've done for you! You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?!
"Plankton: Well, I had to cut cost somewhere."
Karen 2.0: Who are you calling cheap?! At least I don't rust!
"Karen: You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment!"
"Plankton: Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine."
Karen: Oh that does it!
"Plankton: Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler."
Plankton: And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
"Karen: Here's your stir fry, little man!"
"Plankton: Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret!"
Karen: You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system!
"Plankton: Huh, what happened?"
"Karen 2.0: I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source."
"Plankton: Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard! Goodbye, Karen Classic,  hello, Karen 2!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, the end of another lucrative work day, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear."
"Mr. Krabs: Seriously, son, you gotta lighten up. Well, good night, kiddo."
"SpongeBob: Good night, sir.  See ya tomorrow."
"Mr. Krabs: Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet."
"SpongeBob: Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye  Toodaloo! Whoa!"
"Mr. Krabs: Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash."
SpongeBob: This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system.
Mr. Krabs:  Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
"SpongeBob: Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton."
Mr. Krabs: Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
SpongeBob: Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
"Mr. Krabs: Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer?  Let's plug her in, see what she can do."
Mr. Krabs: She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works.  This thing does text mails right?
"SpongeBob: Yeah, I think so."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, that sounds promising."
"Mr. Krabs: Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady."
Karen: Don't tell me not to cry!
Mr. Krabs: She's malfunctioning!
SpongeBob: Must be the dial-up thingy!
"Mr. Krabs: You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry!"
"Karen: Oh it's not the dial-up thingy. It's Plankton, he dumped me for a newer piece of hardware."
"Mr. Krabs: Help me out here, buddy."
"SpongeBob: Hey, there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean, you guys were made for each other. Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?"
Karen:  You men are all alike!
"Mr. Krabs: Wait! Where ya goin’? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth.  Let's talk this out."
"SpongeBob: Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what part of free computer are you not understanding?"
"Plankton: Tonight, we celebrate, and tomorrow, the secret formula."
"Karen: I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live. Goodbye, you miserable little bug!"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, in the case, welcome aboard!"
SpongeBob: All right!
Mr. Krabs: Yeehaw!
Squidward: Huh?
Karen: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Squidward: My order?
"Mr. Krabs: I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on, Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her."
"Squidward: So, I'm fired? No more taking orders?  No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob?! I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free!  Whoo."
"Mr. Krabs: Not so fast, Mr. Squidward."
"Ivy (gray): Hi there, can I get a Krabby Patty and a side of coral bits please?"
"Karen: You'll get your Krabby Patty when I'm good and ready!  Sorry, I'm just...  ...going through a lot emotionally, right now."
"SpongeBob: Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?"
Karen: You defragment your hard drive?
"SpongeBob: No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab."
"Plankton: Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself, you know."
"Karen 2.0: I'm trying to open the door. You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know."
"Plankton: Yes, I suppose that's true. All right, I got this.  What's she doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?!"
"Karen: Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker."
Karen 2.0: And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been.
Karen: Analog? Who you calling analog?!
Karen 2.0: I see you've taken your proper role as a Cash Machine.
Karen: At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!
"Karen 2.0: Well, at least I can say I was designed."
Karen:  Why I oughta...!
Karen 2.0: You rusty bucket of bolts.
Karen: You glorified toaster oven!
Karen 2.0: You poor excuse for a house wife.
"Nazz-Mini: Hey, what's going on?"
"Dave: I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side."
Mr. Krabs: Seriously? Did you just say money?
"Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?"
Karen 2.0: Prepare to have your motherboard rattled.
Mr. Krabs: ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
Karen: You're about to have your cookies crumbled!
Karen 2.0: Bring it.
Plankton: Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
Karen:
Karen 2.0: That will defrag your algorithms.
Plankton: Ow!
Karen 2.0: Plankton?
Karen:  Stop! He's hurt!
Karen 2.0: You're throwing in the towel?
Karen: You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!
"Karen: No one runs down my man. Planky, say something..."
"Plankton: Take me home, baby..."
"Karen: Even though you are a tiny green loser, I could never stay...  ... mad  ...at  ...you."
"Plankton: Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again!"
"Plankton: I hope this works... Oh, Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again!"
Karen:  What happened?
"Plankton: I had a reality check, that's what happened."
"Plankton: Come on. Let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey."
Karen: I had the strangest dream. I dreamt there were two of me!
"Plankton: Two of you? Heh, well that is strange."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?"
"SpongeBob:  Well, we could rebuild Karen 2."
"Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?"
"Mr. Krabs: Keep it up, Mr. Squidward. The kids love robots."
"Squidward: Oh, well. I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now."
SpongeBob:
"Patrick: ♪Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!♪"
"SpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?"
Patrick: ‘Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
"Patrick: My big sister, Sam!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!"
Patrick:  Nobody does.  I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
"SpongeBob: Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick."
Patrick: Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock!
"SpongeBob: It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!"
"Patrick: Thanks, man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!"
Squidward:  Would you two pipe down!
"Patrick: Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister."
"Squidward: Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you."
Sam:
Squidward:
Patrick: ...Sam!
Sam:  Brubber!
Patrick: Sis!
Sam:
Patrick: It's so good to see you.
Sam: You. Sister Sam. Have much catch up to do.
"Patrick: Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back."
Sam:  Yellow square touch brubber! Make sister Sam mad!
Patrick: I cleaned my rock just for you.
SpongeBob:
Patrick: Let’s go inside and play.
Sam: House too small. Make bigger.
"Patrick: Hey, great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-"
Sam: No.
Patrick: Huh?
Sam: I have tools right here.
"Squidward: Oh, dear Neptune. Didn't you hear me-"
Sam:
"Patrick: Thanks, sis!"
Sam: Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.
"Squidward: Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand."
"Sam: If big nose no like sand, big nose move!"
"Squidward: This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor."
Sam:  No laughing!
"SpongeBob: No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?"
"Squidward: Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier."
Sam:
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Squidward, you jokester."
Sam:
Squidward: Do you think she looks a little... miffed?
Sam:  Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!
Patrick: Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
Squidward: Look what we've done?!
Sam:
Squidward:
SpongeBob:
"Tuck: Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss."
"Clem: Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder."
"Patrick: Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?"
Sam: Blecorate?
"Patrick: You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!"
Squidward:
Sam: Make new house spiffy.  Spiffy!
"Squidward: Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!"
Sam:  Blecorate.
"Patrick: That's the spirit, Sis."
"Squidward: Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!"
"Patrick: Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!"
"Squidward: You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!"
Sam:  More spiffy!
Squidward: But that's from...  My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
"Patrick: How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things..."
"SpongeBob: Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?"
"Patrick: No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!"
"SpongeBob: It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-"
Sam: Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water!  Meanies go home!
"Patrick: Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock."
Sam: Meanies is mean. .
Squidward:
"SpongeBob: Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them."
Squidward: The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!
SpongeBob: I don't think you should do that.
"Squidward: Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get!"
Sam: Who makes noise?  Spiffy broken!  Sister mad!
"SpongeBob: Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy."
Sam:  Sister Sam rearrange now!
SpongeBob: Please don't.
Sam:
"SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started."
Squidward:
Patrick and Sam:  Huh?!
"SpongeBob:  Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?"
"Squidward: Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!"
Sam:  That'll teach those meanies.
"Patrick: Your still my rock big, sis."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control."
"Patrick: SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?!"
SpongeBob: She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
"Patrick: Well, I guess she can get a little carried away."
Sam: What Patrick doing? Why Patrick talk to meanies?
"Patrick: Well uh...well...well it's about your temper, Sam."
Sam: No have temper! That make sister Sam SO mad! Sister Sam put on mean face!  Now smash brubber's house!
Patrick: Not the rock!
Sam:  Patrick? Little Brubber? Little Brubber no wake.
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick:  Cookie Dough!
Sam: Patrick Ok! Sister Sam feel bad. Sorry she hurt Patrick. Should protect little brubber. She go now.
"Patrick: Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!"
"Sam: Yes, Sister Sam must go. Late for manicure.   Bye, brubber!"
"Patrick: Bye, sis."
Sam:
Patrick: Isn't my sister something?
"SpongeBob: Aw, she's something, all right!"
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
"TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil."
"Villain:  Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool!"
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
"SpongeBob:  Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot."
"Patrick:  Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!"
"SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good."
"Squidward:  Fun, fun."
SpongeBob: You know what this means...
Patrick: Donuts!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oohhh...
SpongeBob:  By the power of Neptune!
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, UNITE!"
"SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble!  Think... harder... Barnacle Boy...  Here they come!"
"SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful."
Squidward:  What the? Ohh!
"SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak."
"Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!"
"SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave."
"Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man."
"Squidward: SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, open up!"
SpongeBob:  Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
"SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend!"
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
"SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover."
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite!"
"SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?"
"Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you.  There they are. Right over there."
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh!
"Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?"
"Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?"
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
"Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired."
SpongeBob:  But you can't retire. There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha?! Evil! EEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIILLLL!!!  Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
"SpongeBob: All I said was, there's evil afoot."
Mermaid Man: EVIL! EVIL! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
"Mermaid Man:  EVIL! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil!  Death raaaaay!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
"SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience.  The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement!"
Patrick: Oohhh! Pretty lights!
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf!  To the broccoli!  Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
"Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha."
"Mermaid Man: To the table, awaaaay!"
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man."
"Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman."
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
"Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something."
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me boy?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae.  And he globs onto the undersea dome.  And he starts sucking on the glass.
"Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?"
"SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement."
"Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife."
Manager:  What is going on in here?!
Mermaid Man:  You may kiss the bride!
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
"SpongeBob: No, but I'm married."
"Mermaid Man:  Up, up, and awaaaay. Up, up, and awaaaay."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, myah. This purse is so big and heavy."
"Patrick:  Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that!"
SpongeBob: AHHHH! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
Patrick:  It's working!
"SpongeBob:  Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?"
Barnacle Boy:  Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
"SpongeBob:  Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open!"
"Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!"
Mermaid Man:  STOP SHOUTIN'! I'M NAPPIN!
"Barnacle Boy:  It's not me, you ol' coot!"
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here!
"SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man."
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile!
Barnacle Boy: GAH! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! ...Where is it!?
Barnacle Boy: There it is!  You know what this means!?
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
"Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother."
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
"Mermaid Man:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!  Throw a waterball at 'em!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs!
Patrick: Hehehehehe...
"Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man."
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away!
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpoo!.
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
"Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!"
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite!"
"Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster."
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures! ATTACK!!!
"SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Mission accomplished, Patrick!"
"Patrick: Yeah, we did it!"
"Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!"
"Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot."
Mermaid Man:  Who are you?
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits.
"Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone!  What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello?!  The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed."
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you.
Mrs. Puff:  We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!
"Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff: Gal Pals! Yeah!"
"Karen:  Oh, a Krabby Patty!  Perfect."
Mrs. Puff:  Ugh.
Karen: The engine needed greasing.
"Sandy:  Congratulations, Mrs. Puff!  Your boat and trailer just got hitched!"
"Mrs. Puff:  Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?"
"Pearl: This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back."
SpongeBob:  Boo! Who likes eggs?
"Pearl: Not now, SpongeBob.  Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame."
"SpongeBob: Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary."
Pearl:  Keep working on it.
Sandy: Here comes our newest member!
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! Yeah!"
"Sandy: Here, let me get your bag."
SpongeBob: Nice and cozy.
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: ♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout Gal Pals right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪"
"Mrs. Puff: Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?"
"SpongeBob: Where am I?  Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets.  Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do?  Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive!  Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut.  I've got a lucky peanut!"
Mrs. Puff: Here we are.
"Sandy:  Uh-oh, looks like we lost something."
"Pearl:  Oh, no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen!"
"Karen:  Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend."
Pearl:  She must be psychic.
"Sandy: Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it!  All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!"
"Karen: Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger.  Oh, yeah."
"Sandy: Yep, nature always provides."
"Mrs. Puff:  Hey, where's the newbie?"
"Pearl: Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right."
"SpongeBob:  I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes!  Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing.  Hello?  Shell-lo?"
"Pearl: SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive."
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?"
"Pearl: Uh, well, there are a lot of trees."
"SpongeBob: Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees.  Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars.  Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees..."
"Mrs. Puff:  Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious."
"Karen:  Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor."
"Sandy:  Okay, Gal Pals,  it's time to initiate our newest member."
Mrs. Puff: You are now a Gal Pal.
Pearl: That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?
Sandy: Why would we do that?
"Karen: Yeah, we like you."
Mrs. Puff: We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I—
Sandy: Puff! Shh.
Pearl: Who's Slippery Giveth?
"Sandy: Oh, Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night."
Mrs. Puff: We don't even remember what the fight was about.
Sandy: It sure was a humdinger of an argument!
Karen: She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals.
Mrs. Puff: Then she just ran off into these woods!
"Sandy: Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge."
Karen: That's her pendant you're wearing.
"Pearl:  Flibberty Gibbet?!  Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?!  Thanks, gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me."
Karen: Sure you did.
Mrs. Puff: You should have seen your face.
Sandy: We got you good!
"Pearl:  Mm, Gal Pals."
Sandy:  What was that?
"Pearl: 'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank."
Karen: Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.
Mrs. Puff: She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.
Sandy: And she did run off into these woods.
"Pearl: Wait, that was all the parts!"
"Mrs. Puff: Quick, let's hide in the cabin!"
"Pearl: Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right, SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!"
"SpongeBob:  There's another tree.  And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works.  Tree, tree, tree, tree."
"Mrs. Puff: So, SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back.  We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom!  Ooh, what am I saying?"
Sandy: Let's scale it down a smidge.
"Karen: Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up."
"Sandy: You coming, Pearl?"
"Pearl: Well, I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark."
"Sandy: Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!"
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet!"
"Mrs. Puff: It's her! Oh, s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!"
"Sandy: I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!"
Karen: Let's go!
SpongeBob: Rawr! Hmm?
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: No, no! SpongeBob! Don't go in!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, hello."
"Sandy: Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!"
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl:  Gal Pals."
"SpongeBob: Wow!  Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it.  Wow!  I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals."
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl:  Huh?"
Sandy:  It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.
"Flibberty Gibbet:  Did someone say my name?  Hi, gals!"
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet!"
Flibberty Gibbet: I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!
"SpongeBob:  Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!"
"Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals!"
"Narrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration."
Frank: Will you hurry up?
Narrator: A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. If they weren't the ones causing the problem.
"Mermaid Man: Let's see... I want a... no.  I want a...  uh, no, uh, hmmm..."
"Squidward: Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!"
"SpongeBob:  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty."
Mermaid Man: I've made my decision!
Line of Customers: Hooray!
Mermaid Man: One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
"Barnacle Boy: Now, wait just a darn minute!"
Line of Customers: Awww!
Barnacle Boy: I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy: Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!
Mr. Krabs: The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach.
"Barnacle Boy: And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots."
Squidward:  One Pipsqueak patty  and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy: I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
"Barnacle Boy: Feed this, old man!"
All except MM and BB:  Ooooooooh.
"Barnacle Boy: I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!"
"SpongeBob: I respect you, Barnacle Man!"
"Barnacle Man: That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, Man! I... Ohh... forget you people. I say if you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... evil!"
SpongeBob: Evil?
"Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy &amp; Patrick: Evil?"
Mermaid Man: Evil!
Barnacle Man: I'm crossing over... to the dark side!
Mr. Krabs: Why should I waste money lighting the whole store?
Dirty Bubble: Did someone say evil?
SpongeBob: Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble!
"Barnacle Man: Nighty night, you old goat!"
Mermaid Man: Nighty-night!  Will you tuck me in?
"Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report.  Man Ray,  the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy..."
Barnacle Man: Barnacle Man!
Realistic Fish Head: ...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom.
Barnacle Man: Shh!
Senior Citizen:  I'll get you crazy kids!
"Realistic Fish Head: These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking you all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you?"
"Mermaid Man: Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.!  Nothing!  Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles.  Mmm.  Goes right through me every time."
"Barnacle Man:  You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance."
"SpongeBob:  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?"
Mermaid Man: You're right.  I give up.
SpongeBob: You can't give up. What if we help you?
"Mermaid Man: No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?"
SpongeBob: Okay!
Mermaid Man: Who wants to save the world?
SpongeBob: I do!
Sandy: I do!
Patrick: I do!
Squidward: I don't.
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired!"
Mermaid Man: Then it's settled! To the Mermalair!
SpongeBob: Wow! The Mermalair!
Mermaid Man: These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
"SpongeBob: Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too."
"Mermaid Man: Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours!"
Sandy: Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
Mermaid Man: Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
Squidward: I can think of three good reasons.
Narrator:  The Quickster...with the uncanny ability to run really...quick!
SpongeBob: Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  You want to see me do it again?
Narrator:  Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!
Squidward: Krakatoa!
Narrator: The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms!
Patrick: I can finally touch my toes!
Narrator: And Miss Appear...now you see her...  ...now you don't.
Sandy: Does this outfit make me look fat?
Narrator: The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
"Mermaid Man: So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives."
"Chief: Super Acquaintances, we need your help."
SpongeBob: Holy halibut! It's the chief!
"Chief: Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L."
Patrick: The whose-abouts of what?
"Sandy: You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say Salsa Verde."
"Chief: Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at Make-Out Reef. You know, Make-Out Reef?  Whoo hoo hoo!"
"SpongeBob: Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!"
Mermaid Man: Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
"Squidward: Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times."
"Mermaid Man: To Make-Out Reef,  away!"
Patrick: Does this mean we're not getting pizza?
"John &amp; Nancy: Stop, please!"
"E.V.I.L.: John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!"
"Dirty Bubble: Oh!  Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!"
"Man Ray: Haha, with pleasure!"
"Sandals: Hey man, that's not cool."
Mermaid Man: Leave those young lovers alone!
"Man Ray: Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!"
Mermaid Man: You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
Man Ray: You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!
SpongeBob:  Make that two!
Man Ray: The Quickster!
Squidward:  Three!
Barnacle Man: Captain Magma!
Patrick:  Four!
Dirty Bubble: The Elastic Waistband!
Sandy:  Five!
E.V.I.L.: M-M-Miss Appear!
"Mermaid Man: And me makes ten, I think."
Man Ray: Uh-oh.
Dirty Bubble: I don't have a good feeling about this.
"Barnacle Man: Oh, there goes our toy deal."
"Mermaid Man: Super Acquaintances, attack!"
"Barnacle Man: Oh no, please, mercy!"
Squidward: Krakatoa!
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
"Patrick: I'll save you, Quickster!"
"Mermaid Man: I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls!  Aha!"
"Squidward: Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag...  ma..."
"Sandy: Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  Aaaaaah!"
SpongeBob: Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...glad that's over!
"Barnacle Man: We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.!  You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands."
"Mermaid Man: Okay, what do you want?"
Man Ray: World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
Dirty Bubble: And make him eat dirt! Hahaha!  In addition to the...domination thing.
"Barnacle Man: Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three..."
"Man Ray: Come on, world domination!"
Barnacle Man: I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
Dirty Bubble:  Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?
"Barnacle Man: Need a hand, superpal?"
"Mermaid Man: Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty!"
Man Ray: Was that it?  That's sickening!
"Dirty Bubble: Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with a killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!"
"Man Ray:  Oh, Neptune, shut up!"
"Mermaid Man: How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?"
"Barnacle Man: Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing."
"Mrs. Puff: I suggested having this lesson in the cemetery because I thought you couldn't kill anyone here, but now I'm afraid you're disturbing the dead!"
"Mrs. Puff:  Before they bury me, get me to a payphone."
Mrs. Puff: I need to call another instructor for you. I just...can't...take it anymore!
Mrs. Puff:  Huh? You stopped in front of the prison? Never mind! Any place is better than in this boat with you!
Stickyfins Whiting:  What are ya waiting for? Step on it!
SpongeBob: You must be the new driving instructor.
"SpongeBob: Student driver. That's me. I just don't take a bad picture, do I?"
"Stickyfins: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm your new driving instructor."
SpongeBob: Great! Look how I can tune the radio.
Radio announcer: Breaking news!
Both: Huh?
"Radio announcer: Notorious criminal, Stickyfins Whiting, has just escaped from prison."
"Stickyfins: Very good radio tuning skills. Now, drive as fast as you can!"
Mrs. Puff: Stop! SpongeBob! Come back!  I can't believe I said that!
"Dorsal Dan: Stickyfins, where are you? I can't be that late."
Mrs. Puff:  Follow that sponge!
"Dorsal Dan: Hey, you ain't Stickyfins."
"Mrs. Puff: And you ain't a chocolate cake! Now, step on it!"
"Dorsal Dan: Yes, ma'am! Dorsal Dan at your service!"
Stickyfins:  Oh! Oh! Crater-face! We're being followed! Lose that tail!
SpongeBob: I thought it'd made me look cool.  Guess not.
Stickyfins: Not that tail! The cops behind us! Drive crazy!
"SpongeBob: Ohhhhh, that I can do!"
Dorsal Dan: Wow! He's driving like a psycho! Who taught him how to drive?
SpongeBob:  Good baby?
Stickyfins: Waaaaaahhhhh!
Rich Man: Gosh!
"SpongeBob:  I say, how's my automobiling?"
Stickyfins:  Simply smashing.  You're simply smashing into things!
Stickyfins: Let's see what's on the menu!  Oh! I'll take those!
Customers: Hmm?
"SpongeBob: Excuse me sir, I'm in the middle of a driving lesson!"
"Stickyfins: Look out, you maniac!"
Stickyfins: You're going the wrong way! Turn this thing around!
SpongeBob: You got it! Turning around!
"SpongeBob: Oh, you're a great instructor! What now?"
Stickyfins: Just...go with the flow.
"Dorsal Dan: Looks like they shook us. Don't worry, we'll find them."
Mrs. Puff: They'll probably revoke my teacher's license for this.
"Dorsal Dan: Hey, I'm a teacher too! I teach all kinds of things. Safe cracking, burglary, getaway driving."
Mrs. Puff:  I did notice you're a very good driver.
"Dorsal Dan: Ha, ha, you ain't such a bad passenger yourself."
"Mrs. Puff:  Oh, my!"
Stickyfins: Here's your next test. Follow me.
Stickyfins: Distracted drivers are dangerous. I want you to distract that salesman in the store.
SpongeBob: I don't understand how this is gonna help with my driving.
"Stickyfins: It's, uh...abstract thinking."
"SpongeBob: Hey, I've heard of that!"
Salesman: Welcome!
SpongeBob: Distract with the abstract.
"Salesman: Hey, shapes and noises! I love it!"
SpongeBob: What's the next lesson?
Stickyfins: The nearest electronic store.
"SpongeBob: Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy."
Salesman: Help! Help! I've been robbed!
"Mrs. Puff: I've shopped in that place before, and I've been robbed too."
"Dorsal Dan: What now, beautiful?"
Mrs. Puff: I wouldn't mind seeing you navigate a four-way stop.
Dorsal Dan: Romance always has the right of way.
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, my!"
SpongeBob:  Ah! Wha— Oop.  Whoa!
Stickyfins: I need to launder these bills—fast!
"SpongeBob: I know just the place! But first, let me adjust your seat."
Stickyfins: Ooh!  Hey! What's the big idea?
Stickyfins: What is wrong with you?
Dorsal Dan: I think your sponge should be around here somewhere.
Mrs. Puff:  I didn't even feel you slow down. You've got such a gentle foot on the pedal.
Dorsal Dan: Gosh. No one's ever said I had a gentle foot before.
Mrs. Puff: Oh—ho.  Oh! Oh!
Mrs. Puff:  SpongeBob!
Stickyfins: Why's that jerk honking? Go! Drive!
Mrs. Puff: Sorry about your gentle foot! Hi-yah!
Dorsal Dan: Hey—Owww!
"SpongeBob:  Oh! Ooh, driving range!"
SpongeBob: How's my driving?
Stickyfins:  Doh!  Doh—doh—doh—doh—doh—
"SpongeBob:  Doh! That kinda hurts, don't ya think?"
Stickyfins:  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"Stickyfins: For the love of Neptune, let's get outta here!"
"SpongeBob:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh!  Oh, yeah."
"Stickyfins: Ah!  Ha, ha!"
Stickyfins: Oh! Oh! Ow!  Oh!
Stickyfins: Ooh—ow!
Stickyfins:  I just wanna know...what'd I ever do to deserve this?
"SpongeBob: Would you like to test me on road signs now? Let's see...  Stop, No Left Turn, and that one over there that says Falling Rocks!"
"Stickyfins: Wait, what?  Ooh!  Oof!"
Stickyfins:  Whoa!
Mrs. Puff:  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!
Dorsal Dan: Stickyfins!
Stickyfins: Dorsal Dan! Help meeeee!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mrs. Puff! The new instructor's been teaching me so much. Not as much as you. But y'know, different things."
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you gotta keep your eyes on the road!"
SpongeBob: He hasn't taught me that one yet!  Oh!
Stickyfins: Ah! Get me outta here!
"SpongeBob: Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks."
Officer: This is the police. Pull over!
Stickyfins: Right turn! Make a right turn!
"SpongeBob: Aye, aye, professor!"
"Stickyfins: Yes! I'm back!  Thank Neptune! Don't let me out ever again! It's not safe out there! Lock me away! Forever, and ever!"
Security Guards and Warden: Huh?
"Security Guard:  Warden, I found this one pulling up outside the prison."
Warden: Dorsal Dan! The notorious getaway driver. Toss him in the clink!
"Mrs. Puff:  I'll wait for you, my little tenderfoot!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, where'd the new instructor go? Oh, well, I still have ten minutes left on my driving lesson.  Oh, Mrs. Puff?"
Mrs. Puff: I'll confess to anything! Throw away the key! It's not safe out here! Let me in!
"Officers: Drive safely, and always wear your seat belt!"
SpongeBob:  Wait for it...
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 100%.
"Squidward: Another day, another migraine.  Heh, heh, mi..."
Automated Voice: On Time Percentage: 12%.
"Squidward: ...graine. Heh, heh, heh."
"SpongeBob: Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?"
"Squidward: Yeah, great."
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Yeah.
"SpongeBob: Aww, yeah."
Squidward:  Yes!
"SpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter."
"Strangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police?"
SpongeBob: Yes.
"Squidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?"
"SpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts."
"Squidward: Whatever. Huh?  SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?"
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: That's the Tattletale Strangler.
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in!
"SpongeBob: He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?"
"Officer Johnson: You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time."
"SpongeBob: Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?"
"Officer Nancy: Who, Strangler?"
"SpongeBob: Yeah, Strangler."
"Officer Nancy: Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time."
"SpongeBob: Hey, that looks like me!"
"Officer Nancy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you."
Officer Johnson: Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
"Officer Nancy: Oops, not again."
"Officer Johnson: Yep, he got away."
"SpongeBob: You nice officers will protect me, right?"
"Officer Nancy: We ain't bodyguards, kid."
"Officer Johnson: Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale."
SpongeBob: Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!
"Mr. Krabs:  I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'.  When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?"
"SpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs:  The Tattletale Strangler?!  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!"
"SpongeBob:  Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard."
"Strangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out."
"SpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture."
"Strangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough."
"SpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty."
"Strangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here.  Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card."
"SpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?"
"Strangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby."
SpongeBob: Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium.
"Strangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine."
"SpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?"
"Strangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley..."
SpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
"Strangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect."
"SpongeBob: Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands."
"Strangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick."
"SpongeBob: Quick is my middle name.  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?"
Strangler: Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
SpongeBob: I'll take both!
"Dry Cleaner: Here you go, Mr. SquarePants."
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
Dry Cleaner: Is there something wrong?
"SpongeBob: I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?"
Strangler: Can we just go to your house?!
"SpongeBob: Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have."
"Strangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean..."
SpongeBob: Protect me?
Strangler: Thanks.
"SpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?"
Narrator: Twenty minutes later...
"SpongeBob: Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?"
"Strangler: Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window.  I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?"
"SpongeBob: Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible.  Ya."
Strangler: Cleats?!  Get your feet out of my eye sockets!
"SpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!"
Narrator: Six hours later...
"SpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside..."
Strangler:  Close the door...
"SpongeBob: Well, here we are."
Strangler: I've finally got you all alone!
"SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?  Ooh."
"Strangler: Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale!"
All of SpongeBob's friends: Surprise!
"SpongeBob: A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?"
Patrick: It's on the invitations you sent us.  Let's boogie!
"SpongeBob: Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest.  Ahh, alone at last."
"Strangler:  What? Huh? Huh? What? Huh?  So, we're all alone now?"
"SpongeBob: Just you, me, and the floorboards.  Yeah."
"All: Happy birthday, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: How did you guys know today is my birthday?
Patrick: We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more!
SpongeBob: Thanks for coming!  Alone again.
Strangler: Is it true? Everybody's gone?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
"Strangler: No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?"
SpongeBob: Oh yeah.
Strangler: In that case...
"Patrick: Great parties, huh?"
"Strangler: Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go."
SpongeBob: Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
"Strangler: Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler."
"Patrick: I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in!"
"SpongeBob: So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy."
Strangler:  He's not the Strangler!
SpongeBob: He's not?
Strangler:  I am!
"SpongeBob: Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?"
"Strangler: Oh, it's a fake, you idiot! I bought it at the party store!"
Squidward: Did someone say 'party'?
Strangler: I can't take it!
"SpongeBob:  Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!"
Strangler: Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac!
SpongeBob: I'm not safe! Come back!
"Strangler: Finally, away from that guy."
"SpongeBob:  Good idea, bodyguard. They’ll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!"
"Strangler: Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard!  I'm the Strangler! See?!"
SpongeBob:  The Strangler!
"Officer Nancy: Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars."
Strangler: At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.
"Patrick: Hey, Mac,  what're you in for?"
"Frankie Billy: Once around the roundabout.  Left at the wall.  Over the Bump of Truth.  And finally, the flaming hoop!  Thank you, Mrs. Puff, I am now a car daring figure and a producing member of society.  Woo-hoo! Yeah!"
"Mrs. Puff:  Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student."
"SpongeBob:  Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test.  Mrs. Puff, you okay?"
Mrs. Puff:  Just start driving.  Turn this boat around immediately!
"SpongeBob: Right away, ma’am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control..."
"Announcer: Next up, Goin' Bananas 3: In 3D."
"Teenage Fish #1: Hey, dude, pass the 3D glasses. This is supposed to be, like, in 3D."
"Teenage Fish #2:: Oh, yeah, right!"
Driver: Here I am! I'm coming at ya like your worst nightmare!
Teenage Fish #1 and #2:  Wow!
"Mrs. Puff: I think it's safe to say you have once again, failed your driving test!"
"SpongeBob:  Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-"
"Mrs. Puff: No buts, SpongeBob! You fail this test over and over! I'm beginning to think you are simply... unteachable!  Now, get out of my sight!"
"SpongeBob: I...I...  I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!"
"Teenage Fish: Dude, this is, like, the gnarliest 3-D movie ever!"
"Mrs. Puff: If only SpongeBob could pass his boating test, he'd be out of my life once and for all. Unfortunately, I keep getting reminded of the consequences if I get too angry with the little nuisance.  I can't even leave town without violating my parole.  If there was only some way that I didn't have to live in fear.  Fear! That's the answer! SpongeBob is afraid of the driving course! So it would stand to reason that if he took the driving test somewhere else besides the driving course, he would pass!  Of course! The answer's been in front of me all along! I'll test SpongeBob on a real road and then he'll be out of my life forever!  Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?"
"SpongeBob: Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth?  Come back later; I'm wallowing."
"Mrs. Puff: Good morning, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob:
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight."
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, that! Let's forget what I said. It's time to take a fresh approach."
"SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un-"
"Mrs. Puff: We don't have time for this, SpongeBob. We have a long day of driving ahead of us."
"SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?"
"Mrs. Puff: To overcome your fears, silly."
SpongeBob: It's not working!
Mrs. Puff: Here we are!
"SpongeBob: Uh, where are we?"
Mrs. Puff: This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.
SpongeBob: Dr-iving test?!
"Mrs. Puff: That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course.  Out here, there's nothing but the road.  Now, scooch over.  Come on. Scooch over."
"SpongeBob:  But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?"
"Mrs. Puff: Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat."
"SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!"
"Mrs. Puff: Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Got it?"
"SpongeBob: O-o-okay.  Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff."
Mrs. Puff: Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.
"SpongeBob: Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road."
Mrs. Puff: Boating within the lines.  Well done.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.
"Mrs. Puff: Finally using your turn signal, woohoo!  Check."
SpongeBob: Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.
"Mrs. Puff: Roundabout navigation, check!"
"SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
"Mrs. Puff: Safe and steady acceleration, check!"
SpongeBob: Focus on the road...  There is nothing but the road.
Mrs. Puff: Check...check...and...CHECK!  What is this?!
"Mrs. Puff: Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel."
"SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus...  on the...road? What happened to the road!?"
"Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!"
"SpongeBob: Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
Mrs. Puff: Just stop the boat!
"SpongeBob: Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh...  The road!"
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, wait!"
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBoooob!
SpongeBob: That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? This isn't just any road.  It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway!
SpongeBob: Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!
"Mrs. Puff: Stay calm, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! SpongeBob! Remember your mantra?"
"SpongeBob: Right. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road  I can't even see the road! ."
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob! Give me the wheel, SpongeBob. Oh, dear! He's completely frozen up!  Fiddlesticks!"
Police Officer: Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers.
"Police Officer: Pull over, you menace!"
"SpongeBob: Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?"
"Police Officer: I said, stop your vessel!"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes!"
"Police Officer: Uh, we got us a runner."
"Mrs. Puff: Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look!  No!"
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, hit the brakes!"
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh! Okay!
"Mrs. Puff: Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license!  And I'm free! Ha ha!"
Officer: I don't think so.
"Mrs. Puff: Is there a problem, officer?"
"Officer: Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am,  are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that."
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I'll get you for this! I'll get you!"
Plankton: Ha!
"Mr. Krabs: Hold it right there, Plankton."
Plankton: Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'll take that.
Plankton: How'd you know it was me?
"Mr. Krabs: Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it."
Plankton: Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.
Mr. Krabs: You think? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Wooo-ooo!
"Announcer:  3, 2, 1…, launch!"
Plankton: AAHH!
Plankton: Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!
"Sadie:  Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless."
"Plankton: Hey, I resent that! Huh?"
"Sadie:  Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it."
"Plankton: Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby."
"Mr. Krabs:  Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies!"
"Plankton: I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!  Oh, aren't you just too cute.  Coochie coochie coo!"
"Plankton: Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock."
"SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Plankton.  Here you go, little guy."
"Plankton: Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!  Hello."
SpongeBob:  Police! Police!
"Plankton:  Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  That was easy. I'm free! Free!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby!  It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula!  What do we do, Squidward?"
"Squidward: I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break."
Plankton:  …and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.
"Karen: Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time, spray SpongeBob, too."
Plankton: Not sure I follow you.
Karen: Listen carefully. Spray...
Plankton: Yes.
Karen: ...Sponge....
Plankton: Uh-huh.
Karen: ....Bob.....
Plankton: Right.
Karen: ....Too!
Plankton: Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.
Karen: That's just what I…
"Plankton: I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!"
"SpongeBob: Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s?"
Plankton: Hands in the air!
SpongeBob: Plankton!
"Plankton:  That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal?  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote!  One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult?  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!"
Mr. Krabs: Ahem!
"Plankton: Krabs! Nice diaper.  Hold on, hold on! I think I...  Yes, I've got it!"
Mr. Krabs:  Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo!
Mr. Krabs:  I can't tolerate your stinky gas!
Dennis:
Miss Shell: That makes two of us.
Dennis: I don't do it on purpose!
"Mr. Krabs: You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…a nother penny! Come to papa! Now, what were we doing?"
"Plankton: This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!"
"Mr. Krabs: Eh? What was that, sonny?"
"Plankton: Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless."
"SpongeBob: Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!"
Plankton: I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again!
SpongeBob: I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.
Plankton: This baby gas is worthless!  At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
"SpongeBob: What was that, sonny?"
Plankton: It'll take more time to explain than you have left.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs:  He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
SpongeBob: Catch who?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, Gesundheit."
Plankton: Victory is mine!
"SpongeBob: Come back here, you little whippersnapper!"
"Mr. Krabs: You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!"
SpongeBob: I'm catching up with my knitting.
"Mr. Krabs:  That's it! Knit, little nitwit!"
Plankton: That was almost too easy.  What? No! I demand you geezers release me!
Mr. Krabs: Right after the party. The piñata party.
Plankton: What?
Senior Citizens:  That's for calling us old.
"Plankton: Hey, quit it!"
Senior Citizens: I want candy!
Plankton: No!
"Plankton: One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it."
"Plankton: Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?"
Shubie: You mean the Kelp-O?
"Plankton: No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing."
Shubie: Are you talking about my baby? creep!
"Plankton: Ow, ow, ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow, ow, ow, ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!"
Karen: Just like all your other plans that couldn't possibly fail?
"Plankton: What is it now, Karen?"
Karen: I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!
Plankton: That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig!
"Karen:  Plankton, don't you dare!"
Plankton: Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!
"Plankton: Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch!"
"SpongeBob: What's wrong, little feller?"
Plankton: That was loud.
"Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life.  Well, you know."
"Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award.  Jellyfish, I got an award.  Island, I got an awar...  I gotta show SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  Hold still, Gary."
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done.
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award."
"SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?"
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob:  For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake."
"Patrick: But, it's shiny."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?"
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
"SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet."
Patrick: I want an award!
"SpongeBob:  Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day."
Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
SpongeBob: But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something."
Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
SpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Patrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
SpongeBob: Smaller.
Patrick: Doctor?
SpongeBob: Smaller.
Patrick: Fireman?
SpongeBob:  The smallest you can think of.
Patrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob:  Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.
Patrick: Then let's go.
"Patrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job."
"SpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?"
Squidward: Guess who just quit?
Patrick: Do I get my award yet?
"SpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?"
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob:  Pick up order!
"Patrick: Do I get my award, now?"
"SpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer."
Patrick: Ok.
SpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.
Patrick: Like that?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick:  Barnacles!
SpongeBob: Let's try something different.
SpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.
"Patrick: Aye aye, Captain!"
Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
"Patrick: No, this is Patrick."
Girl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
"Patrick:  No, this is Patrick!"
Another Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick:  No! This is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.
"SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant."
Patrick: Huh? Oh...Fishpaste!
SpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?
Patrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.
SpongeBob: You'll do fine.
Nat:  Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown?
"SpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick."
Delivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants.
Patrick: Why can't I do anything right?!
SpongeBob:  Kitchen!
"Patrick:  I'm never gonna get an award, now."
"SpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle."
Patrick: Yes.
"SpongeBob: You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!"
"SpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly."
"SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!"
"SpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it."
Patrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
"SpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?"
"SpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind."
"Patrick: Well, back to the ol' grind."
SpongeBob: Forget my hat.
"Patrick: Uh, me, too."
SpongeBob:
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Whew!
SpongeBob:  Dropped my spatula.
"Patrick: Uhh, me, too.  Ow!"
SpongeBob: Aha!  You're copying me!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Why are you doing that?
Patrick: So I can win an award like you.
"SpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!"
Patrick: Stop it.
"SpongeBob: Say, you're good."
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn.  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickle fish lips!  Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
SpongeBob:  At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick:  At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob and Patrick:
SpongeBob:  Stop copying me!
Patrick: There's no award for that!
"Squidward:  Well, I guess it's safe to go in now."
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?"
Patrick: Until I have as many awards as you.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
"Patrick: No, we won't."
SpongeBob:  I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
"Patrick: Me, too."
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me."
"Patrick: Oh, no, you don't!"
"SpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?"
Patrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.
Patrick: My turn!
"SpongeBob:  I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob."
Patrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
"SpongeBob: But, Patrick..."
Patrick: Patrick's not here!
Delivery Guy:  Trophy delivery!
SpongeBob: Another trophy?
"Patrick:  Oh, great!  What's it for THIS time?"
SpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
Patrick: Yay!  Eee!
"SpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?"
Patrick: I'm gonna go protect my title.
"Narrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock."
Plankton:  Wah!
"Karen:  Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic."
"Plankton: It's all about you today, Karen."
"Karen: Oh, this makes up of a lot of your stupidity lately, Plankton."
"Plankton:  Plankton's stepped away for a moment. The name's Ray Ray, and I am at your service, m'lady.  Pow!"
"Karen:  Oh, kiss me, pipsqueak. I mean, Ray Ray."
Plankton:  Grandma?! I told you never to call me on this screen.
"Lily Plankton: Sheldon,  is that you?"
"Plankton:  Yes, it's me, Grandma. Always nice to hear from you. Okay, gotta go."
"Lily Plankton: Okay, sweetie. See you tomorrow at 8 AM sharp."
"Plankton: Right, see you then. Wait a minute, what? 8 AM? Um, what's happening at 8 AM, Grandma?"
"Lily Plankton: Don't you remember, silly?  You promised me you'd own  the Krusty Krab by my 90th birthday. Well, my 90th is tomorrow! You do own the Krusty Krab now, right?"
"Plankton: Lie, that's it!  Uh, you're darn right I own the Krusty Krab, Grandma, and I can't wait to give you the grand tour, uh, tomorrow morning."
"Lily Plankton: Aww, see you then."
Karen:  That smack was for Plankton.  Now bring back Ray Ray.
"Plankton: Oh, what am I gonna do, Karen? How am I gonna fool Grandma tomorrow?"
"Karen: Oh, okay, I guess bath time is over.  Why don't you and Ray Ray take a long walk off a short plank?"
"Plankton:  Gotta think, gotta think.  Come on, brain!"
"SpongeBob:  This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty!  Whoo!  Whoop, whoop.  Ooh.  Aah.  Whew. ' Ow!"
"Plankton: SpongeBoob, you gotta help me."
"SpongeBob:  Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?"
"Plankton:  This is not an evil scheme.  The truth is I promised my grandma I would own the Krusty Krab by her 90th birthday. So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it?"
"SpongeBob:  Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it."
Mr. Krabs: I'm not gonna buy what?
French Narrator: One Pathetic Sob-Story Later...
Mr. Krabs: I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.
"Plankton: I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but..."
"Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye."
"SpongeBob: That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth."
"Mr. Krabs:  You know,  I have a grandma too."
SpongeBob: Aww.
"Mr. Krabs:  All right, I buy it."
Plankton: Thank you.
"Mr. Krabs: First things first.  That should keep it safe for six to eight hours.  All right, me pretties, let's make this place pro-Plankton pronto!"
"Mr. Krabs: Now everyone remember, for the rest of the day, Plankton is the—  Plankton's boss."
"Plankton: Hi, Grandma. Happy birthday."
"Karen: Nice to see you again, Grandma Plankton."
Lily Plankton:  Ugh. Who invited C-Pee-Eww?
"Karen:  All right, I tried."
"Plankton: Owuh!  Let me help you with your bag, Grandma.  Ouch!"
"Plankton: Well, here we are, Grandma. Welcome to the Krusty Plankton. I named it after you."
"Lily Plankton:  Oh, well, aren't you a sweet grandson?  Who are they?"
"Plankton: They're just my employees, Grandma. Meet SpongeBob and Eugene."
"SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hello, Grandma Plankton."
"Lily Plankton: They look like very nice boys, and I'll bet they're even nicer when they're working."
"Plankton: You heard, Grandma! We ain't running a welcome wagon here! Get back to work!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Yeah, sure thing, Plankton."
"Plankton:  That's Mr. Plankton to you, busboy."
"Mr. Krabs:  Sorry, Mr. Plankton. It won't happen again."
"Lily Plankton:  Oh, look, that one's napping on the job."
"Plankton:  Nap time's over, loafer!"
"Squidward:  Okay, who's the wise guy?"
"Lily Plankton:  Ohh.  Oh, my goodness! Who is this handsome young man?"
"Plankton: Oh, that's Squidward. He's nobody. Moving along..."
Lily Plankton:  Mm. Squidward. Didn't we meet at an early bird dinner?
"SpongeBob: Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer!  Ow!"
"Squidward:  All right, lady, I don't normally say this,  but get off my nose."
"Plankton:  Go along with it, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs:  Or you're fired.
"Squidward:  So, Grandma Plankton, where have you been all my life?"
Lily Plankton:  Call me Lily.
"Plankton: Okay, Grandma, you're embarrassing me now."
"Lily Plankton:  To the kitchen, Squidward."
"Plankton: Try one of our Planky Patties, Grandma. Fresh off the grill."
"Lily Plankton:  I'll need my teeth for this.  Whoops.  Oops. I dropped my choppers. Oh, well. I guess Squidward will have to chew it for me."
"Squidward: Oh, sure, I'll—what?!  Aah."
"Lily Plankton:  That's it, chew it up real good. That's enough. My turn."
Squidward: Aah.
Lily Plankton: Aah.  Delicious.
"SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton:  Ew!"
"Lily Plankton: Oh, Sheldon, you've outdone yourself. You really are a master chef."
"Lily Plankton: Thank you, Sheldon.  You've really made my birthday something extra special this year."
"Plankton: All right, Grandma.  Got your bag? You are out the door and that is that."
"Lily Plankton:  Oh, just one more thing."
Lily Plankton: My last birthday wish is to get a photo of me posing with the Krabby Patty secret formula.
Plankton:  Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Anything to get that bag with the bag out of here.
"SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward:  Say cheese."
Plankton and Lily Plankton: Cheese.
Lily Plankton: Ahhh!
"Lily Plankton:  Finally, the secret formula is mine!"
"Mr. Krabs: I knew your sincerity was insincere, sir!"
"Plankton: I didn't know anything about this, Eugene, honest! But I love it! Now we can rule the world as a family, eh, Grandma?"
"Lily Plankton:  Sorry, Sheldon, but I'm not sharing the formula with you!"
Plankton:  But Grandma!
"Lily Plankton: Adios, mi amour! Mmmm."
Plankton: Why? Why did I lie?
SpongeBob: Why? Why did I pretend?
Mr. Krabs: Why?  Why did I give her my formula?
Squidward:  Why? Why wouldn't we be open on Tuesday? Idiot!
"SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: What have we done?"
Lily Plankton: I have the secret formula!  This world is mine!
Everyone:  Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!
"Lily Plankton:  Darling,  why don't you toss the peasants a little something?"
Fred: My leg!
"Mr. Krabs:  I'll take that, thank you very much.  Safe and sound."
"Plankton:  Happy birthday, Grandma."
SpongeBob: Huh...Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Whaddya wanna do today?
Patrick: I don't know.
"SpongeBob: Well, I guess we could play something.  How about a yo--?"
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Yo.  Buried Treasure Board Game?
Patrick: Nah.
SpongeBob: Dollies?
Patrick: Hm..... nope.  No.  Nope. Nope. Uh-uh. No. Nah.
SpongeBob:  How about this?
Old Man Walker: Hello.
Patrick: Uh-uh.
"SpongeBob:  Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy."
"Patrick:  Yeah, that'll happen."
"SpongeBob:  Ugh, there is just nothing to play with."
Patrick: There's gotta be something we can do.
Squidward:  Ladda-de ladd-dum ladda-do... Hey! What are you doing in my house?
"SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?"
Squidward: Get out!
Patrick: We already thought of that one.
Squidward:  I believe this pile belongs to you.
"Old Man Walker: Where are we goin' now, boys?"
SpongeBob:
Patrick: Ugh. I'm so bored. There's gotta be something we can do!
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  It's Coming?  Oh, boy! ♪It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!♪"
Patrick:  Almost there!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're almost there!
Patrick:  Here it is!
SpongeBob:  Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest...  Toy store?!  Ahhhhh!
Patrick: Ohhhhh!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! Whoooo!
"SpongeBob: Well, we're here."
Patrick: But where's the toy store?
"SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's not open yet."
Patrick: Not...open?
Construction worker:  What are you cryin' about?
"Patrick: We wanted to go to the toy store, but it's not open yet!"
"Construction worker: Well, it's open now. Look!  See? Feel better now?"
Patrick: Mm-hm.
Construction worker: Then quit yer cryin' and get in there!
"SpongeBob: I got it.  Patrick! Patrick, get up..."
"Patrick: Uh, no thanks. I'm good down here."
"SpongeBob: Look.  Wow!  Patrick, look at that."
Patrick: Wow.
Steve the Cashier: Can I help you?
SpongeBob: That depends. Tell me. Do you like to  sing?!
"Steve: Oh, no."
SpongeBob: Ahem!  ♪La...
Narrator: Several song-filled hours later...
"SpongeBob: ♪Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah!♪ Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick:  Hey, SpongeBob. What’s with the tutu?"
SpongeBob: It's not a tutu! It's a man-tu! You can tell because it has  extra support.  I got the last one.
Patrick: Uh-huh.
Fish: Aaahhhhhhhhh!
SpongeBob: What a great day! I hope it never ends!
Patrick: Never!
"Voice on loudspeaker: Attention, shoppers, the store is now closed. Please exit immediately."
Baby:  But I don't wanna go!
Timmy:  Dad! I want it!  No!  Ah!
SpongeBob: Aw. The store's closing. We'll have to leave now.
Patrick: What part of never don't you understand?
"SpongeBob: Patrick, we have to leave."
Patrick: Huh! I'm not moving.
SpongeBob: But they'll just come and kick us out!
Patrick: Not if we hide.
SpongeBob: Hide? Isn't that kinda sneaky?
"Patrick: Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?"
SpongeBob: No. But I do now. What do we do first?!
Patrick: We need to find a hiding spot where they'll never find us. And I know just the place.
Guard worm:
"Security guard: Come on, boy. Let's go. The store is empty, so go ahead and lock 'er up, Frank."
Steve: My name is Steve.
"Security guard: Whatever floats your boat, Frank."
"Patrick: The coast is clear.  Push, SpongeBob! Push! Push, man, push!  Okay, SpongeBob, gimme your hand. That's my boy. Brace yourself."
"SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. Well, we did it. Yay!"
"Patrick: Yay! Oh, this is so awesome."
SpongeBob: Nothing can ruin it!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, is that you?"
Patrick: What?
"SpongeBob: I said, Is that you?"
Patrick: I can't hear you! It's too dark in here! Don't worry. I'll just use my Night Vision.
SpongeBob: You have Night Vision?
Patrick:  Yeah.
SpongeBob: How long have you had that?
Patrick: Remember that flashlight I shoved up my ear?
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah."
"Patrick: Well, I guess it worked its way into my brain.  Shoot! The batteries are dead! It's dark... and scary!"
"SpongeBob: Calm down, buddy. We just need to find a light switch. But ya have to put me down first."
"Patrick: Yeah. Right, SpongeBob. I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns all peachy!"
SpongeBob: Yes.
"Patrick: Look around you, SpongeBob! We're surrounded!"
SpongeBob: By... toys?
Patrick: That...want...to...get us.
SpongeBob:  Gah!  Eeeeeeee!
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Aaahhhhhh!  Aaahhhh!
.
Patrick: Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: Are we going to the ladies’ room again?
SpongeBob: No. We're going to fight back and we are going to win!
SpongeBob and Patrick: .
Patrick: That was fun! Now let's dress up like fairy princesses!
.
"SpongeBob: Ready, Patrick?"
Patrick: Let's get some!
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Nothing can stop it!
"SpongeBob: It was nice knowin' ya, pal."
Patrick: I know. I'm an interesting guy.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whew!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, don't!"
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick:
Steve:  The Toy Barrel is now open for business. Prepare for more fun than you've ever had.
Kids:
SpongeBob and Patrick:
SpongeBob: My eyes!
"Patrick:  With Neptune as my witness, may you never experience the unholy terrors that are inside that store. Hey, they're open!  I love toys!"
Plankton:  I surrender!
"Mr. Krabs: Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work."
"Plankton: There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?"
"Mr. Krabs: What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me."
"Plankton: Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!"
Mr. Krabs: But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
Plankton: Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!
"Mr. Krabs:  Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?"
Plankton: What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
"Mr. Krabs: Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer."
"Plankton: Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!"
Mr. Krabs: You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
Plankton: No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
"Mr. Krabs:  Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?"
"Plankton: I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum."
"Mr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down."
"Plankton: Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career."
SpongeBob: What's going on Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
"SpongeBob: Whatever you say, cap'n."
Mr. Krabs: Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?
"Plankton: Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items."
"Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game."
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium."
"Mr. Krabs:  Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere."
"SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there."
"Mr. Krabs: Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf."
"SpongeBob: That's some good news, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Right away, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Squidward: This is idiotic.
Mr. Krabs: Dance or you're fired.
"Squidward: You got it, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs:  How do you like them apples, you little..."
"Plankton:  Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop."
"Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war."
Plankton:  Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.
"Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me."
"Plankton: Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?"
Mr. Krabs: Grr...
Plankton: But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
Mr. Krabs: Bubkes.
"Plankton: Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways."
"Mr. Krabs: Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it."
"Plankton: Thanks, but no."
"Mr. Krabs: A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?"
"Plankton: Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine."
"Mr. Krabs: Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive!  SEE?! Who's the one with the problem?!"
Plankton: Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
"Mr. Krabs: Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow."
Plankton:  Get out!
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops."
"Plankton: What's this?  Hey, Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come back.
Plankton: You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.
Mr. Krabs: I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!
"Plankton: Coming, coming.  Yo."
"Mr. Krabs: Uh, Plankton?"
Plankton: Eugene?
"Mr. Krabs: Uh, hey."
Plankton: Hey.
"Mr. Krabs: Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?"
Plankton: Yes. I'm still here.
"Mr. Krabs: Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?"
Plankton: Sure.
"Mr. Krabs: Glad you could make it, buddy."
"Plankton: So, what's this about, Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over."
"Plankton: Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won."
"Mr. Krabs: Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton."
"Plankton: Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you."
"Mr. Krabs: That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%."
"Plankton: Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me."
"Mr. Krabs: And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something."
"Plankton: Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts."
"Mr. Krabs: No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula."
Plankton: I can't believe you would even think...
Mr. Krabs: Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
"Plankton: You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt."
"Mr. Krabs: Come on, take it."
"Plankton: You sure?  Life is good, Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Sure is, buddy. Sure is."
"Plankton: Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician."
Mr. Krabs: I'd never give you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.
"SpongeBob:  Get up, Patrick! It's time!"
Patrick:  Time for what?
SpongeBob: The big shin-dig! Remember?
"Patrick: No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today."
"SpongeBob: That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship."
"Patrick: The beach! Just you and me!?  So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine!  I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend.
Guy on Bus: You're hurting me!
SpongeBob:  Guess what?
Person in front of him (Harold):  What?
SpongeBob: I'm going to the beach with my best friend!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!
Bus driver:  What?
"SpongeBob: Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?"
Bus driver: I don't care.
"SpongeBob: You know what this situation calls for. Patrick!  A few verses of the best friend tune! ♪Ohhhh best fr-♪  Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are."
Patrick: I knew it! We've been abandoned!
SpongeBob: No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here!
"Volleyball player:  A little help, bro?"
"SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!"
Patrick: Small plastic disc that you throw!  I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
"SpongeBob: I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name."
Patrick: Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
"SpongeBob: Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll  toss it to you!"
Patrick:  Ha ha ha ha.
SpongeBob: Ready?!
Nat: Ha ha ha! That's why they call it a sandwich!
"Patrick:  I caught it!  Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?"
"Life Guard:  I can assure you, that was not cool! Just look at what you've done! Your buffoonery has destroyed the lifeguard tower! Why don't you find something to do that's less obnoxious?"
Patrick: Like what?
"Life Guard: I don't know, go play in the sand or something!"
"Patrick: Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring."
"SpongeBob: Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or..."
"Patrick: Boring, SpongeBob, boring!"
"SpongeBob: I know, we can make sand castles!"
Patrick: That sounds  un-boring!
"SpongeBob: No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?"
Patrick:  Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
"SpongeBob: Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over."
Patrick: Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
"SpongeBob: I'm just trying to help, buddy!"
"Patrick: Well, I don't need any help."
Patrick's Architect: Here are those architectural plans you requested.
Patrick: Why thank you. Here's a little something for you.
"SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side."
"Patrick:  Now, we're even!"
"SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, have it your way.  You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine."
"Patrick:  Now, this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle!"
"SpongeBob:  I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh, sir, you built onto my side."
Patrick: So?
"SpongeBob:  So, you don't do that!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border."
Patrick: You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for!
SpongeBob: But what for what!?
"Patrick:  Now, we're even... again!"
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?"
Patrick: This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on!
"SpongeBob: Oh, is that so!? Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on!  Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off."
Patrick: No way! You started it.
SpongeBob: Fine! Have it your way.
Patrick:  Whatever.  No no no no no.  Oh hello! And goodbye.
SpongeBob: Come on!  How do you like them apples?
Patrick:  You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
"SpongeBob:  Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?"
Patrick:  I like you this much!  Feel me!
SpongeBob:  Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
Patrick:  The question is... will you be!?  No fair!
"SpongeBob:  All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun!"
"Beach Onlooker:  What was that!? Come on, we got to get out of here!"
"Patrick:  Oh, yeah? Two can play at this game!"
SpongeBob:  Jumping jellyfish! WHOA!
"Patrick: I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice."
"Gryphon:  Let's beat it, dude!"
SpongeBob:  Ohhhh.
Patrick:  Ohhhh. What happened?
"SpongeBob: I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away."
"Patrick: Me, too...was it worth it?"
"SpongeBob: No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson."
Lifeguard: Let's also not forget who's going to clean this place up.
"SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Oooh, uhhhh, ahhhh..."
Lifeguard:  Better get started! You've got a lot of work to do.
Patrick: I bet I can clean up faster than you!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
"Patrick: Yes, I can!"
"SpongeBob: No, I can!"
"Patrick: Oh, I can!"
SpongeBob: I can!
"Patrick: Hey, look at this!"
Squidward:  Closing time. The happiest time of the day!
"SpongeBob: Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over."
Mr. Krabs:  What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!
Pinch-o-matic: Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.
"SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill."
"Mr. Krabs: And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun."
SpongeBob: But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
Mr. Krabs: You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
Narrator: The next day...
"SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward."
"Squidward:  Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders."
"Squidward: Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?
Squidward: What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
"Mr. Krabs: Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?"
SpongeBob: Because it growled at me.
"Mr. Krabs: You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No... no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then...  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!
"Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare."
"Mr. Krabs: So I'm gonna be okay, doc?"
"Purple Doctorfish: Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart.  Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no!  Oh no, this is terrible!"
"Mr. Krabs: Everything okay, doc?"
Purple Doctorfish: Don't touch me!
Mr. Krabs: That's not a good sign.
"Flying Dutchman: Har, har har har har har har har har har!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!"
"Flying Dutchman: Eugene Krabs, your time has come."
"Mr. Krabs: I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!"
"Flying Dutchman: Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room.  Excuse me, nurse?"
Nurse:  Yes?
Flying Dutchman: I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
"Nurse: Oh, he's in that room right there."
"Flying Dutchman: No, that's Harold Flower's room."
Nurse:  Harold Flower?
"Flying Dutchman: So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?"
Mr. Krabs: What do you want from me?
Flying Dutchman: I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
"Flying Dutchman: Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!  Here we are."
Mr. Krabs:  Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Flying Dutchman: Davy Jones works out a lot.  These are his socks. Get in!
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!"
"Flying Dutchman: Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity."
Mr. Krabs:  Mommy!
"Flying Dutchman: Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap."
Mr. Krabs: You have me word as a sailor.
Squidward:  Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.
"SpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!"
"Squidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys!"
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?"
"Squidward:  Well, it was."
"Mr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?"
Monroe: A Krabby Patty.
"Mr. Krabs:  Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?"
Monroe: I don't go hungry?
"Mr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy!"
"Monroe: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad."
"Mr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'."
Mr. Krabs:  Great!
"Martha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?"
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob: Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility..."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
"SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir."
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?
"Squidward: Eugene, my man."
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?
"Squidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?"
"Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?"
Harold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
Mr. Krabs:  No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
"Squidward:  Here's your mail, Eugene."
"Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested."
"Squidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me."
"Mr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And...there's no money in here.  How delightful."
"SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs."
"Squidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon."
Squidward: Uh... dream?
Mr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
"SpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning."
Squidward: Here's the bill.
"Mr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!"
"Nathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!"
Mr. Krabs:  Your luck just ran out!
"Nathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm."
"Mr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off."
Flying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!
"Mr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!"
Squidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
"Mr. Krabs:  Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go."
SpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!
Flying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
"SpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea."
Flying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
SpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
"Flying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?"
"Mr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?"
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman:  62 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'll take the money.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
"Flying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Look, Squidward, money!"
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?"
Mr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?
Squidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!"
"Flying Dutchman: Here, take him back."
Mr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?
"Flying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!"
"SpongeBob:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!"
Flying Dutchman: He's your problem now.
"Mr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change..."
"SpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing."
Mr. Krabs: You would have?
SpongeBob: No.
Flying Dutchman:  Dutchman's residence.
"SpongeBob:  So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink."
"SpongeBob:  ♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love cookin' me some Krabby Patties! Feedin' all the children and the mommies and the daddies! Love servin' up the most delicious dish, but before I can, gotta add a little of this!♪  Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce.  Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. Use on or before the date printed below.  This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!"
"SpongeBob: Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy."
"Mr. Krabs:  Hmm. Future generations, huh?"
"Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy!  All right, you guys got donations covered, right?"
"SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!"
Squidward: Whatever.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
"SpongeBob: The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the..."
Squidward: Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee.
Mr. Krabs: And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
"Billy: But, this thing's made out of rusty old paper clips and cardboard!"
Mr. Krabs: All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?
Billy:  Deal!
"SpongeBob: What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading."
"Sadie: Why, thank you, young man!"
"Squidward: No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?"
"Sadie: Well, actually, I..."
"Squidward:  Hmm. Oh, whatever shall I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about  this lamp?! It's  perfect!"
"Sadie: Wow, you're good. How did you know all that? Are you like a psychic? Oh, oh, oh! Tell me what I'm thinking!"
Squidward: Next.
"SpongeBob:  Hey, nice pass, Squidward!"
"Squidward: Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?"
"Man: Uh, it works good when I eat stuff."
"Squidward: Right. This plate is actually not meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity."
"Man: Uh, okay."
Squidward:  Uh-huh.  Interesting.  This is a promising sign. Yep.  You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
Man: Really?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob:  You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
Squidward: Next.
SpongeBob:  A four-striped sock! Incredible!
French Narrator: 2 hours later...
"SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone."
"Patrick:  SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger."
"SpongeBob: Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?"
Patrick: Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
SpongeBob: After you then!
"Patrick: Thank you, my good man."
"Squidward: Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...?"
"Patrick: Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now."
"Squidward: Oh, no, you don't!"
"SpongeBob: You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would."
"Patrick: What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, you're very good at that!"
Mr. Krabs: And thanks so much for all your contributions! So are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?!
Plankton: Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop-- a stupid time capsule.
"Mr. Krabs: But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!"
Plankton:  There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery!
Mr. Krabs:  Send her down!
"SpongeBob:  He shoots, he scores!"
Squidward:  Get off me!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what are you doing?"
"Patrick: Yeah, it looks fun!"
"Squidward: WE JUST GOT BURIED ALIVE, YOU IDIOTS!"
"SpongeBob: I know, but what are you doing?"
"Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry?"
SpongeBob: Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
"Patrick: I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years."
Patrick:  50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
SpongeBob: I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here!  It's our favorite game!
Both: Pretzel Pals!
Patrick: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
"SpongeBob: Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?"
Patrick: I believe my left hand was on red.
SpongeBob: My right foot was on blue.
Patrick: Forehead on yellow.
SpongeBob: Left foot on green. [kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick
"Squidward: That's it, this game is over!"
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?"
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
"Future Fish: Welcome to the future, history person. During your absence, our society has achieved numerous advances we're sure you'll find to be quite impressive.  Well?"
"SpongeBob:  Wow, a water fountain for short people! What will the future think of next?"
"Patrick: Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with a perfect blend of commerce and irrigation.  Not to mention the breathtaking views."
"SpongeBob: Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?"
"Future Octopus:  His art embodies the soul that our society has lost. And it is here,  the location of the suffering that inspired that art that we place the Squidward Tentacles Memorial Museum!"
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?
Plankton:  Jackpot! And now to extract the secret recipe.  Careful. Careful.
"SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Sixteen Bikini Bottom, nineteen Bikini Bottom, twenty! Ready or not, here we..."
"Patrick: Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out.  Whipped cream!  Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful!  Sha-veeng g-el. I've always wanted a beard!"
"SpongeBob: Me too!  Do you want one too, Squidbeard?"
Squidward:  Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already?  Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!
"Plankton:  Secret recipe, where are you? Aha!"
"Squidward: Hello, future!  Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years!"
"Plankton: Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe!"
Squidward:  Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.
"Karen: Don't hurt yourself, Poopsy."
"Plankton: Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes."
"Narrator: Ahhh... The Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's answer to fine dining. And here we see one of its patrons now.  Ah... yes, moving on. Oh, it is the SpongeBob, creator of the fine cuisine within. Now let us watch."
"Squidward: One Krabby Patty, extra grease."
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Squidward: Mmm.
SpongeBob: Ooh!
Squidward:
SpongeBob:
Squidward: Grr...
SpongeBob:
"Squidward: All right, let me see it.  The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?"
"SpongeBob:  What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred."
"Squidward: Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories."
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?"
"Squidward: Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well."
Squidward: Yes?!
"SpongeBob: Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?"
Squidward: So what?
SpongeBob: How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?
Squidward: I hear you crying all the time.
"SpongeBob: Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy."
"Squidward: Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone."
"Sandals: Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please.  Okay... can someone else take my order?"
Sandals:  I'll wait.
"Squidward:  You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible!"
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory."
Squidward:  Really? Do you think you can?
SpongeBob:  No problem.
"Squidward: Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay."
"SpongeBob: You love music, right, Squidward?"
Squidward: Mmm hmm.
SpongeBob: Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!
"Squidward: Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!"
SpongeBob: See? Your happiest memory is forming!
SpongeBob: Oops. That was a sour note.
Squidward: This is not my happiest memory...
Squidward: Why are we at the Art Museum?
"SpongeBob: Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!"
Squidward: Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?
"Curator:  Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece!"
SpongeBob: Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!
Squidward:  Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!
SpongeBob: Your happiest memory?
Squidward: Yeah!
Curator: And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece
Squidward: Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!
Fiasco: Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light...  of my flamethrower!
Squidward: And now he's melted it...  Not a happiest memory...
SpongeBob: Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!
SpongeBob: What a majestic view!
Squidward: What view?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward:  Very nice... except that I'm  afraid of heights!
SpongeBob: Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down!
Squidward:  What?! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...
Harold:  Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here!  You plant it!  All that time and money and resources wasted on...
SpongeBob: Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!
Squidward:  Uh oh...
Harold: Stupid amateurs...  Fantastic...
"Squidward: Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead..."
Narrator: Two weeks later...
"SpongeBob:  Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!"
Gary:
SpongeBob:  Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!
Gary: Meow...
SpongeBob: Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?
Gary: Meow?
"SpongeBob: Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? Hello!?  Hello?"
"Squidward: I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?"
"SpongeBob:  Hi, Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?"
Squidward: Yes...  Thanks for stopping by.
Gary: Sigh... meow.
"SpongeBob: Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!"
Squidward:  I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.
Mailfish: I have a package for a Squidward Tentaclees?
Squidward: Tentacles. Yes that's me.
"Mailfish: Well, here you go."
"Squidward: Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  Gotcha! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!?"
"SpongeBob: Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?"
Squidward: You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... want... a... happiest memory!
SpongeBob:  So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?
"Squidward:  I feel wonderful!  This is it, my happiest memory!"
SpongeBob: Sigh... he's so handsome!
"Patrick:  No, no!  Yay!"
"Nerd: Well, if only Inaudible Lad were here right now."
Patrick: Oh.  Nothing satisfies like a good story.
"SpongeBob:  Are ya ready to go, Patrick?"
"Patrick:  Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me!"
Patrick: Sponge--
"SpongeBob: Ew, what's this?"
"Patrick:  Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it!  SpongeBob, what do all these words say?"
SpongeBob: It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
Patrick: That's me!
SpongeBob:  Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Patrick: I never thought about anything!
SpongeBob:  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
"Patrick: I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!"
"SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet?"
"Patrick: Hey, look.  I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record."
"SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money!"
Patrick:  It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that.
SpongeBob: Patrick.
"Comic Book Store Clerk: Hey, you going to pay for those comics?"
SpongeBob: No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back?
"Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece."
SpongeBob: Good luck.  Coming--
"Patrick: SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work?"
Patrick:  SpongeBob! This pencil is broken! Why won't it make words?
SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself.
Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once.
"Young Patrick: A Poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom."
"Gym Teacher: How many times do I gotta tell ya, this is gym class!"
"Patrick:  Ohh, dodgeballs."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Patrick!"
Patrick:  Don't hit me with a dodgeball!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
"Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once."
SpongeBob:  No!
"Patrick: Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?!"
"SpongeBob:  You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?"
Patrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
"SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?"
Gary:  Meow.
"Patrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain."
"SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window."
"Patrick:  Come on, you stupid brain! work!  It's working!"
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, don't strain yourself."
"Squidward: Now, what's going on?  What is that horrible smell?  Is Patrick thinking again?"
Patrick: I'm making art!
"Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died."
Patrick: That's the creative process at work!  Ready to go to the post office?  I need to mail in my masterpiece.

Mr. Krabs: I thought those things ate mostly kibble.

Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Sure.

SpongeBob:
"Mr. Krabs: What, what?!"
SpongeBob: We're all out of Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Did you check the freezer?!
"SpongeBob: I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!"
Mr. Krabs: What about the freezer in the attic?
SpongeBob: We don't have an attic.
Mr. Krabs: No attic?!

"Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah."
"Plankton: Now what are they saying, Karen? Karen?!"
Karen: I have no idea.
Plankton: What? I thought you said you could read lips!
"Karen: I can, but you took my telescope away!"

SpongeBob: A fresh batch?
Mr. Krabs: That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
"Plankton: Okay, now what's he saying?"
Karen: He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.

"Plankton: Look, I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?"
Gary: Meow.
"Plankton: Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be..."
SpongeBob:  Gary! The bath is ready!
"Plankton: ...all yours! Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course."
SpongeBob:  Gary! Your bath is ready!
"Plankton: Have a pleasant stay! Bon voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!"
"SpongeBob:  Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for Bring your pet to work day! And today is the day!  First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
Plankton: Wha...?
"SpongeBob: Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?"
Plankton: Ugh...
SpongeBob:  Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime!
Plankton:
"SpongeBob:  Bet that feels good, huh?"
Plankton:  Curses! I mean... meow?
"SpongeBob:  Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?"
"Plankton: I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow!"
SpongeBob:  Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
"Plankton: No, I'm not."
SpongeBob:  We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
"Plankton: Pet hospital?! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!"
"SpongeBob: You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick.  Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?"
Plankton:  Meow?
SpongeBob: Is that yes? Or no?
Sadie: I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!
Plankton: Intensive care unit?
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals."
"Plankton:  Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else."
Sadie:  Don't worry. We're just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it.
"Jennifer-Millie: Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests."
Purple Doctorfish:  That's not what I'm saying at all.
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Gary!"
"Purple Doctorfish:  Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can. We just can't find out anything wrong with him. I've never seen anything like it."
"SpongeBob: Please try to save him, doctor!"
Plankton:  No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...
"Sadie: Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill."
Plankton: Whew! That's a relief.
"Sadie:  Now, open wide."
"Sadie: That wasn't so bad, was it?  That's not good.  Uh, Mr. SquarePants?"
SpongeBob:  Gary!
Sadie: The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.
"SpongeBob: You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh.  Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end."
Plankton: If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go...
"SpongeBob: Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know, it's... it's really poignant."
Plankton: What is?
"SpongeBob: Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you!"
"Plankton:  Oh, boy..."
"Tourist: So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon."
"SpongeBob:  Just a little further, Gare-Bare."
Gary:
Plankton: Yes!
"SpongeBob:  Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear."
"Plankton: Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!"
"Plankton: Mommy? Hey, wait!"
Mr. Krabs: Plankton?
"Plankton: Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going already!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, he takes after you, boy.  Pay?!"
Kid #1: It's too high. I can't!
Kid #2: Cannonball!
Kid #1: Ohh!
Water wing girl's mother: Now you've got water wings. Try them.  Hmm? Huh?
Water wing girl: Ahh-ahh-ahh!
SpongeBob:  Marco!
Swimmer: Ehh.
SpongeBob:  Marco?
"Joshua:  No, I'm Joshua."
"SpongeBob:  Okay, bye.  Marco."
Patrick:  Polo.
SpongeBob: Marco!
"Nurse:  Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!"
Old Man #1: I pooped.
"Clarabelle: Come along, Mortimer."
Patrick: Huh?  Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.
"Clarabelle: Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies.  Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today."
"Patrick: Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh!  Wait for me!"
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco!  Marco?
"Marco:  Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick."
Marco: Then stop a-yellin' my name!
SpongeBob: Ugh.  Marco.
"Larry:  Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him?"
"Patrick: Come on, let's move it! I want prune ice cream."
Senior Citizens:  Ohh.
"Clarabelle: Mortimer, ice cream time."
Patrick:  Ahh!  Brain freeze!
Nurse: Clear!  Clear!
Patrick: Oh.  Ah.  Brain food.
Clarabelle: Eh?
Mary: Ehh?
Patrick:  Eh.  Oh.
Old lady #1: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Marco!
SpongeBob: Marco!
Marco: You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?
"SpongeBob: Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance.  I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?"
Marco: My parents had a white farmhouse.
SpongeBob: What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
Marco: That's-a me. I was-a born there.
SpongeBob: They are about to name the boy...
Marco: Marco. They named him Marco. It's Marco. Marco!
SpongeBob: Polo.
"Marco: Ahh!  If I catch anyone a-yellin' my name again, I'm-a gonna hurt them."
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo!  Marco.
Patrick: Polo.
SpongeBob: Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.
"Patrick:  Do I know you, young man?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪"
Patrick: I don't know. A wizard?
SpongeBob:  ♪Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪  Ehh.
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants!
"SpongeBob:  The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo."
"Patrick: Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff."
SpongeBob: Old stuff? Like what?
"Patrick:  Check it out.  This is called doddering.  Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming.  Neat, huh?  Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining.  These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing?"
"Patrick:  Ohh! No, that hurts."
SpongeBob: We could build sandcastles.
Patrick:  It's not structurally sound.
"SpongeBob: Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles?  Nothing bad about a bubble."
"Patrick:  Ooh.  Are you trying to kill me, son?"
"SpongeBob: No, I just think we should act our age.  Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?"
"Patrick: These days, I only look forward to my final exit."
"Clarabelle: Oh, he was too young."
"Patrick:  No, I wasn't!"
"Senior Citizens: No, he wasn't.  We are not young."
"SpongeBob: Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh."
"Old Man #2: Fresh, you say? Ahh."
"SpongeBob: Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree."
"SpongeBob:  Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!"
Old Man #3: Is it nap time yet?
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
SpongeBob: Are you ready to get down?
Patrick and the senior citizens: Yeah.
"SpongeBob: No, not like that. Like this!"
Patrick: Now-now-now-now you're talking.
"SpongeBob: Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches!  Yeah!"
"Patrick: Oh, what's happening?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, clear!"
SpongeBob: Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
Old Lady #2: Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
Patrick and the senior citizens: Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
"SpongeBob: Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease, and sugar."
Patrick: You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams!  Now that's what I call jazz!
"SpongeBob:  Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this."
SpongeBob: I can help you with that.  Eww.
Old Man #1: Hey!
"SpongeBob: Old people, behave!"
Old Man #1:  Whoa!  23 skidoo!
SpongeBob: Oh.
Patrick:  SpongeBob!  I'm drowning!
"SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick!"
"Patrick: Thanks, old-timer."
"SpongeBob: Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer?  Whoa. Where have the years gone?  I'm losing steam."
"Patrick: Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends.  Oh.  Ohh. Now I can't dodder."
"Patrick: Here you go, old friend.  Huh?"
SpongeBob:  Gotcha!
Patrick: You got me again.
Clarabelle: Marco.
Old Man #3: Polo.
Clarabelle: Marco!
"Marco:  Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!"
"Clarabelle: No one clobbers Clarabelle!  Oh, Marco?"
Marco:  Polo.
Patrick: Giddy-up! Hyah!
"SpongeBob: Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, those are hash browns."
Patrick: Hash browns!
"SpongeBob: Um, Patrick, the slides."
"Patrick: Right. The slides.  Voila! Uh, now what?"
SpongeBob: Now you put the slides in the projector.
"Patrick:  I knew that. Put the slides in the projec--  ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better.  Okay, here we go.  There I was..."
"SpongeBob:  Ooh, a shadow puppet show!"
"Patrick: Please, no interruptions."
SpongeBob: Sorry.
"Patrick: As I was saying...  I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door.  For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?"
"Patrick:  I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest! I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.  It's so exhausting.  Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me."
"SpongeBob: Pal, what you need is a vacation."
Patrick: That's it! I need a vacation!
"Travel Agent: So, you'd like a vacation."
"Patrick:  Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--"
"SpongeBob:  Yes, he'd like a vacation."
"Travel Agent: Well, your options are endless, Mr. Star. Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris. It all depends on your budget."
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ugh!
Patrick: I guess I'll just have to stay home.
SpongeBob: Stay home? That's it! You can take a stay-cation.
Patrick: Wh-what's that?
"SpongeBob: Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free."
"Patrick: Oh, boy!"
"SpongeBob: All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation."
"Patrick: That's what I'm gonna do, buddy."
"SpongeBob:  Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?"
Patrick: I don't know. Can you?
"SpongeBob: Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star.  Patrick Star, room 801.  Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.  May I take your bags, Mr. Star?"
Patrick: I don't have any ba--  Oh...
"SpongeBob: Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way.  Your room, sir."
"Patrick: Oh, dear."
"SpongeBob: Something wrong, Mr. Star?"
"Patrick: Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged."
SpongeBob: Arranged?
Narrator: One Hour Later.
"SpongeBob: Mr. Star, are you sure about this?"
"Patrick: No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls.  I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!"
SpongeBob:  The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.
Patrick: Ah a pool!  Where's the diving board?
"SpongeBob: The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up.  Your diving board, sir."
Patrick: All right!
"SpongeBob: You okay, sir?"
"Patrick:  My head is swimming just fine, thank you."
"SpongeBob: Oh, no!  Lifeguard on duty!  You okay, sir?"
Patrick:  So cold.
SpongeBob: This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.
Patrick: So weak.  Strength... returning.  But I'm still hungry.
"SpongeBob: Follow me, sir.  If you would take your seat, sir.  Your dining bib, sir."
Patrick: Wow. What luxury.
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty coming up.
"Mr. Krabs:  What, no tip?"
"Patrick: Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir.  Presenting the SpongeBob Follies!  What the hey."
Patrick: Boring.  Lame.
"Man: Three, two, one, liftoff."
"SpongeBob: Well, what do you think?"
Patrick: You are smokin'!
"SpongeBob: Aw, it was nothing."
"Patrick: No, no, you're really smoking!"
"SpongeBob: What?  Oh, no, the Krabby Patty!"
Patrick: My tummy is still lonely.  Ahh.
"Squidward:  Ah.  Ah, delish.  Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin.  And now an elegant meal for an elegant person."
Patrick: I am quite refined.  Ah!
Squidward: What are you doing here?
"Patrick: I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey, waiter...  a napkin, please."
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Star, your meal is ready.  Patrick, where is he?  Ah!"
"Squidward: Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!"
Patrick: Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa.  I could use a massage.
"Squidward: Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!"
"Patrick:  Oh, yeah, that's the spot.  Hey, you should get a massage, too."
Squidward:  Not likely.  Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?!  Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet.
Narrator: 5 Hours Later.
"SpongeBob: So tired.  Patrick, what are you doing here?"
"Patrick: That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob."
"Mr. Krabs: Wake up, laddy."
"SpongeBob: Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: You have another nasty old dream?
SpongeBob: Mm-mmm.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick in your bed again?
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Krabs: Aye. Well, good night, laddy."
"SpongeBob: Good night, sir."
Voice: SB-129.
"Narrator: Ahh, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your ear plugs ready."
Squidward:  I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music.  Yow!
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!"
Squidward: I wonder who that could be.
SpongeBob: Ready to go?
"Squidward: No, I'm not ready to go!"
Patrick: He doesn't wanna play with us.
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?"
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No!  Huh?
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No!  No!  What?!
SpongeBob: Ready yet?
"Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!"
SpongeBob: Sure we do.
Squidward: What?  D'oh...!
SpongeBob: Ready?
"Squidward: OUT! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!"
SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.
"Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out.  Hello...?  Ahh, alone at last."
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward?  Squidward!  Squidward? Oh, Squidward!  Squidward!"
"SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!"
"Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone!  What the...?  Locked?! Oh no! Oh... well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time."
"Narrator: 2,000 years later..."
Sponge-Tron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod!
Squidward:  I'll be out of here in no time.
"Sponge-Tron: Greetings, primitive."
Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?
Sponge-Tron: SpongeBob? No!  I am Sponge-Tron.  Welcome to the future!
Squidward: What?
Sponge-Tron: Welcome to the future!
"Squidward: Uh, the future...  Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?"
Sponge-Tron: Everything is chrome in the future!
"Squidward: Wha...?  Oh, my...  Impossible! He's lying!  He's right!"
"SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z."
Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Sponge-Tron: Sure! All 486 of them!
"Squidward:  Future! Future! Future! Future!  Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!"
"Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z:  Jellyfishing!"
"Pat-Tron: Did somebody say, jellyfishing?"
"Sponge-Tron: Hi, Pat-Tron!"
Squidward: J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
"Sponge-Tron: Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left.  Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right."
"Squidward: Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior...  Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past!"
"Squidward:  Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm.  Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet.  Huh?  Huh? What?!  Huh!?  SpongeBob?  Stay back!  Uh, no thanks.  Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now.  Yes, that's my arm.  Oh, that's sweet.  What, is it time for your flea bath now?  Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish.  Well, I'm going away now.  Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!"
"Squidward: What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them!  Give me those loincloths!  I can't believe it.  This oughta make things go a little smoother!  Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this!  It's called jellyfishing.  Ah, finally.  Get me outta here!  Uh-oh."
Time Machine: Loser!
Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all...  ...alone!
Voices: Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone!
"Squidward: I gotta get outta of here!  Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?!  I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Patrick!"
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys."
SpongeBob: Does this mean you wanna go...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Jellyfishing?
Squidward: No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
"SpongeBob and Patrick: You are, Squidward!"
Squidward: I'm going back.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's here!
"SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops."
Patrick: Wow.
"SpongeBob:  Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!"
Patrick: Let me try!
"SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm."
"Patrick: Oh, sorry."
"SpongeBob: You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out."
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob:   Onward... to Squidward's house.
Squidward:  Go away!
"SpongeBob: To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?"
Sandy: They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.
SpongeBob: Who?
"Sandy: My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?"
Sandy: It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?
"SpongeBob:  SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut."
Patrick: What's it saying?
"SpongeBob: It says... It's dark in here. Got anything else, Sandy?"
"Sandy: There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a nice, hot frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!"
"SpongeBob: So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine."
"Sandy: Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure."
"SpongeBob: We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!"
Patrick: What'll we do?
"SpongeBob: They're looking for an invention, right?"
Patrick: Right.
SpongeBob: So let's start inventing!
Patrick: Yeah!
"SpongeBob: It's time to get serious, Patrick."
Patrick: Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.
"SpongeBob: That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented."
"Patrick: Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark."
"SpongeBob: Light bulb, already invented."
"Patrick: SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe."
"SpongeBob: That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented."
Patrick: Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!
"SpongeBob's Reflection:  Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea."
SpongeBob:  Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.
"Sandy: ♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪"
"SpongeBob:  I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here."
Patrick: Who?
SpongeBob: Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!
Patrick: I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Chimp #1: Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade."
Dr. Marmalade: At your service.
Professor Percy: And this is Lord Reginald.
Lord Reginald: Charmed.
Patrick: You guys talk funny. Say more words!
"Professor Percy: We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff."
"SpongeBob: Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!"
Patrick: And I used to be dumb.
Professor Percy: Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?
SpongeBob: My name is SpongeBob.
Patrick: And I am Professor Patrick.
SpongeBob: Professor?
Patrick: Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.
Professor Percy: Where is Miss Cheeks?
SpongeBob: She should be back any moment.
Patrick: I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!
"SpongeBob: Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?"
Patrick: Good idea.
SpongeBob: Well?
"Patrick: Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work."
"SpongeBob: Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!"
Professor Percy: This is where our research money went?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!
"Lord Reginald: An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before."
"Professor Percy: Yes, how do we know this contraption works?"
Dr. Marmalade: Let's see a demonstration.
Patrick: Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.
Lord Reginald: Me?  Are you sure this is safe?
Patrick: As sure as I'm a doctor professor.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think we should test it?"
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: That's not exactly what I had in mind!
"Professor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right?"
"Lord Reginald: Oh I say, this is splendid.  Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this?  Oh marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant."
"SpongeBob: Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick."
"Patrick: Thank you, lowly assistant."
"Lord Reginald: Oh I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!"
SpongeBob: Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.
"Lord Reginald: Now it's tuning my ukulele!  Ouch! I say, was that necessary?  You sir, are impertinent.  Oh, dear."
"Dr. Marmalade: Lord Reginald, are you all right?  Um sorry, was that a yes?"
"Professor Percy: Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?"
Patrick: It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!
SpongeBob: Oh I really wish Sandy were here.
Bus Driver: All aboard!
Sandy: Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?
"Bus Driver: It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg."
Sandy: What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?!
(Patrick laughs)
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?!
Lord Reginald: Ouch.
Patrick: It works! It works!
"Professor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right?"
Lord Reginald: I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.
Professor Percy: We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.
"Dr. Marmalade: Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it."
"SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay."
"Sandy: I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick."
Patrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
Sandy:  Don't push it.
Patrick:  Sorry.
"Professor Percy: We are departing, Dr. Marmalade."
"Dr. Marmalade: My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels.  Good gracious! Can it be?"
Professor Percy: Try it again.
Lord Reginald: Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!
"SpongeBob: Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!"
Sandy: Yeah.
"Professor Percy: Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations."
"Lord Reginald: It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise."
Sandy: I accept.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
"Professor Percy: I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things."
Lord Reginald: Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.
"Dr. Marmalade: Now, now, one miracle at a time."
All Chimps: Goodbye!
"Sandy: Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption."
Patrick: My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob!  Wake up, boy! You're burning me money!"
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?"
"Mr. Krabs: Here, use this!"
Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office.  What's wrong, boy?"
"SpongeBob: Well, I."
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
"SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking."
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work.
"SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish."
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob:  I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles!"
"Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back."
"SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener."
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off.
Patrick:  Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It's all yours.
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
"SpongeBob: All yours, old friend.  Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have."
Patrick: Ol' Reliable?
"Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?"
"SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish."
"Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright."
"SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz."
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I'll give him a week.
Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes.
Patrick: Patrick sad!
"SpongeBob:  I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home!  Brothers and sisters, wait for me!  Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here!  Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go...  ...that way.  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  This is the life.  Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz?  Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are?  Uhh... nice to meet you."
"Sandy: Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!  There he is, Patrick. Say your line!"
"Patrick:  Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one.   Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home.   I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home."
Patrick: I miss you!  Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you!
SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now.
Patrick: No! SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this.  Patrick! What are you doing?"
"Patrick: If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy!  I even picked out this nice jar for you!"
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now!
"Patrick: I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: Patrick! No!
Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy!
"SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters.  Mmm, jelly.  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning.  Greetings, comrades!  Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy!  Ah! Poison sea urchins!  Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches.  Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.  Krabby Patties.  Sandy.  What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up."
"All: Welcome home, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do.
Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
"SpongeBob:  Aye, aye, captain!"
"Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor."
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do.  Ta-da.  Aww.
"Squidward: Okay, that's enough."
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this?
Patrick: Patrick itchy!
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!
"Patchy: Ahoy, mateys! Today I'll be spinning a tale you won't soon forget.  It's called SpongeBob SquarePants Vs. The Patty Gadget. Now, SpongeBob was workin', his eye on the grill, 'til he heard a sharp sound that gave him a chill."
SpongeBob: What's going on? What could it mean?
"Patchy: Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine!  And hiding behind it, who do we see? None other than Squidward and his bad face acne."
Squidward: Hey!
Mr. Krabs: What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?
"Squidward: A miracle, a marvel! It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace!"
"Mr. Krabs: But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?"
Squidward: I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face.
"Mr. Krabs:  I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time."
"Squidward: Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime."
Mr. Krabs: Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?
"Squidward: Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, Get lost!"
"Patchy: The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit. But SpongeBob didn't like it. No, not one bit. Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door."
SpongeBob:  I challenge your gadget! I declare patty war!
"Patchy: With three little words, Krabs started the show. Flag raised in the air, he cried..."
"Mr. Krabs: Ready, set, go!"
"Patchy: Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh so quite clever. SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed.  The crowd was impressed."
Sandy: Wow!
"Patchy: They cheered full of glee! All except Patrick, who had to go pee."
"Patchy: A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam. The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out..."
SpongeBob: I won't be defeated!
"Patchy: He took in some air. SpongeBob swelled his physique. Then dozens of patties filled up his cheeks.  He strained and he sweated. He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill!"
Squidward: Not bad!
Patchy: Yelled out Squidward.
Squidward: A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high!
"Narrator: The gizmo, it shuddered, it clattered, it shook! And as Squidward laughed:"
Squidward: Ha-ha!
Patchy: Sandy said...
Sandy: What a schnook!
Patchy: But SpongeBob cried out...
SpongeBob: I won't lose to that thing!
"Patchy: Then he raised up two spatulas and leapt like a spring. His hands were a blur, the patties went flying. He fried up a hundred without even trying. Squidward was worried, SpongeBob couldn't be beat!"
"Squidward: I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat!"
"Patchy: He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue. Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two! The gadget buckled and sparked, it cracked like a gun. So Squidward took off, yelling..."
Squidward:  Let me know if I've won!
"Patchy: Lightning flew from its maw, it looked ready to burst. But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled..."
"SpongeBob: Foul beast, do your worst!"
"Patchy: The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see! Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster. He proved to that thing that he was its master!  The gadget blew into bits and died with a boom. The blast was so loud, it woke King Neptune!"
King Neptune:  What was that?
"Patchy: It was all over, finished and done. With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won. The crowd yelled, Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud! But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud.  The service was short, tears shed with regret. Squidward, it seemed, was the one most upset."
SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah!
"Patchy: What's that? You thought SpongeBob was buried down there? They just buried the gadget! Ha-ha! This I swear!  Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book. Now I gotta go and polish me hook!"
"Customers: Just go! Oh, no."
"Bubble Bass: Yes, I will have a quad patty, with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt, smoked paprika, and micro greens."
Squidward: Gimme a quad—
Bubble Bass: Hold on. I'm not finished with my order.
"Customers: Aw, come on!"
"Bubble Bass: I would like my patties be-cheesed, but not just any cheese will do. Have you any aged gouda?  And yes, it is pronounced how-uda, not goo-da."
Mr. Krabs:  Just eat the regular Krabby Patty  and stop wasting everybody's time!
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that.  It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual.  The customer is always right, when they have money."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs:  Ketchup waster!  Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise."
Squidward: Your napkin.
Mr. Krabs:  Waster!
SpongeBob: Hmm?  Ow! Mr. Krabs!  You gotta calm down!
Mr. Krabs: Oh!  I'll murder-lize him!
"Larry: Relax, little crab guy."
Mr. Krabs:  Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get...
Larry: That's right. Give in to the healing power of my pecs.
SpongeBob: I feel so secure.
Larry:  All better?
Squidward: What? You let him go? We're all dead!  Ow! The grill's still on!
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break.
Larry: Sounds like someone needs a vacation.
Mr. Krabs: I—I could use some me time.
SpongeBob: And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm...
SpongeBob: Order up!
"Mr. Krabs:  I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?"
"SpongeBob: Psst, psst!"
"Mr. Krabs: That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?"
Larry: Larry's got his own gym to run.
"SpongeBob: Come on, Larry. It'll be fun."
Larry: Larry loves fun! I'm in.
Mr. Krabs: All right! Ah!
"SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?"
Larry: Larry likes it just fine. But do the customers always eat like this?
"SpongeBob: Oh, no. They normally eat like this!"
Larry: Those poor people. Someone needs to whip them into shape.
Squidward: What'll you have?
"Fred: Uh...I'll have a double Krabby Patty, Krabby fries, and uh—whoa!"
Squidward: What else?
"Fred: Uh, uh—a Krabby soda...Uh, uh—a Krabby... My leg!"
Squidward:  Hey!  Can I help you?
"Frank:  Yeah, I'll take a Krabby salad, dressing on the side, and 60 more minutes on this rad treadmill."
Squidward:  Here's your change.
"Larry: Here's your order, sir.  And don't forget your side salad!"
"Frank: Yeah! Push it, push it!"
"Larry: Push it, push it!"
"Octavius Rex:  Okay, okay. I'll push it."
"Larry: Push it, push it!"
"Frank: Yeah, push it!"
"SpongeBob: Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!"
Octavius Rex:  Hooray...
"SpongeBob: Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty."
"Larry: Ah, forget Krabby Patties. Those things are over."
"SpongeBob: But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here."
"Larry: Ooh, not anymore. Now we only serve salads and protein power shakes!"
"SpongeBob: Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste."
Larry: You like?
"SpongeBob: No, Larry. No."
Larry: But it gets you jacked!
SpongeBob: I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.
Larry: Everybody wants to get jacked.
"Frank: Yeah, jacked!"
"SpongeBob: Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the..."
SpongeBob: Larry?
Larry:  Jacked.
"Larry: SpongeBob! Squidward! Let's move it, boys. Get those power shakes out and those heart rates up!"
SpongeBob: Sorry!
Squidward: Whoa!
Bubble Bass:  Oh! Horrible sustenance.
Squidward: Let's get outta here!
SpongeBob: Pardon my reach.
"Squidward: Go on without me!  No, wait, don't."
"SpongeBob: Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym."
Larry:  Feel...the...burn!
"SpongeBob: Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired."
"Squidward: Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place.  And I know just where to start: the power shakes."
SpongeBob: I'm on it!
"Squidward: Wait, wait—what about me?"
SpongeBob:  Butter!  Lard!  Mayonnaise.
"SpongeBob: And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise!  Here you go."
"Larry: I'm loving this oily concoction. It really makes Larry's muscles pop!  Thanks, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Okay, that failed. What now?"
Squidward: We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!
SpongeBob: Gotcha!
"Squidward: Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here."
"Frank: Awesome workout, bro!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now."
"Squidward: Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?"
Customers: Help us!  Hungry!
SpongeBob: What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.
"Harold: We can't go home. There's no Krabby Patties at home. I need my Krabby Patties, man!  You gotta help me!"
Customers: Help us! Help! Help!
"SpongeBob: Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them."
Larry and the gym guys: Huh?
"Larry: SpongeBob, you're ruining Larry's pump sesh."
"SpongeBob: Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!"
"Larry: Get 'em, men!"
SpongeBob: Fire!
Gym Guys: Mmm!
"Frank:  Get over here!  Mmm. Oh, gimme, gimme!"
Squidward: Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Gym Guys: Huh?
"SpongeBob: Give into the flavor, Larry!"
Larry:  Never!
"SpongeBob: He's too fast. We need a distraction.  Here, use this."
"Larry: No, you gotta keep your elbow— Oh! Greasy, fatty, sticky, and gummy! It's delicious! Larry's been a fool. I've spent all my time working on my muscles when I could've been working on these delicious sandwiches.  What's—what's wrong with me?"
Bubble Bass: Now those are some sad pecs.
"SpongeBob:  Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape.  Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers."
Squidward: Somebody let me out of this thing already!
Mr. Krabs:  Home sweet home.  Hmm?
SpongeBob: Order up!
Mr. Krabs:  Everything's just how I left it.
"SpongeBob:  And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Whoa! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that?"
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob?"
"Mr. Krabs: Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie."
"SpongeBob: Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today!"
"Mr. Krabs: Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy?"
SpongeBob:  The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get a hold of yourself, boy."
SpongeBob:
"Mr. Krabs: What is it now, boy?"
"SpongeBob:   Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!"
Mr. Krabs: Then don't blink.
"SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs."
"SpongeBob: Yes, it's working..."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got fifty orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties."
SpongeBob: You want me to go in there?
"SpongeBob: Save me, the darkness!"
"Mr. Krabs: Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?"
SpongeBob: Night light?
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!"
"SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Night light, night light... Oh!  Oh, it's beautiful!  Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?"
"Gale: If I answer Yes, will you leave the store sooner?"
"SpongeBob: Now that I can see...  Woo-hoo! I can sleep!  I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom!  Night light! Night light!  Oh, thank you, thank you!  There, there, there, and there.  I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary.  Now there's not one square inch of dark!"
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: What was that, Gary?"
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me!"
"Patrick: SpongeBob's having a party without me?  Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that."
"SpongeBob: That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!"
Patrick: Oh!
"SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick!  What is that, Gary?  Patrick, what are you doing!?"
Patrick: Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
"SpongeBob: You know what that means?  Sleepover!  Your sleeping bag, sir."
"Patrick: Thank you, my good man."
"SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t..."
Both: The dark!
Squidward:  Burning!
"SpongeBob: The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us..."
Squidward: What are you two whimpering about?
"Squidward: It's me, Squidward, you idiots!"
"Patrick: Hi, Squidward!"
"Squidward: Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?"
"SpongeBob: But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-"
"Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination."
"Patrick: No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark!  Oh, why won't he listen?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?"
"Patrick: Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!"
"SpongeBob: You said it, Pat!"
"Patrick: Quick, SpongeBob! Turn it on!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights!"
Fish #1:  The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time.
"Mermaid Man:  This is what passes for info-tainment these days?  Sweet mother of Neptune's mother! Look, Barnacle Boy! A call to action! To the Invisible Boat Mobile!"
"Patrick: More lights, SpongeBob! More lights!"
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man!?
Patrick: Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob: Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
Mermaid Man: We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you."
"Mermaid Man: Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless there's a real emergency.  And another thing: What the-!?  Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemeses—My mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! At last, I have you! Come get some, fiend!  Come back here, rival!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here!"
"The Moth: Savory light, come to me!"
"SpongeBob: Say, let me help you!  Is that enough light for you?  Well, he's all taken care of."
Mermaid Man: Who?
"SpongeBob: The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon!"
The Moth: See you in another 57 years!
Mermaid Man: No!
Barnacle Boy: I think it's time to go home.
Mermaid Man: Why are we here again?
"SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!"
Mermaid Man: Who are those two hideous creatures of the dark?
"Barnacle Boy:  I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!"
"SpongeBob: We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter."
"Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!"
SpongeBob: Pat! Come ba...
Patrick:  Too much light! Too much light!
"Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!"
"Sandy: Hmm?  Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again."
"Plankton:  I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!"
Sandy: You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick.
Plankton:  Yes.  Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick!
Plankton: One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.
Plankton: Nagging Neptune!  Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!
Plankton: Sweet gashes molasses!
"Karen: Oh, pee-yew! What's that awful stench? You're not boiling your underpants again, are you?"
"Plankton: I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce.  But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus."
"Plankton: Idiot sauce!  I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?"
Karen: I think I'd prefer the boiling underpants.  Let me do it. You always make a mess.
"Plankton: Leave me be, woman!"
Karen: Don't tell me...
Plankton: Oh no.
Squidward: I've got the best taste in town! Duh!
Sandy: I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.
"Sandy: What happened to your head, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Uh, me make Krabby Patties."
"Sandy: Uh, that's mud."
"Sandy: Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?"
Patrick: I don't understand the question.
Sandy: What in Sam Hill?
"Sandy: Hey, don't do that!"
"Sandy: Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero."
Sandy:  Zero as being everyone's collective IQ.
Karen: And that's how the idiot sauce spread throughout Bikini Bottom. I guess you weren't affected because you were protected by your treedome.
Sandy: And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.
Plankton: You not Plankton! Me Plankton!
Karen: We need to snap him out of this. What's the opposite of dim?
Sandy: Bright.
Karen: It's not working! Maybe we can feed him something for brain food. You're smart. What do you eat?
Sandy: Nuts?
"Sandy: Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change?"
"Karen: I usually just yell at him. Get smart, dummy!"
Sandy: Wise up!
"Karen: Be clever, idiot!"
Sandy: Know things!
Karen:  It's no use. Being smart takes work.
Sandy:  That gives me an idea.
"Sandy: Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up, all you morons! Classes are now beginning!"
Sandy: Aww! This isn't working!
Karen: Try jiggling the keys!
"Sandy: Good mornin', students."
Sandy: A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.
French Narrator: One semester later...
Sandy: And don't forget your last homework assignment!
Karen: Looks like we were able to educate the whole town in one semester!
Sandy: Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well.
Karen: Everybody but one.
Plankton:  Yeah!
Mr. Krabs:  Skool iz dum? You misspelled every word.
"Plankton:  Shut up, dweeb!"
"Plankton: Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!"
"Plankton: I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!"
"SpongeBob:  Um, Plankton, can I come out now?"
"Plankton: Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?"
SpongeBob: Yeah.
"SpongeBob: You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn."
Plankton: I'll never learn!
Plankton: Not again!
French Narrator: Ahh. Graduation Day.
"Sandy: This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet."
"SpongeBob: Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas."
Mr. Krabs: Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula!  Yes! That's it!
"SpongeBob: Great! Well, see ya out there."
Plankton: Somethin' smells good!
Mr. Krabs: Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?
"Plankton: It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon.  Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!"
"Mr. Krabs:  No, please! Not that! Anything but that!"
"Plankton: Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!"
"Karen: Congratulations, SpongeBob! You're smart now! It's funny that Mr. Krabs never showed up to get his diploma."
SpongeBob: Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.  Let me have that diploma!
"Patrick: Uh, hey. No running in the halls!"
"Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Plankton."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, your diploma!"
"Mr. Krabs: Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!"
"Plankton: What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!"
"Mr. Krabs: Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!"
Plankton: But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!
"Sandy: Excellent, Mr. Krabs!  Here's your final grade for acting class. A+.  I've really felt the fear."
"Plankton: Wait, what?! Acting class?!  No!"
"Mr. Krabs: You've finally been schooled, drop-out!"
"Karen: Come on, evil genius. Time to start your post-college years."
Squidward:  You people are proof that evolution can go in reverse!
Customers: Shh!
Customers: Ooh! Ahh!
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
"Bubble Bass: Ooh, impressive! That's most impressive!"
"Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, why aren't these walking wallets spending money?"
Squidward:  Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward:  Ow!
"Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent.  Ding!  And talent equals money!"
SpongeBob: I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!
"Mr. Krabs: Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down."
SpongeBob:  Why'd you do that?
"Mr. Krabs: In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook."
"SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure."
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense. You're a born performer.  Ooh!  Here.  You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?
"Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Uh...  Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!"
SpongeBob:  I can't! I've got stage fright!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!"
Mr. Krabs: There he is!  ChefBob!  Me little star!  Break a leg. Break two legs.
Fred:  My leg!
"Mr. Krabs: Shut up, Fred!  Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!"
Customers: Ooh!
Harold Reginald: What?
Fred: That's just wrong!
"Mr. Krabs: Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do?  Huh? Oh!"
"ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?"
Dave: I guess I am.
"ChefBob: Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob!  Your order, please!"
Mr. Krabs:  The little ChefBob is a sensation.
"ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?"
Customers: We are!
ChefBob: Huh?
"ChefBob: Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!"
ChefBob: Ta-da!
Clay:  Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.
"Squidward: Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head."
ChefBob: Huh?
"ChefBob: Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!"
"Squidward: Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line."
"Clay:  Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping!"
SpongeBob: D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
"Jennifer Mille:  Hey, do me! Insult me!"
"ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?"
Jennifer Mille:  That was a good one.
ChefBob:  Huh? Oh!
"SpongeBob: ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers."
Harold (red fish): Me next!  Shoot me a zinger!
"ChefBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that.  I don't speak goober!"
Harold (red fish):  I love it! Guilty as charged!
"Squidward: Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster."
"Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho, ho, ho!  Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, what's this, here?"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, does he?  Fresh cut seaweed.  A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand? What?  A bigger dressing room?"
"ChefBob: In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy."
Mr. Krabs: Blubber Boy?!  No way!
"ChefBob:  What's the matter, Krabs?  You don't like money?"
Mr. Krabs:  What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes.
"SpongeBob: ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?"
ChefBob: Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?
"SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir."
"Squidward: ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!"
"ChefBob:  Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right."
"Squidward: Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal."
"ChefBob: Let me make it up to ya!  Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!"
"Squidward: Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind."
"ChefBob: I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!"
Squidward:  Huh?
"SpongeBob:  Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!"
Squidward:  That's even more insulting.
"ChefBob: Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen!"
Nat Peterson: Ow! Not funny!
Jimmy Gus: He scores!
"Fred: Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!"
ChefBob: Have a drink!
"ChefBob: No, no!"
SpongeBob: En garde!
"Mr. Krabs: Me customers!  Alright, enough of this."
"Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: ChefBob, you are hereby fired!  Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?"
Hand puppet Squidward:  Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!
SpongeBob:  I learned a very valuable lesson today.
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?
"SpongeBob: Well, yeah, that, but  mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer."
SpongeBob: Ow.
"SpongeBob:  What is it, Squidward?"
"Mr. Krabs:  What is it, Mr. Squidward?"
Squidward: It's—it's alive!
"TV Announcer: And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!"
"ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?"
"ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?"
"ChefBob: Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!"
"Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!"
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick! Here I come!"
"Patrick: Nice landing!  Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking."
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
Patrick: Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball.
"SpongeBob: Well, who knows how long it... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!"
"Patrick: There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?"
"SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look, Patrick!"
Patrick: Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
Patrick: That sounds delightful!
"SpongeBob: Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up.  That's right, just bring in here. Careful, careful now. That's right."
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend?"
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley."
Patrick: Something tells me they don't like each other.
"SpongeBob: Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft spots in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's right. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends.  Oh, my goodness! Patrick, oh! Oh, Patrick, please do something!"
"Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now."
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, see you later then."
"SpongeBob: All right, Gary, just so there isn't more upset, I'm gonna ask that you sleep on the guest newspaper tonight, and Mr. Wormsley is going to be sleeping in here with me.  Now, now, Gary, there's no need for protest.  See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are.  Night, Gare."
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob:  Oh, sounds like Patrick is having one of his night fits again. I'll just close the window.   Mr. Wormsley!  Whoa! I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move! Just, uh, read the sports section or something."
SpongeBob: He's in here.  Oh! I can't watch!
Patrick: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: Something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a Mrs. Wormsley.
"SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle."
Patrick: That it is.
SpongeBob: Wait till Gary sees.
Patrick: Yeah! Wait till...
"SpongeBob: See, Gare? Right in here. They're gone asleep."
Patrick: Looks like they still aren't quite used to each other.
"SpongeBob: Well, these things take time."
SpongeBob and Patrick: Duck and cover!
Patrick: This town is getting too rough for me.
"Gary: Meow, meow, meow."
SpongeBob: He's chased her away! Now who will care for her abandoned litter of adorable newborn infants?
"Patrick: Well, maybe you could take care of them."
"SpongeBob: I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset."
Patrick: Ga...who?
"SpongeBob: Nope, you and I are just gonna have to find loving homes for each and every one of these little guys. Right, Patrick?  Patrick?  Don't worry, little guys. Squidward is a really good friend of mine, and he really likes pets."
"Squidward:  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?"
"SpongeBob:  Squidward, I came over with a very special surprise."
Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?
SpongeBob: How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the—baby what?
SpongeBob: Baby worms. See? Aren't they just adorable at that age?
Squidward:
"SpongeBob: So, how many did you want?"
"Mrs. Puff: Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house."
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Mrs. Puff."
Mrs. Puff: It almost was.
SpongeBob: Would you like a baby worm?
Mrs. Puff: A what?
"SpongeBob: Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!"
Mrs. Puff:  I hate Mondays.
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you.  Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some...  Ma'am?  That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?"
Larry: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: Probably not.
Larry: I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns.
SpongeBob: So I see.
"Larry: Well, catch you later."
"SpongeBob: Oh, Larry, wait."
"Larry: No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking."
"SpongeBob: Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms."
Larry: Baby worms?
"SpongeBob: Well, yeah!"
Larry: I'll take them off your hands.
SpongeBob: Really?
"Larry: Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein!"
"SpongeBob: Larry, no!"
"Larry: Dude, nice hustle."
"SpongeBob: Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised.  Hello?"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work!  Hello?"
"SpongeBob:  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?"
"SpongeBob:  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live."
Mr. Krabs: Babies?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Let me see.
SpongeBob: Really?
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies."
"SpongeBob: Well, okay."
"Mr. Krabs:  Hey there, little critters.  Come to..."
"SpongeBob: Oh, he likes you."
"Mr. Krabs:  Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto!  Blech!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, well. At least I still have you guys."
Garbage Fish #1: Hmm...
Garbage Fish #2: What is it?
"Garbage Fish #1: I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species."
"Garbage Fish #2: Dude, those things are worth a fortune."
"Mr. Krabs: Did you say fortune?   $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks."
Female fish: These things are so cute!
"SpongeBob: Enjoy your new home, little guy."
Female fish: Isn't he just adorable?
"SpongeBob: That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad."
SpongeBob: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. I've never been to the old country!
"Larry: What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!"
"Larry: Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted."
Crowd: Awwww!
"Larry: Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!"
Larry: For the price of a lifetime membership!
Crowd: Awww!
Larry: But today everything is free!
Larry's #1 Fan: Shape us and mold us in your image!
"Frankie Billy:  You're the lobster, Larry! The Alpha Lobster!"
"Larry: Well, I don't know if I'll say that!"
"Lloyd-Rich: Oh, I filled out a membership form!"
Nat Peterson: Me too!
Larry: What's in that pink box?
"Nat Peterson: Um, donuts sir?"
"Larry: Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!"
Mr. Krabs: Is it true that everything is free?
"Larry: That's right, sir! For your first visit we-"
"Larry: Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory!"
"Larry: Boy, I've got my work cut out for me."
Larry: The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.
SpongeBob: Oh!
Larry:  Here!
"SpongeBob: Aah! Thanks, Larry!"
"Larry: Uh, what are you doing?"
Mr. Krabs: You said everything was free.
"Larry:  No, no. Your first visit is free."
"Mr. Krabs: So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!"
Larry:  Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.
Larry:  I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
"SpongeBob: Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?"
Larry: Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule.  Always be hydrating.
"SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?"
"Larry: Sure!  What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?"
SpongeBob:  Squishy.
Larry:  What I'm saying is I can make you a man.
SpongeBob: Hooray!
"Larry: I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership."
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Larry: That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!
"SpongeBob: Yes, sir!"
Larry: And remember: always be hydrating!
"SpongeBob: Ok, I will!"
"Larry: That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later."
"SpongeBob: Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers.  Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, Beautiful Angel. That's normal, right?"
"Frank (muscular goldfish): It's Larry, King of the Gym!"
"Larry: Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!"
Larry: Polish this crown for me. Will you?
"Mr. Krabs: Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these...  really heavy... pieces of metal for free!"
Mr. Krabs: Ow! Free!
"SpongeBob: I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things."
French Narrator: Flashback...
French Narrator: End of flashback...
Larry: Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
"Larry: Here we go. Cotton swabs.  Cotton balls.  Here. Try this on for size, Hercules."
SpongeBob: How am I doing?
Larry: Pathetic.
"SpongeBob:  Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!"
"Larry: Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me."
"Larry: First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class."
SpongeBob: I'll be there!
Larry: That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
"Larry: The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle!  Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches!  Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh.  Only now, I'll do it on my back."
Larry: Could you do it without the laugh?
"SpongeBob: I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not."
Larry: Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
SpongeBob: Always be hydrating.
Larry:  Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
Mr. Krabs: Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Larry: Do you have to do that in front of me?
Mr. Krabs: Yes! Yes I do!  Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
Mr. Krabs: Nice potbelly!
Larry: Potbelly?
"Larry: Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy."
Larry:  Oh my Neptune!
SpongeBob: Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
Frankie Billy: My legs!  I'm ok!  Slightly less ok!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
"SpongeBob: Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?"
Squidward: Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
SpongeBob: Larry?
"SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go."
"Larry: With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!"
"Larry: SpongeBob, tell me the truth.  Do I have a potbelly?"
"SpongeBob: No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly."
Larry:  See you in exercise class. I guess.
Mr. Krabs: Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt.
"SpongeBob: Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today."
"SpongeBob: I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back."
SpongeBob:  Walk on your back.
SpongeBob: And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
"SpongeBob: I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker."
"Larry: Oh, what's the use."
"Larry: Oh, who am I kidding!"
"SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?"
"Larry: Yeah.  Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self."
"SpongeBob: I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty..."
"Larry: I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob.  You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die."
SpongeBob: This sounds great.
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!"
Larry: Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
SpongeBob: You mean a br-ug?
Larry: I don't wanna call it that.
"SpongeBob: Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!"
"SpongeBob: Whoa, what happened?"
"Larry: Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!"
"SpongeBob: Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!"
Larry: Don't say br-ug.
SpongeBob:  Br-ug.
"Larry: SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed!  You're a pretty good instructor after all.  Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves."
French Narrator: The very next evening...
"Squidward: Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Oh, what a great day."
Squidward: And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
"Larry: Huh?  What is that smell?  Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!"
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!
Squidward:  What is your problem?
Mr. Krabs: My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
"Squidward: Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?"
"{{L|Mr. Krabs|Tentacles, I mean it!  You get back to mindin' that register!"
Squidward: Minding it for  which customer?
"Mr. Krabs: I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!"
Squidward: SpongeBob's got that covered.
"SpongeBob:  Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking!"
Mr. Krabs: That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
"Squidward: I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up."
"Mr. Krabs: Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!"
"SpongeBob: Already done, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task."
"SpongeBob: Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!"
"Mr. Krabs: Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep--"
SpongeBob: Done and dusted!
"Squidward: Nice working conditions, but, no thanks!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!"
"Squidward: Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes."
"SpongeBob:  Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!
"Squidward: Sorry, all out of polish."
"SpongeBob:  Well, I'm not!"
"Mr. Krabs: Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another."
"Squidward: It doesn't matter what you want me to do, I won't do it!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible."
"SpongeBob:  Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
SpongeBob:  The Yeti Krab?
"Mr. Krabs:  Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge."
"Mr. Krabs: Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You will be eaten!"
SpongeBob:  Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
Squidward: Ludicrous.
"Mr. Krabs: You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or..."
SpongeBob: Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
"Mr. Krabs: Precisely. See ya, boys!"
Squidward: Whatever.
"SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!"
Squidward:  You sure it's not these you're smelling?
"SpongeBob: If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!"
"Squidward: Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!"
"SpongeBob:  Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!"
"Squidward: You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies."
"SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay."
Narrator: Just then... By sheer coincidence...
"Yeti Krab's stomach: Let me out of here, you hairy brute! I can find my own food!"
"SpongeBob:  Good day, sir. Are you Yeti to order?  Oh, Squidward!"
Squidward:  What? What? What? Wha... huh?
SpongeBob: You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
"Squidward:  Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?"
"SpongeBob: Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!"
"Squidward:  Oh, yes I am."
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!"
Squidward:  I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?
"SpongeBob:  Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!"
"Squidward:  Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob:  Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded."
"Squidward: SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!"
"SpongeBob: Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant!"
"Squidward: Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!"
SpongeBob: Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say!
Squidward:  Guess I'm down to the comic section.
SpongeBob: Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!
"Squidward: That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witless, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too!"
SpongeBob:  T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs!
"Squidward:  Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody!"
"Mr. Krabs: I'm back, fellas!"
"Squidward:  Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours."
"Mr. Krabs: Uh, Squidward?"
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
"SpongeBob:  Guys, do you hear that?"
Squidward: You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp?
"SpongeBob: No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me."
"Mr. Krabs: Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idle? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!"
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob:  Done!
Mr. Krabs: Refinish me floors!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Done!
Mr. Krabs: Build me a new safe!
Squidward: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: Consider it done!
"Mr. Krabs: Yeesh, we need some customers in here.  What's gotten into you?"
Patrick: I don't know.  What's happening to me?
"SpongeBob: I think I can explain.  Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, he needs one, eh?  Methinks a paying customer's in our midst.  Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?"
Patrick:  Give me!
"Mr. Krabs: Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?"
"Patrick: Oh, yeah, I can pay for it."
Mr. Krabs: Good boy.
Narrator: Ten seconds later...
"Mr. Krabs: My good man, how you doing?  Excellent. Now, let's get down to business."
Patrick: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: It's your bill.
Patrick: I don't have any money.
Mr. Krabs: What? I thought you said you could pay for it!
"Patrick:  Oh, I'm payin' for it all right."
Mr. Krabs:  Non-paying customer!
Patrick:  Huh?
"Mr. Krabs:  You're gonna pay, one way or another.  All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine.  I'll be back in a while to check up on you.  Bottom-feeding..."
"Patrick: No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la.  Work, work, work, work."
"Mr. Krabs:  So, Patrick, how are you...?  What in blazes did you do?"
Patrick:  I accidentally tried the hand soap.  It doesn't taste as good as it smells.
Mr. Krabs: See these ice cube trays?  I want you to put 'em in that bucket.
Patrick: How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs: Figure it out!
Patrick: Uh... I have to be very gentle.
Mr. Krabs: What the...? What are you doing?
"Patrick:  Almost done, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: You've destroyed me refrigerator.  You've destroyed many of the things I love.  I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up.  All you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so.  See?"
Patrick: Yup.
"Mr. Krabs: Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again!"
"Patrick: Hurry, hurry, hurry!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe."
"SpongeBob: Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs.  Patrick, what's up, buddy?"
"Patrick:  I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down."
SpongeBob:  That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch.
"Patrick: SpongeBob, you're a genius!  Oh, no, there's one left."
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, that's not a...  trash bag."
Patrick:  NO! Why won't you go down?!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick?"
Patrick:  Can I eat now?
Squidward: Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!
"SpongeBob:  Good morning, Squidward!"
"Squidward:  Ignoring, ignoring! La la dum. La la dee. La la doo.  Chewing gum!? That's disgusting!  Oh, c'mon!  People who litter really bug me!  Litterbugs.  Litterbugs!"
Officer John:  Litter!  Aha!
Squidward:  Bugs... litter... litter... bugs.
"Officer John: Hey, you! Did you throw this gum away?"
"Squidward: Yes I did, and I like to complain!"
Officer John: Ah... So you admit that you are a litterbug?
"Squidward: I do... What? No! No no, I just stepped in it!"
"Officer John: Oh, you sure did, buddy. You disgust me...  Maybe this will teach you not to treat the world as your own personal trash can!"
Squidward: Bikini Bottom P.D. Ticket for littering. Penalty: Community service?!
"Squidward: Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug!  Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!"
"Thug Fish: Here, you can have mine."
Squidward:  Can things get any worse?
Squilliam: Of course they can!
Squidward: Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!
Squilliam: Stuck doing community service eh? Court ordered?
"Squidward: No! I... um... I'm... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause."
"Squilliam: Oooh! Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom, they'll build a statue of you! Oh, wait! They've already built one... of me!  I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week."
"Mable Monica: Bless you, Squilliam Fancyson! Bless you!"
Squidward:  Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!
Squilliam: Ooh! Let me help you out.  There! That should get you started. Tah-tah!
"Squidward: Squilliam thinks he's sooo amazing!  Phew!  Hmmm, I've gotta find some place to dump this litter.  Oh oh oh! Perfect!  Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this..."
Taylor: Whoops!
Mabel: Oh is it trash day? I thought it was Tuesday!
Squidward: What? No!
"Mabel:  Hey everybody, it's trash day!"
Other Fish: Trash day?!
Squidward: Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man!  Help.
SpongeBob: I'll help you Squidward!
Squidward: Why are you in a trash bag?
"SpongeBob: I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty.  Tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy.  I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!"
Squidward: No thank you! I'll do it myself.
SpongeBob: Please let me help!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Please?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Pretty please?
Squidward: No way!
SpongeBob: Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?
"Squidward:  Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!"
"Taylor: That's him, mommy! That's the man who stole my wagon! Beat him to a pulp!"
Taylor's mother: Hmmm!
"SpongeBob: Hi, lady!"
SpongeBob: Can I help you now?
Squidward: Alright! Fine! You can help me.
"SpongeBob:  Yay!  Thank you, Squidward."
Squidward: Well... you gonna help me!?
"SpongeBob: First, close your eyes!"
Squidward: Why?
SpongeBob: C'mon!
Squidward: Fine!  Now what?
SpongeBob: No peeking.
Squidward: Oh brother.
SpongeBob: Okay! You can open your eyes now!
Squidward: Oh this is so stuuuuuu...  ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?
SpongeBob:  I put it in...
"Squidward: Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks, SpongeBob. I hate you a little less now."
"SpongeBob: Squidward, that... that's a beautiful thing to say!"
"Squidward: Well, I don't know how you did it, but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time!  My house!"
Officer John: Is this yours?
Squidward: Yes.
"Officer John:  Tch-tch-tch, some people never learn."
"SpongeBob: I am angry? Squidward, why are you angry?"
Squidward:  SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: What's this?
SpongeBob: Your garbage.
Squidward: Where's my house?
SpongeBob: On top of your garbage.  The dump was closed.  So I bought it here.
Squidward:  How?
SpongeBob: Like this.  Do you wanna try?
"Squidward: Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth, this is the least annoying."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward..."
Squidward: Wait! Wait! Zip it! I have an idea!  Here stand in this.  See ya sucker!
Officer John: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
Squidward: Neptune no!
"Officer John:  Uh-huh. Oh you got your kicks out of putting trash in other people's bins, eh?"
Squidward: They were gonna build a statue of me!
"SpongeBob: Oh, a statue, eh?  Hey, Squidward! Look!"
Squidward: What is that?!
SpongeBob: Your very own statue!
Squidward:  Really?!  Garbage. I'm made of garbage.
SpongeBob: You sure are!
"Squilliam:  Great job, SpongeBob, you even captured his smell. The scent of failure.  My glorious statue!"
Officer John: This is your statue?
Squilliam: It was.
"Squidward: Ha! Thanks, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, I'm bored."
Patrick: Hmmm... Interesting. Me too! Let's go look for something to do in Old Man Squidward's shed!
SpongeBob: Old Man Squidward's shed?!
Patrick:  Yyyeeeeeep!
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Ooohhh!  What's that?!
Patrick: What is it?
"SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick."
Squidward: Ahh. La-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo!
SpongeBob and Patrick:
SpongeBob: It's Old Man Squidward!
Patrick: Hide!
Squidward:  Where's my trowel?
Patrick:  SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob:  Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick: Is this a trowel?
"SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick!"
"Squidward: Oh, here it is."
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"SpongeBob: Don't hurt us, Squidward!"
Patrick: We're bored!
SpongeBob: We just wanted to play with your...  ...whatever this thing is.
Squidward: No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You morons would probably...  You want to play with my lawnmower?
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Squidward: Hmmm...
"SpongeBob:  Thanks for letting us mow your lawn, Squidward!  Ahhh! My patty flipping hand!"
Squidward:  Knock yourselves out!
"The Flying Dutchman: Excuse me, Davy, I've got my first blind date in 400 years, and I've got to look good.  It's a little torn. Of course this was the shirt I was buried in. Ahhh, memories!  Bleah!  Okay, that one's a bit ripe. Stained. Too itchy! Hey, there she is! I've been saving this beauty for a special occasion!  Sssss! Looking good!  Who dares--  Who--  --disturb--  --The Flying--  --Dutchman?!  My beard! Hey!  Who dares disturb The Flying Dutchman?!"
SpongeBob:  You're not The Flying Dutchman!
"Patrick: Yeah, The Flying Dutchman has a beard!"
"The Flying Dutchman: I don't look like The Flying Dutchman, because...  You morons cut off my beard!"
SpongeBob:  Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger!
The Flying Dutchman: I don't want to look younger! I hate youth! I'll probably get pimples again.
Patrick: Your beard will just grow back.
The Flying Dutchman: You know nothing about me facial hair. It'll take a thousand years for my beard to grow back!
"SpongeBob:  I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts."
"The Flying Dutchman: Well, now's the time you've learned. Until my beard grows back, I'm going to turn you two fools into ghosts. Prepare to be ghostified!"
Patrick: Ghostified? That's not even a real word.
"The Flying Dutchman:  Okay, you're having too much fun. ."
Patrick:  We're mermaids!
The Flying Dutchman: You're ghosts!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
SpongeBob:  We're ghosts!  Yaayyy!
The Flying Dutchman: This isn't really working out the way I imagined.
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh! Squuiiidwaaarrrd!
SpongeBob: It's SpongeBob.
Patrick: And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts!  Ooohhhh!
"SpongeBob: We're going to haunt you! Foreeever!  Oooooohhh—!  Well, that killed the mood."
Squidward: I knew I shouldn't have lent them my lawnmower.
"SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. Being a ghost can sure tire ya out!"
"Patrick: Good night, ghost buddy!"
"SpongeBob:  That's odd. However shall I get in?  That's handy!  I am beat! Well, I don't have to take the stairs!  Ah. ."
"SpongeBob:  Hey, Patrick. I didn't sleep so good last night."
Patrick: I didn't sleep at all. I can see through my eyelids.  My eyelids!
SpongeBob:  I'm late for work!
Patrick:  My eyelids...
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'm here!"
Harold:  Ahh! Mermaid!
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're late! Why are you bright green, and what happened to your legs?"
"Squidward: He's a ghost, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: A ghost, eh? Can you still cook Krabby Patties?"
"SpongeBob: Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!
"SpongeBob: Aye, aye, old living employeer!"
Mr. Krabs: Ewww.
"SpongeBob:  La la la la!  I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!"
Patrick: I don't either. I can't even eat anything! Food just goes right through me!
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Bleah! / Yuck!
Patrick: Maybe the weird hairless man will change us back?
SpongeBob: Yeah! Let's go see the Flying Dutchman!
"The Flying Dutchman: Well, at least I still have my personality."
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Change us back! / Change us back! / We don't like being ghosts! / I don't want to be a ghost!  Change us back! / Change us back! Change us back! / We don't like to be a lie again!
"SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Dutchman, we can't take it! Constantly moaning and groaning!"
Patrick: Invisible to the world!
SpongeBob:  Living without a soul!
Patrick:  It's miserable!
SpongeBob:  How could anyone live like this?!
"The Flying Dutchman: Hmm, I guess you feel my pain. Well, I'll lift the curse from ya."
SpongeBob: Hey! We're still ghosts!
"The Flying Dutchman: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The curse will wear off when my beard grows back."
SpongeBob: But we want to be normal now!
"The Flying Dutchman: Well, I want to be on my date now! But, you knuckleheads loused that up, too!"
"SpongeBob: We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?"
Patrick: And you can't go on your date because you're ugly?
Both: Makeover!
"The Flying Dutchman: Thanks, fellas! I love the new beard. Well, I'm off on my date. Don't wait up."
Patrick: I don't get it...
Narrator: Several months later...
"SpongeBob: Well, here we are several months later! I wonder how the Flying Dutchman's doing on his date!"
The Flying Dutchman: I can't do it!  She wants to marry me! I ain't the marrying type!  Aaaahhh!

"Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe."
"Mr. Krabs: Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!"
"SpongeBob:  Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!"
Squidward:  What's all the yelling about?
Mr. Krabs: Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Plankton: Can I have the secret formula?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Plankton: Okay.
Mr. Krabs:  But he was persistent!
Plankton:  Pretty please?
Mr. Krabs: Uh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!
Squidward:  Fascinating.
"Mr. Krabs: But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula."
Robot:  What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
"SpongeBob: Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
"SpongeBob: With pleasure, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs:  I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?"
"Robot: Yes, please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits."
Mr. Krabs:  You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
"Robot: No, thank you.  Will this cover it?"
"Mr. Krabs: Uh, sure.  Here you go."
Robot:  Good day.
"Mr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good."
Plankton: AHA!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
"Plankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!"
Mr. Krabs: Or what?
Plankton: ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move."
"Plankton: Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Mr. Krabs:  And now for the chaser.
"Plankton: You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands."
Karen: So? Tell me what happened.
Plankton: I don't want to talk about it.
Karen: Talking will make you feel better.
Plankton: Leave me alone.
"Karen: That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner..."
"Plankton: And she's off, ladies and gentlemen."
Karen: You have to do everything yourself...
"Karen: ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this...  and like this...  and more recently, like this."
Plankton:  I'm a failure!
Karen: It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...
Plankton: Henchmen?
"Karen: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say."
"Plankton: I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?"
"Plankton: I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me."
"Karen: Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting.  Sorry."
"Plankton: That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  THEY'RE HERE! Welcome, brethren!"
"Clem:  Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!"
All: Yee-haw!
Plankton: I've been away from home longer than I thought.
"Clem:  Well, howdy, cousin!"
Plankton: Uh...
"Clem: It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... ... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior..."
"Plankton: Alright! I get it! ...I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen."
"Clem:  Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon."
Karen: Sheldon?!
"Plankton:  Yes, that's my first name."
Karen: Sheldon?
Plankton:  Will you please-!
Karen:  Sorry!
"Plankton: All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name."
"Karen:  Okay, okay. I'm done. No more."
"Plankton: Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  AHA!  Okay, that's enough!"
Karen:  Sheldon! Ha Ha!
Plankton: Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?
Family Member 1: But what's in it for us?
"Plankton: Well, what do you want?"
Family Member 2: Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo?
Family Member 3: And another boot to match this'n?
Family Member 4:  And some more memory for my laptop!
Clem: And what about root beer?
All: Root beer!?!?!
"Plankton: Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton!"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for..."
"Plankton:  Attention, Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking."
Mr. Krabs: What?!
Plankton:  I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, you and what army, bug?"
"Plankton: What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: You planted grass?
Plankton: Grass?!?
"Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton."
"Plankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination."
"Plankton: Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left..."
"Mr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!"
"Plankton: Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!"
Family:  Ahem.
"Plankton:  Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family."
"Mr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula."
Plankton: Begging won't help.
"Mr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes."
Plankton: Eye.
Mr. Krabs: Eye.
"Plankton: I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good!  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!"
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!
Plankton:  ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
Mr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!
Plankton:  ...A cup of love...!
Mr. Krabs: Don't do it!
Plankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!
Mr. Krabs: ...I warned ya.
Plankton:
Mr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?
"Clem: Well, I can't read!"
Mr. Krabs: Get out of here!
"SpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?"
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?"
"Mr. Krabs: Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out."
"Squidward: Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress."
"Mr. Krabs:  Curse you, Squidwaaaaaaaaard!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Jellyfishing. I can't wait! Can you, Patrick?  Patrick? Patrick?"
Patrick: Did you say something?
"SpongeBob: Uh, I said...  Ow!"
Patrick: I'm not sure how to respond to that.
SpongeBob:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
"Barnacle Boy:  Hey! We're stuck here, remember?"
Mermaid Man: Why is that?
Barnacle Boy: Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left. See?
"SpongeBob: Hey, heroes! Is there anything we can do?  That's a heavy piece of nothing...  So, is that it?"
"Barnacle Boy: Yes. Uh, thank you, boys. We don't usually do this, but in term for pushing the invisiboat up all those hills, there's something I'd like you to see. But you must promise to not touch anything."
SpongeBob and Patrick: Okay!  Wow!
"SpongeBob: Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582! Man Ray's power glove!"
Patrick: Ooh! A pair of binoculars.
"Mermaid Man: Yes, boys, this is our locker of memories. It contains... Uh... I can't remember."
Barnacle Boy:  It contains all the memorabilia up from our super-human adventures.
"Patrick: Wow. Hey, SpongeBob, check it out!"
SpongeBob: The Dirty Bubble's bubble wand!
Barnacle Boy: Correct!
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"Barnacle Boy:  Scared, boys?"
SpongeBob and Patrick&#160;: Mmm-hmm.
"Barnacle Boy: Well, don't be."
"Mermaid Man: And as long as no one touches anything, there's nothing here to be scared of."
SpongeBob&#160;: Understood.
Barnacle Boy: And this is our time machine. This device allows us to transport into the future or past at a date or destination of our choosing.
SpongeBob and Patrick&#160;: Ooh!
"Barnacle Boy: Unfortunately, the consequences of altering the order of history are so dangerous, we've chosen it to leave it alone, so you mustn’t touch..."
"Patrick&#160;:  Hey, this snack machine took my quarter! I want my crunchy munchities!"
Barnacle Boy: No!
Patrick&#160;: Stupid box!  You really gotta get that thing fixed.
Barnacle Boy: You fool! You realize what you've done?!
"Patrick:  Well, I lost a quarter."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Mermaid Man, and Barnacle Boy:"
"SpongeBob: Oh, where are we?  It can't be! Bikini Bottom has at least 39 people living here!"
"Barnacle Boy: Maybe as you knew it, but this is a different Bikini Bottom of another time. Maybe if you've hadn't touched the time machine like we told you, Patrick, we wouldn't be in this mess! Hopefully, we hadn't changed anything with our presence."
.
SpongeBob: Oh! Everything looks so old-fashioned.
"Man Ray:  I'm ready to rule the world and its riches! With this weapon, nothing can stop me!"
Young Mermaid Man: That's what you think.
Man Ray:  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?!
"Young Mermaid Man: Sorry, Man Ray. But my stalwart companion Barnacle Boy and I beg to differ with you."
"Young Barnacle Boy: You've tangled with the wrong end of the fishhook of justice, Man Ray."
Young Mermaid Man: Now prepare for a heaping helping of quick drying tartar sauce.
"Mermaid Man: Wow, our bodies were so tight."
Barnacle Boy: What went wrong?
"Young Barnacle Boy:  Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man, what happened to the tartar sauce?"
Patrick:  Good thing that was around. I was starving.
Young Mermaid Man: Curious. Could I have forgotten to refill it?
Man Ray:
Patrick: This is creeping me out!
"SpongeBob 1: Patrick, what about Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?"
Patrick: I don't got time for that!
"Mermaid Man: Where are you going, boys?"
Patrick:  I just want to go home!
Barnacle Boy: When are we gonna have those two re-classified as villains?
"Mermaid Man: They left us here! What are we going to do? Eh, I'm sure it'll all work out."
"Young Mermaid Man: Don't worry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are always here to help the elderly. There's something familiar about these two, Barnacle Boy. I just can't put my flipper on it."
"Young Barnacle Boy: Hey, neat hat!"
"Barnacle Boy: Thanks, I... uh..."
Young Mermaid Man: Let’s get these poor defenseless seniors out of harm's way.
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"Patrick: Well, that's more like it. Back in good old present day Bikini Bottom."
"SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time. Hello, fellow citizen.  Hello, Squilliam."
Squilliam: Man Ray is great.
SpongeBob: Yeah.  Must be taking care of his community service obligations.
Patrick:  That'll teach him to jaywalk.
"SpongeBob: Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city?"
"Patrick: Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the clatter of prison chains."
"SpongeBob: I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?"
Patrick: No. But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard!  It's missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!
"SpongeBob: Even worse than that, Patrick. The police got new uniforms!"
"Patrick: Oh, no! What did they do with those old ones?!"
"SpongeBob: And yikes! What happened to the Krusty Krab?!  The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?"
Patrick: I’m all out of Man Ray dollars?
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick. It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past. And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler. Oh, we got to do something."
Patrick: But what?
SpongeBob: What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis. See if I still have a job!
"Man Ray: Hey, you’re not eating fast enough!"
"SpongeBob: Excuse me, Squidw..."
Barnacle Boy: Yes?
SpongeBob: Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here?
Barnacle Boy: Just getting stuck in a wasted life.
Mermaid Man:  Order up!
"SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! He's wearing a hairnet!  What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?"
"Mermaid Man: I lost the desire and the physique to fight long ago, kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you're my age."
"SpongeBob: What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight."
"Mermaid Man: You got spaghetti for brains, kid? We are the younger ones. The older ones...  Bless their souls... have been immortalized in this very restaurant."
SpongeBob: I am so sorry for your loss of... yourself.
"Barnacle Boy: I hate to break up the memorial service, but we're out of tartar sauce out here."
"Mermaid Man: Tartar sauce?! The topping that destroyed life as we knew it! If only my tartar sauce attack hadn't failed that day, we wouldn't be living in this wasteland! We're already out?"
Patrick: Yep. Chewy bits...
"Mermaid Man: I knew I recognize you from somewhere, you were there. And you ate that tartar sauce on that day! Do you realize what you’ve done?!"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Mermaid Man. We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help, of course."
"Mermaid Man: I'm not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had me by the neck! Oh, e-evil!"
SpongeBob: Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?
"Mermaid Man&#160;: Barnacles, no! It means he put this electro-collar on me that won't allow me to leave the restaurant!"
SpongeBob: Oh. Let's get the nasty thing off of you.
Mermaid Man: Haven't you two idiots done enough damage?
"SpongeBob: I can't get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?"
Mermaid Man: Keep away from me!
SpongeBob:  Ta-daaa! You're free! Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?
"Mermaid Man: I suppose you’ve proven your medal, kid. But I'll have my eye on you two. Now let's pop that Dirty Bubble!"
"SpongeBob: Actually, we're fighting Man Ray."
"Mermaid Man: Oh. Well, in that case, let the lighthouse of justice shine on Ray Man!"
"SpongeBob 1: Okay, I suppose that's close enough. Back to the past, gents, just stop you from eating the tartar sauce again for the first time. Hmm."
"The First SpongeBob, Patrick, Mermaid Man, and Barnacle Boy:"
Man Ray:  I am ready to rule the world and its riches!
"Young Mermaid Man: Not so fast, Man Ray!"
Young Barnacle Boy: We've got a little surprise for you.
Second Old Mermaid Man:  Keep your tongue out of the tartar sauce!
Mermaid Man: Impostors!
"Second Old Mermaid Man: Who are you calling impostor, impostor? I must prevent our tartar sauce from being eaten by that fool!"
Mermaid Man: If I want to get near my tartar sauce I gotta to go through me first!
Second Old Mermaid Man: I'm gonna make me eat those words!
Mermaid Man: Bring it.  Take this!  I’ll never let you win.
"Second Old Mermaid Man: Oh, yes, I will."
"Young Mermaid Man: What do you make of this, Barnacle Boy?"
"Young Barnacle Boy: Tangled timeline, Mermaid Man. I-"
Man Ray:  You old coots provided me the perfect distraction. Now prepare to be disappeared!
"Young Mermaid Man: Sounds good on paper, you purveyor of pure evil, but, fortunately, we all know what happens to paper underwater. Barnacle Boy, the tartar sauce."
Patrick 2: Wow! I've never eaten that much tartar sauce.
"Patrick 1: Yes, you have."
"Patrick 2: Well, it sure ain't sittin' right."
"Man Ray:  Foolish mools. Once again, your bufoonery has given me victory!  Oh, I'm going to savor this. It's not every day I get to defeat Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy three times over!"
"SpongeBob 2:  Patrick, don’t eat the tartar sauce!"
"Man Ray: You’re too late! Your fat friend beat you to it. Now, prepare to taste laser!  So how..."
SpongeBob 4:  I told you we had to go back farther!
Man Ray: Uh...
"Third Mermaid Man: Up, up, and away!"
"SpongeBob 5:  Now, Patrick!"
Man Ray: I can't get my head around this. Where are they all coming from?  Another machine?
Second Man Ray:  I took care of your blasted time machine!
Man Ray: Uh! I got to sit down and think this through.
Young Mermaid Man:  Gotta! You've got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome.
"Man Ray: I'm sorry, did you say something? I'm still trying to comprehend what just happened here."
"Young Mermaid Man: It's pretty simple, really. You were defeated by a convoy of continuum-cruising crime stoppers. Thank you, SpongeBob and Patrick."
Four SpongeBobs and Two Patricks: You're welcome!
"SpongeBob 6 and Patrick 6&#160;:  Oh, hi there! Hello! Hello! Hello!"
One Other SpongeBob: We just wanted to come back and revisit the day that evil was defeated forever.
"SpongeBob 7:  Hey, how you doing?"
Seventh Patrick: We’re here.
"Eighth and Ninth SpongeBobs and Patricks:  Oh, hi there! How you doing?"
Tenth SpongeBob and Patrick: Hello! Hello!
Last SpongeBob and Patrick:  Oh hi there!  Hello! Hello!
Karen: What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?
"Plankton: You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples!"
"Karen: New and original, my exhaust fan."
"Plankton: Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!"
Karen: You mean the smell?   Smell.
"Plankton: No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!"
"Nat: Hey, what did he just say it was?"
Plankton: I just said they're free!
Nat: Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case...  So glad I actually left my house today.
"Plankton: That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business."
Sally: What is it?
"Shubie: Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!"
"Sally: Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!"
Plankton: Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger.
"Nat: Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and...  get him."
Patrick: Free samples.  Yum!
"Frank: Hey, you!, I know you're in there!"
Plankton: It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
"Karen: If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant."
"Plankton: Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!"
Harold: Free Krabby Patties?!
"Nat: Hey, what's all the hubble?"
"Nazz: Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!"
Plankton: That's it.
"Frank: Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?"
"Plankton:  Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton."
"Lifeguard: Oh, okay."
"Plankton: Krabby Patties, anyone?"
"SpongeBob:  I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly."
Nat: You!
Frank: You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Over here boy.
SpongeBob: What is going on out there?
Mr. Krabs: The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  Because the Krabby Patty is terrible.  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?
"SpongeBob: I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?"
Mr. Krabs: Fine.  How about that?  I'm ruined!
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures."
Mr. Krabs: I'm all ears.
SpongeBob: We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr-
"Mr. Krabs: Don't you say it, boy!"
"SpongeBob: It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time."
Mr. Krabs: Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free.
SpongeBob: But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
Mr. Krabs: I don't remember saying anything like that.
SpongeBob: I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: No!
"SpongeBob: It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties!"
"Mr. Krabs: Whew, uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed!"
Plankton: I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today!
"SpongeBob: Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope."
"Shubie: Hey look, Billy, a calliope."
"SpongeBob: Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed."
Squidward: I can't feel my legs.
"SpongeBob: Here let me help you, Squidward."
"Baby Billy: Look, mama, a monkey!  Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!"
Squidward: I quit!
"SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!"
"Plankton: Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!"
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this."
"Mr. Krabs: Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like."
SpongeBob: New... Different...  That's it!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room."
Narrator: Five minutes later.
"SpongeBob: Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!"
Nazz: You can't be serious.
"Frank: I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something."
Nazz: No! Wait!
"Nat: Let him go, it's too late."
SpongeBob: All new free Krabby Patties!
"Frank: Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose.  Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay!"
Nazz: Did he just say it was good?
Frank: Woohoo!
"Nat: Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!"
Henry-Bart: I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy?
"Frank: Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yum!  Hey, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more!"
Nat and Nazz: Now that's what I'm talking about!
Nat: Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties!
"Plankton: Don't worry, Karen, I'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?!"
SpongeBob: It's working!
"Plankton: No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh."
"SpongeBob: We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!"
"Mr. Krabs: Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here."
"SpongeBob: Oh, money angels, can I make one?"
"Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?"
SpongeBob: Hear what?
Mr. Krabs: Good point.
"SpongeBob: So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So..."
Squidward: SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob: So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in."
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: They weren't overcooked at all!
"Squidward: SpongeBob, look!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?"
Mr. Krabs: Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
"SpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request. Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born."
Squidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?!
SpongeBob:  Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward: Where are all the new hotel employees?
"Mr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
"Dave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles."
"Mr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service."
"Dave:  Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch."
"Squidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro."
"Mr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk."
"Patrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please."
"Squidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service."
"Patrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?"
"Squidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?"
"Patrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!"
Squidward:  Gimme that! Now sign the register.
Patrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!
"Squidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name."
"Patrick: Oh, okay.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!"
Squidward: Close enough. Here's your room key.
Patrick: I'll need some help with my bags.
Squidward: How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
Patrick: This is a hotel?
Squidward:  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?"
Squidward: Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
Patrick: What about my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: And bring him a Krabby Patty.
"Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty."
"Squidward: Oh, Mr Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
"Squidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick."
Mr. Krabs:  This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.
"Squidward: What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?"
Patrick: I don't tell you how to live your life!
"Squidward: Well, here's your room."
Patrick: Wow.
Squidward: Enjoy your stay.
"Patrick: Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from."
"SpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock."
"Patrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man."
"SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick!"
"Patrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!"
Squidward: What now?!
Patrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
Squidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
Patrick: Peel it.
Squidward:  Happy?
SpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.
Patrick: Could you do one more thing for me?
Squidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
"Patrick: Good idea, Squidward!"
"SpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir?"
Patrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
"SpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir!"
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
Squidward: What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
"Mr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it."
"SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward!"
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!"
"Mr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!"
"Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs..."
"Mr. Krabs: Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there."
Squidward:  A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
"Patrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean."
Squidward: That's it! I've had enough!
"Patrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!"
Squidward: Not anymore. I quit.
Mr. Krabs: Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
"Squidward: One room, please. On the top floor."
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing?
Squidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.
Mr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room!
Squidward: I've got cash.
Mr. Krabs: Oh... here's your room key.
"Squidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room."
"SpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir."
Squidward:  And you can carry me to my room.
Mr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
"Squidward: The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee."
"SpongeBob: Your room, sir."
"Squidward: And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair."
Mr. Krabs:  You've got to be kidding me!
Squidward: And I want it here in five seconds.
"SpongeBob: Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it."
"Squidward: Oh, I'm not going to eat this. You are."
Mr. Krabs: What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
"SpongeBob: Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair."
"Mr. Krabs:  Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese."
Patrick:  Hooray!
"Mr. Krabs:  What is it, Squidward?"
Squidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
Mr. Krabs:  Here's your homemade cookies.
Squidward:  These don't taste anything like mom used to make!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em?"
Squidward: How should I know?! Ask my mother!
Mrs. Tentacles:  Hello?
Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: No good, Mr. Krabs."
"Mrs. Tentacles: Allow me, boy."
Mr. Krabs: Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
SpongeBob: There's room for you to sit up front!
"Mrs. Tentacles: Let's go bake some cookies, boys."
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs:  Well?
Squidward: I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
Mr. Krabs: So you're all taken care of?
"Squidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice."
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.  Perfect!
Mr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started!
Squidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics.
"Mr. Krabs: Let's get out of here, SpongeBob!"
"Squidward: Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming."
Mr. Krabs: The pool's out back!
"Squidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim.  Come on in, the water's fine."
Mr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
"Squidward: Nope, that's it."
Mr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
"Squidward: No, I'm good."
"SpongeBob: Me, too."
"Patrick: Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy!  Cannonball!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start."
Patrick: That was a hotel?
"Nurse: Your bill, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: $15,000?!"
"Squidward: You're not going to have a heart attack, are you?"
Mr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!
Patrick: This is a hospital?
"Mr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!"
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray!
"Squidward:  Oh, boy."
Fred: You know that child we were planning on having?
Fred and his wife: Let's forget it.
"Karen: SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away."
"SpongeBob: Aw, thanks,  and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work."
Karen: They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?
SpongeBob:  I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
Karen: So what do I need to do for them?
"SpongeBob: Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh!  Hm!  Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze.  Whoa-ow-ow-ow!}"
"Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything?  What do you call this gizmo you made anyway?"
Plankton:  The Takeover-er-er.
Mr. Krabs:  That's just stupid.
SpongeBob:  Morning.
Plankton: Morning…
Mr. Krabs: And don't forget your rube goldfish device!  There we go.
"Plankton: Honey, I'm home.  What's this stupid thing?"
"Karen: Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now.  Oh, my!"
"Plankton: Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh?  Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up!"
Plankton: This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys.  Alley-oop!
"Plankton: Too small, too small!  Huh?"
"Plankton:  Hey, why are you idiots so short?  You afraid of me? You gonna cry?"
"Plankton: Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see?  Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?"
"Sea chimp king: Um, I am the king."
"Plankton: Yeah? Well, now I'm the king!"
"Sea chimp king: Wow!  Thank you, sir! I mean, sire.  I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!"
"Plankton: Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart!  That's why!  Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall!"
"Plankton: That's right, bring me all your valuables.  What are those? Dentures? Hand them over.  Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff!  I'm tired of walking. Carry me!"
Sea chimp child: Father!
"Plankton:  Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea!  Hi-yah!  Okay, that's enough. I'm bored."
"Plankton: Yeah!  I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you.  Ow!  Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go.  Hi-yah!"
"Plankton: Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world!  I rule you, I rule you,  and I...rule...you..."
"Plankton: Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king,  I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down.  I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down!  Guys? My people? Loyal subjects?  Buddies?"
"Sea chimp king: Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice!"
Plankton: Sacrifice?
Sea chimps:
Plankton: Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent.  Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!
Plankton:  Hey! Whoa!  Yuck! Time to un-shrink!  Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!
Sea chimp king: Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.
Sea chimps: Aww!
"Plankton: What do you mean, aww? Don't aww!"
Patrick: Ow!  That hurt!  Now that snack's got a bite.
"Sea chimp king: Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice."
"Plankton: Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!"
Plankton: Huh? How did you get over there?  Ahh!
"Sea chimp king:  Hey, you're welcome!"
"Plankton: Hey, dumbbell!  Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me!  It stretches. Go!  You morons should cushion my fall nicely."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time."
Patrick: I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing!
SpongeBob: I hear 'em in there.
"Sea chimp king:  Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?"
"Plankton:  No, don't touch that!"
Patrick: Whoa-oh-oh-oh!  I take it back. They weren't that delicious.
"Sea chimp king: Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here."
Plankton:  Partially digested antennae.
"SpongeBob: Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner."
"Sea chimp king: Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live."
Karen:  Plankton! Abandon bucket!
"Plankton: Well, that's a write off."
"SpongeBob: Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!"
"Plankton: Not today, SpongeBob. Not today.  But...someday!"
Harold:  Ah.
Nat Peterson: Make it stop! Ah!
Mr. Krabs: Oh.  Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!
"Squidward:  Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone!"
Squidward:  Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then.
"Mr. Krabs:  And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?"
"Bubble Bass: As you can see, this is the first generation Talking Suburban Dad figurine, with realistic burger-flipping motion."
"Suburban Dad Toy: Not right now, Billy. Daddy's had a long day."
Bubble Bass' friends: Ooh.
"Bubble Bass: Suburban Dad! No!  You?  You—will remove that subpar woodwind from the premises, ere I smash its reed!"
Squidward: Can't practice anywhere in this town.  Bunch of tasteless clowns!
"Patrick:  Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh!  Ow! What is that noise?  Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you!"
Squidward:  What are you–  Hm? Uh? Hm?  Oh!
Patrick: You're welcome!
"Squidward:  It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music."
French Narrator: One nap later...
"Squidward:  Are you ready, my dear? We've got the–"
"Squidward:  And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place.  And that's when I saw him, my first suspect.  When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%.  He had to be involved.  SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?"
"SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?"
Squidward: I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me  where!  It!  Is!
"SpongeBob:  I  Don't!  Know!  It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it,  see? There's room for one more."
Squidward:  His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool.
"SpongeBob: You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet."
Squidward: I don't have friends. I have suspects.
"SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet?  So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?"
Squidward: Try not to get in the way.
"SpongeBob: Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean...  All right, I'll partner up with you this time.  Huh?"
"Squidward:  My...  partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little Good cop, bad cop would get his jaw flapping so I–"
"SpongeBob:  Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?"
"Squidward:  Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!"
SpongeBob:  Sorry.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: What the–
"Squidward: Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?  Now, where were you earlier–"
"SpongeBob: You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal?"
"Squidward: What are you doing, SpongeBob?  Manicure?"
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob:  Makeover?
Squidward: Warm blanket?
SpongeBob: New shoes?
Squidward: Hey!
Mr. Krabs:  Enough!
"SpongeBob: Hey, check out the dame."
Mr. Krabs: What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!
"SpongeBob: Oh, uh, we're playing Good cop, good cop. Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!"
"Squidward:  We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!"
"Mr. Krabs: This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove!"
SpongeBob:  Good contours.  And still warm. Story checks out.
"Squidward: All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time.  Come on, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Mm, hmm."
"Mr. Krabs: Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!"
"Squidward:  We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect: maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside."
"Bubble Bass: And then, from the depths of the barbeque, comes the ferocious, fire-breathing  Dad!"
Squidward:  Bubble Bass!  Ow!
Bubble Bass: Huh?
"SpongeBob:  Squidward, wait!  Let him handle this."
Suburban Dad:  Take that! And that!  What?  All right. You've got me cornered. But I won't give up without a fight!
Mermaid Man: I was hoping you'd say that.
"Squidward:  It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys."
Bubble Bass: Wait. Wait! Roll the dice. Did his punch land?
Bubble Bass' friend:  It's a hit!
Suburban Dad: Huh? Oh.
SpongeBob: Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?
Bubble Bass: I don't know what you're talking about. I was here all day. I swear it!
"Suburban Dad: Billy, don't make me turn this boat around."
Bubble Bass: No! I still could have passed you off as near mint!
"Bubble Bass' friends:  Aww. So, sorry, man."
SpongeBob: I am so sorry for your loss.
"Squidward: I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end."
"Squidward:  Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects."
SpongeBob:  Patrick Star?
"Squidward: Um, yeah, how'd you know?"
"Patrick: Hey, guys!"
"Squidward: Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?"
Patrick: I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!
"Squidward: Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!"
"Patrick: Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish."
SpongeBob:  Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...
Squidward: Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!
"SpongeBob: Right behind you, pal.  Huh?  Whoa!"
"Squidward:  When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones."
Squidward: My baby!  Ha!
"SpongeBob: Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play!"
"SpongeBob: Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music."
Patrick: We should solve another mystery now.
"SpongeBob: Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went?  Huh?"
Patrick: Solved!
Jellyfish:  Thank you.
"SpongeBob: Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward!"
"Squidward:  And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by: Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective."
"Old Man Walker: Oh! Pardon me, young lady.  What a fox."
"Plankton:  Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!"
"Old Man Walker:  Eh, eh... I hope I don't miss again."
"Plankton: Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good!  D'oh!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Ooh, ooh, ooh, sweet wampum.  Huh! Whazzat?  Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead!  So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my  arch competitor, Plankton!  For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man.  So long, shrimp!"
"Plankton:  Curse you, Mr. Kraaaaaabs!  Ow!  Ouch!"
"Karen: So, typical day of failure, I see, huh, darling?"
"Plankton: Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub?"
"Karen: Yes, your majesty."
"Plankton: What do we got here?  Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's as big as a whale! I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like."
Karen: Then why don't you just use that Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier thing you built last Tuesday?
"Plankton: What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae.  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mr. Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!"
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob SquarePants: Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.
Mr. Plankton:  At last!
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  There you are, sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton."
"Mr. Plankton: Er, um, hey there, uh, SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Yes, sir!"
"Mr. Plankton: I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!"
Mr. Plankton: Why- why not?
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!"
"Mr. Plankton: The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his—  I mean, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!"
"Mr. Plankton: Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!"
Mr. Plankton: Review?
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Oh, yes, please, sir, please!"
Mr. Plankton: But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!"
"Mr. Plankton: Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: But, sir!"
"Mr. Plankton: I thought I sent you away, cretin!"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!"
"Mr. Plankton: All right, the sauce."
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  Wh-what?
"Mr. Plankton: The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
Mr. Plankton: What?
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Mr. Plankton: What's the matter with you? All I said was A little too much sauce. It's no big deal, really."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Mr. Plankton: What do you want from me, a promotion?!"
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  A pro- a promo- a promotion?!
"Mr. Plankton: Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now."
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  Register!
Mr. Plankton: Glad that's over.
"Alternate-Universe Squidward J. Q. Tentacles:  SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!"
Alternate-Universe Squidward:  Co-Cashier?!
"Mr. Plankton:  So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?"
"Alternate-Universe Squidward:  You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to..."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Alternate-Universe Squidward: Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!
Mr. Plankton: So what do you want me to do about it?
"Alternate-Universe Squidward: I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean."
Mr. Plankton:  Hope you like gray.
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window!"
"Mr. Plankton:  Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—"
"Pearl Plankton:  Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!"
Mr. Plankton: Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!
Pearl Plankton: Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?
Mr. Plankton: If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.
Pearl Plankton: One dollar!? You hate me!
Mr. Plankton: Ow!
Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson:  You!
Mr. Plankton: Me?
Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson: You think this is funny?
"Mr. Plankton: In a cosmic sort of way, yes."
"Alternate-Universe Nat Peterson: Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?!"
"Mr. Plankton: What? It's just an ordinary Krabby—  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Alternate-Universe SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Mr. Plankton] I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did."
"Mr. Plankton: Oh, what now?"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!"
Mr. Plankton: I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?
"Pearl Plankton:  Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!"
"Mr. Plankton: Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: No, sir, he's back."
Mr. Plankton: Who's back? What?  What was that?!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!
Mr. Plankton:  Take cover from what?!?
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!
Mr. Plankton: What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!
Alternate-Universe Harold Bill Reginald Scott: Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.
Pearl Plankton: He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.
"Krabs: And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!"
Mr. Plankton: Krabs?! What the barnacles is going on here?!
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant."
Mr. Plankton: That's terrible!
Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Yeah! But the worst part is...
"Mr. Plankton:  Good grief, he's naked!"
"Krabs:  Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes... no service!"
"Krabs: Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!"
Mr. Plankton:  I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!"
"Krabs: Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob: You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!"
"Krabs: Oh, but I will! Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob:  Phone call, Mr. Plankton."
"Krabs:  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day..."
"Mr. Plankton:  It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy.  Holographic meatloaf? My favorite!"
"Narrator: Ah. Another quiet day in Bikini Bottom. But it wasn't always this way. Once, it was horrible.  The unimaginable happened. One day, SpongeBob SquarePants... changed his pants!  I remember it as if it were yesterday. But, in fact, in happened three days ago."
"SpongeBob: It's laundry day, Gary!  Oops."
Gary:  Meow.
SpongeBob: ) Now to finish the day's chores.  Hello?
"Patrick: Hello. Uh, may I speak with SpongeBob, uh, uh...  ...Squaaa...re...Paaaaants?"
"SpongeBob: Mm, speaking."
"Patrick: Hey, hey. You want to hear how long I can do this for?"
"SpongeBob: Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait?"
Patrick:  No.
Narrator: Much later...
"SpongeBob: Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer."
"Gary: Meow, meow."
Narrator: Much much later...
Patrick: A pretty long time. Huh?
"SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick.  Gary?  They've shrunk!  I'm gonna need to get new pants."
"Clerk: I'm sorry, Mr. SpongeBob, but we're not expecting another shipment of square pants for months."
"SpongeBob: Oh.  No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh.  Whoa, these pants hug my body better than my own mother!  Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose."
Patrick: Do I know you?
"SpongeBob:  It's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick: SpongeBob?  No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger."
SpongeBob: Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me.
"Sandy: Well, howdy, stranger! I don't recognize you in those newfangled dungarees.  You must be SpongeBob FancyPants. Clothes really do make the man!"
"SpongeBob: Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head.  But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together."
"Squidward:  Oh, no. It's that little yellow freak."
"SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward!"
Squidward:  Just ignore him. Maybe he'll go away.
"SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! Guess who?"
Squidward:  Do I know you?
"SpongeBob: Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants."
Squidward: Never seen you before in my life.
"SpongeBob: Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory.  Me and you at my birthday party.  You and me at work.  That little slumber party we had last week.  I forgot when this was taken."
Squidward:  Is that supposed to be you?  I can't believe it. He actually left.
"SpongeBob: Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right.  Oh no, it's locked.  Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants."
Patrick: Hello. Can I help you?
"SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick: Oh, right. You're that round pants fellow."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing in my house?"
Patrick: Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us.  I wish I could see him one last time.
"SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again.  Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq...  Sorry, I'm a little...  I'm a little...  I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... RoundPants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment.  Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh!  Here are the applications.  Let's see here. Name.  SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well.  Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers!  Question two. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Hmm, what's a felony?"
Squidward: Being too darn happy all the time!
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies."
Squidward:  Moron.
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here?!
SpongeBob: I'm filling out an application.
Mr. Krabs: Get to work.
SpongeBob:  Then I got the job?!
Mr. Krabs:  Oh boy.
SpongeBob: My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo!
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob:  You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes?
"Squidward: Oh, I'd love to."
SpongeBob: Yay!
Squidward: But...no! Don't...
SpongeBob: So what do I do first?
Squidward:  Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill.
SpongeBob: Shouldn't you watch it?
Squidward: Why? I don't think it's going anywhere.
"SpongeBob: Ooh, very Zen.  What next, oh, oracle of Krabby wisdom?"
Squidward: I'm going to the bathroom.
"SpongeBob: Hmm, I'll go, too.  How's it going in there, boss?"
Squidward: Um... fine.
"SpongeBob:  Going fine.  Oh, Mr. Squidward...  Whatcha reading?  Bathroom break. Check."
Squidward: Here's the slop you ordered.  Enjoy. If you can choke it down.
SpongeBob:  Be rude to customers and insult food. Nasally laugh.
Customer: Can I get a Krabby Patty Combo?
Squidward: No.
Customer: How about a Double Krabby?
SpongeBob: No.
Customer: Can I get a Triple Patty with cheese?
SpongeBob:  Oh I think you've had way too many of those.
Squidward: Taught him everything he knows.
"Mr. Krabs:  What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants."
"SpongeBob: I am not SpongeBob SquarePants, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Davy Jones are you talking about?
"SpongeBob: I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round."
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, so?"
SpongeBob: I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants.
Mr. Krabs: Who told you that?
SpongeBob: Patrick.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, why don't you just take them off?"
"SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward."
Sandy: Well if it isn't SpongeBob UnderPants!
"Mr. Krabs:  ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!"
"Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. Here ya are."
"Pearl: Oh, you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are wearing, would it? Everyone wants them."
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...they might be.
"Pearl: Whee!  Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have.  I mean, Dad,  you really shouldn't have!"
"Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!"
"Pearl: Dad, you ruined me!"
"Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain!  Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?"
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots.  So you want to get paid?"
"SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way."
Mr. Krabs:  In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
"SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots."
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry."
SpongeBob: ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
"Mr. Krabs: Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable."
SpongeBob: Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You've got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And...
"Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack!  You got yourself a deal."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!"
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
"Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music."
"Mr. Krabs:  Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty...  Wha? Who's there?  Back to countin' me money.  One, two, three, four, five...  What the barnacle is that?  Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work."
"Squidward: That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now."
"Mr. Krabs:  What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?"
Squidward: I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week.
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob.
"Mr. Krabs: I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots."
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh..."
"SpongeBob: Or could he do this?  Or this?  And watch this, Mr. Krabs!"
Squeaky Boots: May I take your order?
"Francis: Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special."
"Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready."
"SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I, uhh..."
"SpongeBob: And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this."
Mr. Krabs:   I gotta go to my office!  I can still hear it!  It's still coming through! The infernal squeak!  Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
"SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off."
Gary:  Meow.
"SpongeBob: Good night, Gary."
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money."
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
"Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!"
"Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son."
"SpongeBob:  No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
"Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world."
"SpongeBob: Yes, it is!"
"Mr. Krabs: Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts!"
SpongeBob:  They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots.
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad.
Tom: Excuse me?
"Mr. Krabs: I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?"
"Tom: Yeah, I'm ready to order."
Mr. Krabs:  What'll ya have?
Tom: I'll take a .
Mr. Krabs:  What did you say?
"Tom: I said, I'll take a ."
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
"SpongeBob:  I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants ."
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a .
Mr. Krabs: Huh?  Huh?  I didn't write that!
"SpongeBob:  Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this..."
"Mr. Krabs:  Stop it!  Stop... it!  Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards!  Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots!  I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more!  The deed is done."
"SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook."
"SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  I need a vacation."
"SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl."
"Pearl:  Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!"
"Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won't.  Oh, no."
"SpongeBob: ♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude♪"
"Squidward: Oh, is that supposed to be singing?  I am putting that one on SpongeBob.  Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!"
SpongeBob: ♪I cherish my fellow residents...♪
"Squidward: SpongeBob, why are you doing this?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!"
Squidward: Gratitude? You've been wallowing in filth all morning. What could you possibly be grateful for?
"SpongeBob: Hit it, boys! ♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude. A lifetime subscription to gratitude. Friend, you've got to change your latitude. Live an attitude of gratitude, I'm grateful for the life I'm living. Who knows how long I will have it? I'm thankful for all I've been given. We make appreciation a habit. There's no time like the present day to have a present come your way!"
Slimy trash can monsters: All you have to do it grab it!
SpongeBob: So now I think that you will see.
Slimy trash can monsters: You'll see.
"SpongeBob: There's nothing more you need. My friend, this ain't no platitude."
Slimy trash can creatures: Platitude!
SpongeBob: Just an attitude of gratitude.♪
Slimy trash can creatures: Gratitude!
"SpongeBob: Or, in your case, Squidward, an attitude of hattitude!"
Squidward: Keep your hat and your gratitude! Because having you as a neighbor has left me with nothing to be grateful for!
"SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you should really consider getting your plumbing looked at."
Squidward: This is your fault!
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand."
"Squidward: No, you have helped me enough. I don't want your help ever again!"
"SpongeBob: No problem, pal."
"Squidward: Moron.  Stupid pipe!  Oh, great. Now I'm late for work."
Pardon me!
"Scooter: Whoa! Slow down, Speedster!"
Squidward: Go jump in a coral pit.
"Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, how many times do I have to tell you? The customers' jokes are always funny! Now, give the gentlemen a chuckle."
Squidward: Ha ha ha.
"Scooter: I knew you would eventually get it, dude."
"Squidward: Stop staring, SpongeBob. You're affecting my productivity."
Sandals: I would like to order one Krabby Patty.
Squidward: That'll be three dollars.
Sandals:  Do you accept pennies?
Squidward: I don't have time to count all that!
"Sandals: Oh, well, have it your way. I'll just take my loose change elsewhere!"
"Squidward: Oh, please do, I'm trying to get some work done here. Sheesh, some people just want to waste your time.  Hey, buddy! How am I supposed to focus with all of that incessant tapping? And what do you think you're doing, sir?"
Nat: I'm holding the door for the nice lady.
"Squidward: No, you're not. You're leaving your grubby finger prints all over the glass! And now yours truly is gonna have to clean it up! Why does everyone insist on making my job so difficult?!  You always leave trash on the table!  Your teeth chatter!  Your hat annoys me!  You take too long in the restroom!  And SpongeBob, would you quit singing that song?"
"SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?"
"Squidward:  SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?"
"SpongeBob: Well, it could be worse."
Squidward: How could life in Bikini Bottom possibly get any worse?
Nat: Mount Bikini Bottom's erupting!
SpongeBob: That's how.
Lloyd: Cool.
"Scooter: Look, the roof!"
"Mr. Krabs: Eh, ya lemmings. Afraid of a little lavar? CASHY! No! Make it stop raining fiery destruction!"
"SpongeBob: Sorry to interrupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it?  Fear not, shelter can't be far a-"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? Civilization as we know is crumbling to dust!  Civic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence!"
"Old Woman:  What are you boys doing out still? Plenty of room at the Volcano Shelter! Hey, but no more roughhousing, you got that?!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, yes. Of course, ma'am.  Try and behave yourselves, fellers."
"Mayor: No need to get excited, citizens. The government is working tirelessly to defeat this evil volcano."
Billy: What are we gonna do?
Mayor: Don't worry. We've got it under control.
"Billy:  Under control? Half the city's on fire! You call THAT under control? Huh? Do ya?  The end is near, Mayor."
"Harold: That guy's on to something. What are you hiding from us, Mayor? Do you have some secret? Is the end near?"
"SpongeBob: Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something."
"Mayor: Oh! Yes, boy? How do you propose we stop the volcano?"
"SpongeBob:  Actually, I just had a question about these parking tickets. I don't have a car."
"Squidward: Oh, boy. Moron."
Mayor: We're doomed!
Dolphin Warrior:  You fools!
Mayor: Who are you?
"Dolphin Warrior:  I am an ancient warrior from long ago. The last of my kind who ruled over the ocean from before the dawn of time. But, alas, my people were wiped out by the same volcano that plagues you now."
Harold: Then how did you survive?
"Dolphin Warrior:  I survived, because I was the only one who knew how to stop it!"
"Harold: Well, don't keep us in suspense. How did you stop it?"
Dolphin Warrior: You must make... a sacrifice!
Harold: What kind of sacrifice?
Dolphin Warrior: A sacrifice must be made of the most miserable person.
Harold: I knew it! We have to sacrifice the most miserable person!
Monica: And who would that be?
"Harold: Well, it certainly isn't me!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, who do you think is the most miserable person?"
"Squidward: Don't know, don't care."
"SpongeBob: But, Squidward, it's imperative that we..."
"Squidward:  But, Squidward, it is imperative that we...  Nothing! I think I'd rather take my chances with the volcano than be stuck in this miserable barnacle hole with you  and the citizens of Dumb-Dumb Town!"
"Man: Oh, oh, we're idiots now! Oh, nice! Nice!"
Woman:  I'm a solitary smart woman.
Squidward: What?
"Male Fish:  Miserable Squidward! Oh, you are miserable!"
Squidward: You idiots! You've got the wrong guy!
Dale: We heard you complaining about the fingerprints.
Nat: And the foot tapping.
Sandals: And my loose change.
Mabel: And my teeth!  And his hat!
Scooter: And you called your pipe stupid.
Lloyd: And the fact that you said you were the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom!
"Squidward:  I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! Oh, would you just...  Let me down, you goons!"
"Mayor: Sorry, Mr. Tentacles. Throw him in, fellas."
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Wait! It is I who makes Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead.
Mayor: Works for me.
"Squidward: Well, I'm glad that y'all came to your senses. Bunch of ingrates. Come on, SpongeBob. Jump in."
SpongeBob: Squidward!
"Squidward:  SpongeBob, help!"
"SpongeBob: I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!"
"Squidward: I take it back!  Please SpongeBob, I didn't mean any of that! I do appreciate your friendship. I am grateful. I'm... I'm...  I'm grateful for the life I'm living! Who knows how long I'll have it? I learned that from you, remember? Goodbye, everyone!  Huh?"
"SpongeBob:  Squidward, I always knew you felt that way.  Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us."
Squidward: My house!
"Dolphin Warrior: Ah, now the volcano is appeaved!"
Squidward: But I thought you said a sacrifice had to be made of the most miserable person.
"Dolphin Warrior:  No! You didn't let me finish. I was trying to say, a sacrifice of the most miserable person's house. No one ever listens to me."
"Squidward: You know SpongeBob, in light of everything that just happened... I lied to you. I am not grateful for anything! I mean look at me. I don't even have a roof to sleep under, anymore!"
"SpongeBob: Well, I wouldn't say that."
Squidward: Go away.
Plankton: What is going on here?!
Karen: What's wrong now?
"Plankton: Same as always, look, empty again!"
Karen: So what are you gonna do about it?
Plankton: I don't know anymore!
"Karen: Hey, hey, hey, why don't you just work on a new recipe?"
Plankton: What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years!
Nat: Hello!
Plankton: Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?
"Nat: Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick."
Plankton:  What?!
"Nat: Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks."
Plankton: You're kidding right?
"Nat: No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick."
"Plankton: Uh, okay if you insist.  Oh, no, please don't sue me!  I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum!"
"Nat: Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow.  Here you go. See you in the morning."
Plankton:  Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!
Karen: How'd you pull that off?
"Plankton: Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me, Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more.  Now, I wait. I wait until he returns.  I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait."
Narrator: 8 hours later...
"Plankton: Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What?  Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true."
Nat: Hey!
"Plankton: Well, hello, Nat!"
Nat: I came back like I said yesterday.
"Plankton: You certainly did, didn't you?"
"Nat: I'd like another Chum Stick, please."
"Plankton: Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here."
"Nat: Oh, boy!"
Plankton: Is it okay?
"Nat:  Okay?!  It's perfection!  Hey, how about I have another?"
Plankton: You betcha!
"Nat: Whoo, boy! I cannot believe how good these things are."
"Plankton: Oh, well, you know."
"Nat: All right, see you tomorrow."
Plankton: What?! You're coming back again?
"Nat: Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands!"
"Plankton: Oh, my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge!"
"Mr. Krabs: ♪Rolling, rolling, rolling! Money keeps on rolling along!♪  One more time!  No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time or any time!"
Plankton: Don't bother. There's no need.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about?
"Plankton:  I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now."
"Mr. Krabs:  You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!"
"Nat: Hey, Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?"
"Plankton: But of course, loyal customer.  I'll see you later, loser. Much later!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!"
"SpongeBob: Yes, sir!"
Mr. Krabs: Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties.
"SpongeBob: Oh, you can count on me, sir.  Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here.  Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?"
Nat:  No thanks.
"SpongeBob: Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oaf. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later."
"Nat: Yeah, do me a favor.  From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself."
"SpongeBob: Oh, fishpaste!"
"Plankton: Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet chum."
"Karen: Yes, Your Diminutiveness."
"Plankton: Say, Nat, do you have any friends?"
Nat: Nope.
"Plankton: Would you hurry up with that chum, Karen?!"
"SpongeBob:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop.  There's your chum, bleep blap blop."
"Nat: Hey, this doesn't look like chum."
Plankton: And that doesn't look like Karen!
"SpongeBob: Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me."
"Plankton: What have you done with Karen, you brute?!"
"Nat: How many times do I have to tell you?  I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I love chum! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else!"
SpongeBob: So you're saying that you love chum? And all that you ever eat is chum?
Nat: Yeah! Th-that's right!
SpongeBob: Interesting.
Nat: A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me.
"SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Welcome, valued customer!"
Nat: This isn't the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs:  Why go to the Chum Bucket when the Krusty Krab has added tasty chum to our menu?
"Nat: That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand chum."
"Mr. Krabs: But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say?  You like it?"
Nat: It's...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah?
Nat: It's...
"Mr. Krabs: Well, what do you think?"
Nat: It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted!  I'm going back to Plankton's chum.
Mr. Krabs: What am I going to do?! I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer!  I just can't afford it!
SpongeBob: I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.
"Mr. Krabs: But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum.  That's it boyo!  Where could it be?  There! Plankton's secret formula!  It's gotta be in here..."
"Plankton:  What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?"
"Mr. Krabs: Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony."
"Plankton: Ouch, double irony!"
"SpongeBob: Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist.  I mean, just think about that.  You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the..."
Plankton: Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.
"Karen: Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash."
Mr. Krabs: Look at all that loot!
"Plankton: That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my chum!"
"Mr. Krabs: D'oh, just put me out of me misery!"
"Plankton: Back for more of my delicious chum, I see!"
Nat: Not this time.
Plankton and Mr. Krabs: Huh?
"Nat:  Not ever again!  The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!"
Plankton: Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?
"Nat: I have eaten ten of those things, and I've all ready had to go to the doctor...twice!  If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again."
"Plankton: What's the deal, Karen?"
"Karen: The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining."
"Plankton: All this time, I never had one regular customer?"
Karen: Duh.
Plankton: Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
"Karen: Uhh, there he goes again. Cut it out, Plankton!"
"Plankton: What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me!"
"SpongeBob: Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!"
Mr. Krabs: What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed meself more! This irony's pretty good stuff!
Mr. Krabs: Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
SpongeBob:  New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Squidward: What?! That is totally unfair!
SpongeBob: Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or--
Squidward: Zip it!
"Mr. Krabs: What the...?!  The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?! So, that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he?"
Fish: Sure. I don't know. Why not?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, he's wrong!"
"Fish: Oh, okay. Sure."
"Mr. Krabs: As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours!"
"SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming.  Well, I'm not dreaming."
"Plankton:  Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula!  Why aren't you laughing?"
Karen: I've heard this joke before.
"Mr. Krabs: All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw! Day 3!"
"SpongeBob:  Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete."
Mr. Krabs: Day 10 of non-stop service!
"Squidward:  Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?"
Mr. Krabs: No one goes home!
Squidward:  Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags!
"Mr. Krabs: Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?"
"SpongeBob:  ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪"
Mr. Krabs: You could learn a few things from that boy.
"Squidward:  Mr. Krabs, he is not normal."
"Mr. Krabs: All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work."
"Plankton: Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion! But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg , and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche."
Mr. Krabs: Eww! A spider bug.
Plankton: Come on!
"Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order?  10,000 Krabby Patties?! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again?  Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute, this isn't some kind of prank, is it?"
Plankton: Eh...no.
"Mr. Krabs: Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton."
"Mr. Krabs: Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order!  I'm counting on you, boy! I need you to raise that spatular!  Yeah! And I need you to say, Team Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob: Team Krusty Krab!
"Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties.  And no breaks!"
"SpongeBob:  Did you hear that, spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks!  Wow!"
Mr. Krabs: Day 15! Give it up for day 15!
SpongeBob: ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...♪
"SpongeBob: 1,322..."
Mr. Krabs: Day 23! Give it up for day 23!
"SpongeBob: 6,654..."
Mr. Krabs: Day 30!
"SpongeBob: 7,121..."
Mr. Krabs: Day...35...!
"SpongeBob: 8,659..."
"Old Man Walker: Wait, what's going on? Whoa, whoa!"
Mr. Krabs: Day...  anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
Squidward:  43...!
"Mr. Krabs: What the flimflam?!  What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food.  Boy?"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?"
"Mr. Krabs: Boy, I'm worried that...  Got it?"
"SpongeBob:  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?"
"Mr. Krabs: Sure, I said I'm worried that..."
"SpongeBob: That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal:  Stay back! I'm warning you!"
Mr. Krabs:  All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to...
"SpongeBob: No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy!  Holy shrimp! They're everywhere!"
Krabby Patty:  What?
SpongeBob:
Sally: I told you that shirt was hideous.
"SpongeBob: No, no! I want to live!  I want to live"
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties."
"Mr. Krabs:  There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular."
SpongeBob:  Spatular.
Mr. Krabs:  and here's the grill.
SpongeBob:  Grill.
Mr. Krabs:  and here are some fresh Krabby...
"Mr. Krabs: Hmm, there may be a problem after all."
SpongeBob: What does this mean?
"Mr Krabs: It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional."
SpongeBob: Wrestler?
"Mr. Krabs: No, a psychiatrist."
"SpongeBob: Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?  Ow!  Hey, look at this! Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias. Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see...  Well, this looks like the place.  Hello? Doctor?"
"Plankton: Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch.  Now...  Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head."
"SpongeBob: You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink . Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?"
"Plankton: Hope? Hope!? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you!  Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time."
"SpongeBob: Oh, good."
Plankton: Let's start with a simple exercise.
SpongeBob: Jumping jacks?
"Plankton: I want you to close your eyes.  Tighter  Tighter  Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?"
SpongeBob: I see giant Krabby Patties!
"Plankton: Good, and what are they made of?"
SpongeBob: Hatred!
"Plankton: No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?!"
SpongeBob: They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back!
"Plankton: Wait, where'd you get that piano?  We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?"
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Plankton: Work.
SpongeBob: Work.
Plankton: Spatula.
SpongeBob: Spatula.
Plankton: Bun.
SpongeBob: Bun.
"Plankton: See, the key is to say something different to what I say."
"SpongeBob: Oh, okay, I've got it."
Plankton: Potato.
SpongeBob: Potahto.
Plankton: Tomato.
SpongeBob: Tomahto.
"Plankton: I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know… oh, yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that."
"SpongeBob: Um, you're making me nervous."
"Plankton: Oh, okay.  I'll be over here, then."
SpongeBob: I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano.
"Plankton: Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you."
SpongeBob: Fiber?
"Plankton: No, hypnosis."
SpongeBob: Hypnosis?!
"Plankton:  Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula.  Hey, wake up!  Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious?  Why won't you wake up?!"
SpongeBob: Where am I?
"Krabby Patty: Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza."
"SpongeBob: Gee, thanks!"
Krabby Patty: And here's some chocolate milk.
"SpongeBob: The king of flavored dairy drinks!  Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again."
"Krabby Patty: Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here  ."
SpongeBob: In my heart?
"Krabby Patty: Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up."
Plankton:  Wake up!
SpongeBob:  It worked! I'm cured!
Plankton: But what about the formula?
"SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!"
"Plankton:  No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick!"
"Mr. Krabs: Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I can safely say, No more 24 hour shifts, because 23 hours will be plenty!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs...!"
"Mr. Krabs: No, seriously. Get back to work!"
Mrs. Puff: Look out! Oh!
Driver 1: Learn how to drive!
SpongeBob: I'm trying!
"Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff!"
SpongeBob: Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles!
Mrs. Puff: No blowing bubbles while driving!
Mrs. Puff: Phew!
Driver 2: I can't feel my big toe.
"SpongeBob: So, uh, how'd I do?"
Mrs. Puff:  Get out! You're never getting a boating license!
SpongeBob:  But—but—
Mrs. Puff:  Never! Never!
"SpongeBob: I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!"
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ooh...
Tina Fran: It's really nice.
"Larry: Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston.  We're talking some serious muscle!"
"Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash!  Isn't it?"
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?"
"Patrick: Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now."
"SpongeBob: Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later."
Patrick: Catch!
"Bubble Mrs. Puff: You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license."
SpongeBob: Ooh!  Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles.  Oh! That's it!
Abigail Marge: Whoa!
Tom: What is that?
Girls: Oh!
"SpongeBob: All right, all right."
"SpongeBob: Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?"
"Motorcycle Cop: Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um..."
SpongeBob:  You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
"Motorcycle Cop: Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen."
SpongeBob: Gary!
Gary:
"SpongeBob: You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!"
SpongeBob: Then I made a right turn on red like this.
"SpongeBob: You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!"
Gary:  Meow.
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Green Fish: I'm here for a bubble boat.
"Martin: Uh, yeah, me too!"
Dave: I want one!
"Various people: Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats."
Green Fish: Please?
"SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves."
SpongeBob: One bubble boat coming right up!
Green Fish: Thank you!
"Plankton: Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: I sure do, Plankton!"
Plankton: Oof!
"Plankton: Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets!"
"[Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds."
Plankton: Ouch!
Plankton: Strike fear...
"Larry: Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: I'm on it, Larry!"
"Larry: Now, this is what I call a muscle car!"
"Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry!"
SpongeBob:  I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo!
"Mrs. Puff:  Greetings, class. My name is—"
"Mrs. Puff:  Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses.  I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor."
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Bah!
"Fred: Hey, watch it, lady!"
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
Tom: I'm driving over here!
"Mable: Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Mrs. Puff: Oh—wah!
"Clay: Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain!"
"Motorcycle Cop: I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?"
Mrs. Puff: You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?
"Motorcycle Cop: What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am."
"Motorcycle Cop: Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal."
Mrs. Puff: But I've never driven a bubble!
Mrs. Puff: Bubble boating school?
Mrs. Puff: Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob.  Please don't be SpongeBob.
"SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Hi, Mrs. Puff."
Mrs. Puff: Of course.
"SpongeBob: You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P.  You'll be learning from a master."
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Mrs. Puff: Great.
"SpongeBob: Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this."
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ooh! Oh!
SpongeBob: Nice start.
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Fire!
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.
Mrs. Puff: I did it.
"SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you're ready."
Mrs. Puff: Really?
SpongeBob: Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there.
Mrs. Puff:  Oh.
SpongeBob: Nice and easy. Doing great.
Harold: Hello!
"Mrs. Puff: You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad.  Maybe I could—"
"SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!"
SpongeBob: It's okay! Just calm down!
Mrs. Puff: Eeh! Oh!
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: Ah!
SpongeBob: Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
SpongeBob: Doh!
Mrs. Puff:  No more bubbles. Get them off me!
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles?"
Motorcycle Cop:  Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats!
"SpongeBob: Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪"
"Mrs. Puff:  Oh, joy."
"Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here for Bikini Bottom News. Today, SpongeBob SquarePants will attempt the impossible: a high-sea dive from that diving board!  He'll be the first sponge ever to dive up through the ocean."
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!"
Monroe Timmy: Whoa.
"SpongeBob Statue:  Pretty cool, huh, kid?"
"SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up."
SpongeBob: That's good. I'm all warmed up.
"Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees here! Buy one and take home a hero!  Here you are,  here!  Here!"
"Patrick:  Hey, SpongeBob. What's new?  Oh, so that's how it is, huh? The silent treatment. Well, two can play at that game, mister!"
Bubble Bass: Excuse me. How much for this stupid starfish standee?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Hmm.  20 bucks?
Bubble Bass:  But it's damaged.
Mr. Krabs: 10 bucks?
Bubble Bass:  Sold!
SpongeBob:  Hi-uh!
Perch Perkins: And here's our hero now with the flag he will plant on the surface.
SpongeBob: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Ahh! Ooh.
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees right here. Buy one and take home a loser.
SpongeBob:  I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
"Sandy: Well, back in Texas, Olympic divers have gravity to help them go down. What you need is anti-gravity to go up."
SpongeBob: Anti-gravity? Yes!  Yah!
Squidward:  Hmph. Stupid messy moron rubbernecking flounders and so on...
SpongeBob: I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
SpongeBob: I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge.
"SpongeBob: Hey, what happened to the surface?"
"SpongeBob: Hmm. Huh?  Aw, gee, and I was so close.  Hmm? What is this place?"
SpongeBob: Oh!
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
"SpongeBob: This place is trash-tastic!  Ow!  Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh!"
Dave: What's that?

Old Man Jenkins: I'm King Neptune! Feel my power!
SpongeBob: Ow! Old Man Jenkins?
Old Man Jenkins: I'm not Old Man Jenkins anymore! I'm King Neptune! Take that!
"SpongeBob:  Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon!"
Old Man Jenkins:  Oh!
"Business Man: Hmm? Neptune is blessing us with gifts and treasures!  Surf's up, dude!"
"Nat Peterson: Oh, yeah! All right! Ho-ho!"
"Little Girl #1: You say your desire into the balloon, blow it up, and send it to Neptune.  A slice of pizza."

"Old Man Jenkins: What are you, senile?"
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. I'm juvenile!
"Citizen #1: Hey, what happened?"
Citizen #2: What's going on here?
Harold: Why isn't Neptune sending us more gifts down for us?
Gale Rechid: We must have upset him.
"Harold: You must have upset him!  This is for you, Neptune! Oohh—"
Gale Rechid: Wait! Look!
"Citizen #3: Oh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen."
Citizen #4: What is it?
Gale Rechid: What do you think it is?
Harold: It's a ladder from Neptune! Let's climb up and get more free stuff!
Gale Rechid: Me first!
SpongeBob: Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that!  I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
Old Man Jenkins: Big whoop.

Old Man Jenkins: I smell like toast. Am I breakfast?  Needs jelly.
"Mr. Krabs: Hmm?  Ooh, well, look at that. Someone threw away a good SpongeBob standee.  Yagh!  Oof!  Ugh."
SpongeBob: They called me a hero.
SpongeBob:  Your turn.
Patrick: Now you.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick:  Yes, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with...  two sticks?
"Patrick: Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!"
"SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing Stick in a Cup."
Nathiel Waters:  Are you tired of playing with an old stick and a cup?
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Yeah.
"Nathiel Waters:  Well, say goodbye to boring and hello to whirly brains! The exciting new toy that puts you in the driver's seat of your own mind! It's so simple! Just flip your lid, attach the propeller, and watch your brain soar hundreds of feet into the air as you control the action!"

"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain."
"SpongeBob: Step one...  Oh, I see what to do."
"SpongeBob:  It's just me, Patrick."
Patrick: Oh!
"SpongeBob: Now, you do me!"
Patrick: Boo!
SpongeBob: It's time to free our minds!
"SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angle before!"
"Patrick:  And the propeller tickles my think folds!  Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!"
SpongeBob: Eye bump!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?"
Patrick:  I feel you.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whirly freeze!

Squidward:  The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can...  let it all hang out.  Me...

Mr. Krabs: What a woman!
"Mrs. Puff:  Oh, Eugene!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: What was that?
"Kid: Oh, that smarts!  Bullseye!"
Patrick: I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!
Kid: What are you? Thick? Every kid in town's got a whirly brain!
"Buddy: Daddy, daddy! Can I have a whirly brain too?"
"Fred: Absolutely not, son. Your brain is your body's most important organ, not a toy."
"SpongeBob: Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!"
Kid: Eat my brainstem slowpoke!

Patrick: Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness.
"SpongeBob: Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!"
Patrick:  M-O-O-N.  That spells moon!
"SpongeBob: Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!"
"Patrick: I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy!"
"Patrick: Here, brains!"
"SpongeBob: Brainy, where are you?"
"Patrick: Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: I've found mine too!
"SpongeBob: Oh, darn it. I still can't see."
"Patrick: Yeah, my brain won't fit back in."
"SpongeBob: Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something."
Nazz: That's okay. You can keep it.
Patrick: I'll take it!

SpongeBob: Ew! Give me that!

"SpongeBob: Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy."
Patrick: Okay. Sandy!
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, I meant on the phone."
Sandy:  Hello?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy!
Sandy: Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.
"SpongeBob: Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things."
Sandy: And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds.  Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.
"Sandy: Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?"
"Sandy: We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!"
Sandy: This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in...

SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!

"SpongeBob, Sandy and Patrick: Huh?"
Angry Old Timer: What are you sneak thieves doing into my house? Them brains violated my air space and I'm keepin' them! I'm callin' the cops!
"Sandy: Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!"
"Angry Old Timer: Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!"
"Sandy: Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room."
"Fred: Oh, Brainy, you're back!"
SpongeBob: Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again!
"Sandy: Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll..."
"Angry Old Timer:  I'm sorry, Squirrel Lady! I just couldn't take watching all the kids have fun in the air while I'm stuck here with this crotchety cane on the ground!"
SpongeBob and Sandy: Aww!
"Sandy: Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Sandy: I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: My think is clogged.
Sandy: Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today.
"SpongeBob: Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today."
Angry Old Timer:  Look out my dears below! Take a ride on the love copter!
Squidward: The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! You're next!
"Radio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days."
"♪You're old... Groaning like a geezer♪  ♪Feel yourself a-crackin' like an old has-been♪  ♪Look at yourself, old man, you've got multiple chins♪  ♪'Cause you're old...♪"
"Pearl Krabs: Good morning, Daddy.  I made you breakfast."
"Mr. Krabs: Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today."
"Pearl: Open up, it's time for the pill."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill.  Pearl, do you think I'm... old?"
"Pearl: Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old."
"Mr. Krabs: But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?"
"Pearl: See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say coral, as in, That nose job is so coral."
"Mr. Krabs: Coral, eh?"
"Pearl: Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral."
"Pearl: Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?"
"Mr. Krabs: Whoop, you're right!  Have a coral day, honey."
Pearl:  Jenny? It's Pearl. Coral is definitely out.
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh?
"Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little...  Sorry you had to see that."
"Harold: Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks."
"Tyler: Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?"
"Mr. Krabs:  Hey, how's about I join you kids?"
"Tyler: Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people always have to ruin the fun?"
"Elderly Fish #1: Hey, no cuttin'! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else!"
Mr. Krabs: No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old!
Elderly Fish #2: What's his problem?
Lou: Next?
"Timmy: Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny."
"Mother: Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there.  Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage."
"Timmy: ♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...♪"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster.  Hmmm, so that's what I taste like."
"Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!"
"SpongeBob:  Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?"
"Patrick:  Yeah, it's gonna rock!"
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go crazy?
Patrick: I'm already hearing voices!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to—
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!
"SpongeBob: Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!"
"Patrick: Well, how rude of some people!"
"Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town."
SpongeBob: Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!
Patrick: Party!
SpongeBob: What do you think we should do first?
"Patrick: What shouldn't we do first? We're young,  we've got wheels,  the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys, hangin' out?"
Patrick:  Yes.
"Mr. Krabs: I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?"
"SpongeBob: Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!"
"Patrick: I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style."
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Style!
Patrick: Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake.
"Mr. Krabs: Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh..."
Patrick: I'm waiting... old man.
Mr. Krabs:  Uhh... how do you do?
"Patrick: Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it."
"SpongeBob: You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
"SpongeBob: I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late."
French Narrator: 8:01 PM.
"SpongeBob: Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?"
"Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?"
"Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par-
"Pearl: Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad!"
"Mr. Krabs: So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?"
SpongeBob: Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker.
Mr. Krabs: It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
"SpongeBob: Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself."
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?
SpongeBob: Only the cool kids.
"Hot rod fish: Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!"
"SpongeBob: We're not lost, I've got my compass."
"Hot rod fish: So long, dorks!"
"SpongeBob: Goodbye, pals!"
Mr. Krabs: We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now.
SpongeBob: Here we are: The Wash.
"Mr. Krabs: They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now."
"SpongeBob: Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool."
Mr. Krabs: Cool. Gotcha.
"SpongeBob:  Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!"
Patrick: Let's party!
Mr. Krabs: Any port in the store—! Wait a minute...this is a Laundromat.
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talkin’ about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo!"
SpongeBob: You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.
"Mr. Krabs: You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!"
Patrick: Debauchery!
"Mr. Krabs: Debauchery!  Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into..."
"SpongeBob: So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: Not yet.
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, you will.  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: I'm feeling a warm spot.
Patrick: Sorry.
"SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?"
"Patrick: I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, that's not a ride."
Harold: Get off of me!
"SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?"
Miss Shell:  Shhh!
"SpongeBob: How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?"
"Kids: Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: So, you wanna know if I can feel it?"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah, yeah!"
Mr. Krabs: Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yes!
Mr. Krabs:  I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
SpongeBob:  Lame?!
Mr. Krabs: Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Not 'babies!'
"Mr. Krabs: I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!"
Patrick: I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: The what?
"Patrick: I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid."
"Mr. Krabs: Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?"
Patrick: Yeah.
"Mr. Krabs: And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?"
"Patrick: Oh, yeah."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Not lame!
Mr. Krabs: Now this is more like it!
"Patrick: Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals!"
SpongeBob: We score here all the time.
Mr. Krabs: Frilly things! We hit the jackpot!
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs:  You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again!"
Mama Krabs: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Mother?
Mama Krabs: What are you doing with my bloomers?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh,  hehe...  Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!"
SpongeBob: Why didn't you ask?
Mr. Krabs:  But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
"Mama Krabs: Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Yes, Mommy."
"Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room."
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs:  That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger."
"SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Good night, SpongeBob."
"Mama Krabs:  Eugene, lights out!"
"Mr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy."
"Sandals: Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?"
Squidward: I like neither. Can I take your order?
"Sandals: What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?"
Squidward: No. What will you have?
"Sandals: Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?"
"Squidward:  Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?"
"SpongeBob:  Psst, try the coral bits."
"Sandals: Uhh, I'll try the coral bits."
Squidward: That'll be one dollar.
Sandals: What's going on?
"Squidward: Something stupid, I'm sure."
Mr. Krabs: Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Squidward: See? I told you.
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
"Mr. Krabs:  Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!"
Squidward: A very dirty dollar?
"Mr. Krabs: No, this is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir, you have just given me my one millionth dollar!"
"Sandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?"
"Mr. Krabs: Nothing, now get out."
"Sandals: Uhh, what?"
"Mr. Krabs: Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar."
"SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip."
"SpongeBob: Wow, a trip!"
"Squidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where are we going? Fancy Springs?"
Mr. Krabs: No...
Squidward: Pamper Island?
Mr. Krabs: Try again...
Squidward: Oh! Oh! Oh! Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
Mr. Krabs: Better than that!
Squidward: ...clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
"Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?"
Squidward: No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
"SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?"
Squidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
SpongeBob: Okay!
"Squidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that!  SpongeBob, be careful with tha-   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, I've had enough..."
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose.  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya.  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, you stinking bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: Here she comes...  ...she made it!
"Mr. Krabs:  For a second or two, I thought she was a goner!"
"Squidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back.  Never, never, never, never, never!"
SpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.
"Squidward: Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!"
"Mr. Krabs:  You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious.  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip."
"SpongeBob:  Aye aye, captain!"
"Mr. Krabs: And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar."
"Squidward:  That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!"
"SpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary."
"Squidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar.  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I get ya."
"SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!  Look what we've got!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon,  and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick."
"SpongeBob:  Actually, it's Coral Blue number t-"
"Mr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this."
"Squidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore."
Mr. Krabs:  I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
Squidward: You're kidding?
SpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
Mr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich.
Squidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Mr. Krabs: Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.
"Squidward: Whatever, we've got plenty more to-  ...eat."
"Mr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!"
"Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!?"
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Just look at him!
"SpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you-"
Squidward: Look again.
SpongeBob:  You're right. How do we get outta here?
"Squidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat."
SpongeBob: Okay.
"Mr. Krabs:  So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. It's just a dumb old dollar! Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you.  Live bait."
"Squidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?"
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, he'll come."
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!  Get us out of here!"
"Mr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar...!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives.  Why couldn't it have been me?!"
"Squidward: Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!"
"SpongeBob: Why did he have to go like this, why?!"
Squidward: Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!
"Mr. Krabs: Hello, boys!"
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?
"SpongeBob: Wow, how did you get it back?"
"Mr. Krabs: It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter, so eventually, we settled on a trade."
SpongeBob: What did you give him?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing important.
"Squidward: It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home.  Quitting time!  Go home!"
"SpongeBob: Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?"
SpongeBob:  What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away.  Bleh!  But I do have to throw away the trash.
"SpongeBob:  What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books.  Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?"
"Sandy: Heck no. I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin. It's all right here in The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book Of Curiosities, Oddities, and World Records.  Look-e here, SpongeBob. Staring Record. 5 days. Most fries up nose. Holding your breath."
SpongeBob: Wow!
"Sandy: Yes siree! I swear by the power of Texas, I'm gonna break all the records in this here book!"
Sandy: What's the next challenge?
SpongeBob: Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue.
"Sandy: Well, that's easy.  106, 107..."
"SpongeBob: Hold tight, Sandy."
"Sandy: ...108, 109, 110!"
"SpongeBob: That's it, Sandy! You did it!"
Sandy: Yeehaw!
SpongeBob: Let's see... Yikes! Sweet mother of Pearl!
Sandy: Is it dangerous?
"SpongeBob: Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can."
"Sandy: Chum, huh? That's not too bad."
SpongeBob: Raw!
Sandy:  Raw?!
Plankton: You want what?
"SpongeBob: One order of chum, please."
Sandy: Raw.
"Plankton: Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!"
"SpongeBob: Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did."
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: For 30 seconds.
"Plankton: Well, it's your funeral."
"SpongeBob: Ok, Sandy, eat up."
"Sandy: Uh, SpongeBob, I changed my mummh...  Must! Make! World! Record!"
"SpongeBob: Sandy, you did it! You survived!  Uh, oh. Hold on, Sandy!  I know just what you need!  A Krabby Patty!"
Sandy: I did it! I'm alive! I can't wait to show them experts the pictures of my record breaking feats.
SpongeBob: Oh no! I forgot my camera!
Sandy: What?! SpongeBob! I need photographic proof of my amazing deeds!
SpongeBob: I'll go get the camera.
"Sandy: Well, hurry up! I got record breaking to do!"
SpongeBob: Oh my.
Sandy: Got your camera?
SpongeBob: You bet ya!
Sandy: Great! Take a picture of me chucking this last woodchuck to break the woodchuck chuckin' world record. Ready Cousin Earl?
Cousin Earl: Let er' rip darlin'!
Record Robot: 100 woodchucks chucked. Record broken!
"Sandy: Thanks for all your help, cousins!  See you all next Christmas! Bye!"
"SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy! What is all this?"
"Sandy: I've decided to go about this scientifically. I feel with careful planning an precise dedication of appropriate tasks, I can manage the successful completion of the maximum number of records broken in the least amount of time! Book! Picture!"
SpongeBob:  Here you go.
"Sandy: Thank you.  So, what's next? Oh yeah, longest tooth. So how's the calcium fusion going?"
"Robot: It is ready, Ms. Cheeks."
"Sandy: Outstanding! Here, hold this.  How'd I do?"

SpongeBob: Ouch!
Record Robot: Take a picture.

"Sandy: Ok, shoot!"
SpongeBob:  Got it! So uh how do you stop?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: I said How do you stop?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: How do you stop?
"Sandy: Why that's easy I just stop and run like heck!  Not that way!  Come on, SpongeBob! Pull yourself together! We still got a ton of records to break! Oh yeah! You're gonna love this one!"
"SpongeBob:  I don't know, Sandy. It is getting kinda dangerous."
"Sandy: Come on, you don't need your helmet. This one's outside! Follow me."
SpongeBob: Oh my.
"Sandy: There it is, the world's largest house of cards!"
SpongeBob: That's amazing! Get in front so I can take a picture.
"Sandy: Nah, let's get a shot from the top!"
"Patrick: What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown!"
Sandy: What's next?
"SpongeBob: Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox better go clean it. Now!  I think you broke a record today, Gary. World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww!  I'm worried about Sandy. She's got record-breaking fever!"
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right. She does need my help. I must stop this madness! It's all that book's fault! The book is evil! The book must be destroyed!
SpongeBob:  Why don't you take 5? I will hold the book.
Robot: Thank Neptune's gears. My wheels are killing me.
Sandy: Hey! Where do you think you're going? Get back in line. I need every available robot for this one. Most Robots built and destroyed in a day.
"Record Robot: 656, 657... Oh, the artificial humanity."
Robot:  Oh no you don't! We're all in this together!
Record Robot: 679. Record broken!
Sandy: OK shut her down!
Robot: Oh my!
Sandy: What's wrong with you?
Robot: My stomach feels funny.
"Sandy: Well, let's have a look. SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Oh hey, Sandy."
"Sandy: SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob: I came to save you from, from this book. I'm going to destroy it before someone gets killed! I don't wanna lose you, Sandy!  I don't wanna lose you!"
"Sandy: Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob. I'm done with that book! I've beat every record in here. In fact, I've been finding the author who verified my evidence."
Author: Thank you.  Yes... Oh my... well then... I'm afraid you've broken no records.
SpongeBob and Sandy: Huh?
Author: This book is 30 years old. These records were broken ages ago. You however have sent a brand new record: Most injuries sustained while helping a friend.
"Sandy: Good for you, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  Um, hurray!"
Author: Say cheese!
SpongeBob: I thought you left your swim suit at home.
"Patrick: No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg!"
SpongeBob: Rotten eggs?!
Shubie: Honey.
Nat: Huh?
"Shubie: You're not using that tan accelerator again, are you?"
"Nat: Oh, don't pretend you don't love it."
"Craig: Good work, man!  I see you've read my book."
Nat: Craig Mammalton?
Shubie: The tannest man on TV?
Craig:  None other.
"Sadie: Oh, look at those gorgeous wrinkles."
"Craig: What, these?"
"Nancy: Oh, and his skin, it's so leathery!"
"Craig: Well, I don't mean to brag, but, uh..."
SpongeBob: Who's Craig Mammalton?
"Sandals: You don't know who Craig Mammalton is? He's like, so tan! Legend has it that his tan is so deep, that even his bones are a rich caramel brown!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow!
Patrick: His mother must be so proud.
"Craig: Please, people, please. There'll be plenty of time to admire my body this weekend, at my annual summer shindig."
"SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is!"
"Craig: Can I help you, little fella?"
SpongeBob: It seems to be stuck.
"Craig: Yeah, I don't think this is your type of party. I don't want to embarrass you guys... Hey, everyone, check this out!  ...but this party is for the pig-mentally gifted."
SpongeBob: Must be this tan to enter.
"Craig: And your skin is as light and smooth as a, well, as a baby's bottom."
"SpongeBob: Why, thank you."
Patrick: We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today.
"SpongeBob: In fact,  it's time for another coat."
Patrick: We've gotta look our best.
Sandals:  Losers.
"Craig: You're not coming to my party, without a tan."
"SpongeBob: There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure."
Both: Hooray!
Patrick: Me first! Me first!
"SpongeBob: Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?"
Patrick: Like one of those hip young old folks from a soda commercial.
Old Man: It's radical!  Radical!  Drink it!
"SpongeBob: My turn!  Remember, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly."
"Patrick: Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes."
"SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working!  Okay, Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?"
Patrick: What? Did somebody say something?
"Ladies: Hey, there!"
Sally: Is that tan for us?
Patrick: What?
"SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out!"
Narrator: Two hours later...
"Millie: Do you really have to go, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Afraid so. Bye, girls."
"Ladies: Bye, Pat."
"Nazz: Oh, he's so leathery."
"SpongeBob:  Well, Patrick, how do I look?"
"Patrick:  Oh, it's you. You don't look too good."
"SpongeBob: What, what, what do you mean?"
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: I must have been under the tanning machine too long!
"Patrick: Ew, what are you going to do?"
"SpongeBob: I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do.  Hi, Squidward."
"Squidward: What is it now, Sponge--- Ghost! I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward.  I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long."
"Squidward:  Oh, this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party.  Sun Bleached!"
"SpongeBob: Huh, now I'll never get into that party."
"Patrick: Hey, that's quitter talk, mister! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover!  A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide.  What do you think?"
SpongeBob:  I look... amazing! Time to go to the party!  Oh what a cute wittle baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
Norma: Monster!
"Patrick: Well, hey, buddy, looks like you could use an ice cream."
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that hit the spot."
"Patrick:  One caramel sundae, please."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go.  Patrick, why did you..."
"Patrick: Can't talk, working."
"SpongeBob: No, really, Patrick, what are you...  Ugh. I feel sticky."
Patrick: Take a look.
"SpongeBob: Wooh!  Thanks, Patrick!  Uh, I'm stuck."
"Craig: Nice job, Ma'am. Join the party! Ahem, but the baby's going to have to wait outside."
Evelyn: But he's the perfect shade of Tropical Toddler.
"Craig: Yes, but..."
Evelyn:  Tyler! How could you?!
"Craig: Now, don't worry, Ma'am, he can wait out here, with the other rejects."
"Fish: Oh, no tears, son, we'll get in next year."
"Craig: Next.  Hey, hey, hey! Looks like you two took my advice! Nice job, gentlemen. Come on in!  All right, party people! It's time to roll out the portables."
"SpongeBob: Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here!   Patrick? Patrick?"
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Can I get a little help here?
"Patrick: Oh, sure thing, pal. Hey, everybody, make some room! The floor's all yours! Knock 'em dead, kid."
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I..."
Frankie: So bright!
"Sally: Honey, look away!"
Fred: Nice job!
"Harold: Your hideously white skin just ruined the party. I mean, look at you! Do you hug your mother with that skin?"
Tina: Can you believe this guy crashed your party? Craig?
Craig: I have seen this only one other time. It's the ultimate tan! He's...  ...Sun Bleached!
Frankie: Sun Bleached?!
"Craig: This young man... This young hero, should be praised for his dedication to tanliness.  If you guys are feeling it, we should all follow in his footsteps.  Frankie, crank it up!"
Narrator: Two hours later.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing?"
Patrick: Whatever. I just gooooo with the flow.
"Squidward:  Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab.  Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him."
"SpongeBob: Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique."
Squidward: Kelpy's not for everyone.
"D.J.: That was Kelpy G. Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean. Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out."
"SpongeBob: Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are…  sorry, sold out."
"Squidward: Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?"
SpongeBob: You forgot to buy a ticket?
"Squidward: Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there.  Oh wait, I just realized... I'll be having the greatest time of my life!"
"SpongeBob: Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?"
"Squidward: Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it!"
SpongeBob: You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.
D.J.: This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonight’s concert. We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller.
"Squidward: Oh, the dream is still alive!"
"D.J.: Hey, you are lucky loser number one. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number five. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number nine. Please, try again. Twenty-two. Try again. Twenty-seven. Sixty-five."
"Squidward: Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam."
D.J.: Hello! You're winning caller number 102.
SpongeBob: I am?
"D.J.: Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself."
"SpongeBob: Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be."
"SpongeBob: Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G!"
"Squidward: Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits."
Female Fan #1: You can say that again. It's a rare treat to mingle with true diehard smooth jazzists.
"SpongeBob: You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!"
Male Fan #1: Was it you who brought the raucous miscreant?
Squidward: Me? No. Of course not. No.
Squidward: See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.
Female Fan #1: Just keep your friends outbursts under control.
"SpongeBob: Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir."
Male Fan #2: What wig?
"Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip."
"SpongeBob: Whoa, just look at that lemonade line."
"Squidward: That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade."
SpongeBob: Yeah.
"Squidward: I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade."
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: It's right behind you SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh! Why don't I get one for you?
"Squidward: Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—"
"Squidward: Well, okay, if you insist."
"SpongeBob: Alright. One lemonade, coming up."
"Squidward:  See you after the show, Spongee-G."
"Squidward:  Ah, Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance. I just love this tune."
"Male Fan #3: Hey hey, a fellow mellow jazz-dazzler. What's happening?"
Squidward: Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.
Male Fan #3: I'm picking up what you're laying down. You can groove with us any time.
Squidward: Don't mind if I do groove.
SpongeBob:  Look what I found!
Squidward: What the…? What?
SpongeBob: Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand!
"SpongeBob: Hey, nice tune.  Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?"
"Male Fan #3: Kazoo? Your friend knows absolutely nothing of Kelpy G, man!"
SpongeBob: Are you friends with Squidward?
Male Fan #3: Friends? I should think not. We only associate with true jazz-dazzlers.
Squidward: But I dazzle. Oh.
"SpongeBob: Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people."
"Squidward: Oh, boy."
"Female Fan #2: Hey, Sponge! Would you just sit down and shut your mouth?"
"Male Fan #4: Well, thank you for speaking up."
"Announcer: Hello, all you snazzy jazzlers. Please put your thumbs and forefingers together and give a warm welcome to the pied piper of jazz himself— Kelpy G."
Male Fan #5: Bravo! Bravo! It's so exciting!
SpongeBob: Wow!
Squidward: Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.
"Patrick:  Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup?"
Squidward: No I don't — ketchup?
"SpongeBob: Patrick, what brought you here?"
"Patrick: Two words, SpongeBob— na chos."
"Squidward: Two words, Patrick— get lost."
Patrick:  What's that?
"Squidward: Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa— huh?"
"SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa—"
Patrick: Tummy want more.
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy."
Squidward:  I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half.  What the...?
"Patrick:  I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes.  Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now."
Security Fish #1: Get 'im!
Male Fan #6: You're so light.
"Squidward: Hey, come back here with those backstage passes."
Crew Member: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where do you think you're going?
Squidward: But our friend just took our—
"Crew Member: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about the whosits or the whatsits. Clear the aisle and go back to your seat."
"Squidward: Oh, well, at least we still have our seats."
"Big Squid: You got a problem, tentacle head?"
"Squidward: Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya?  You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this—  Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G."
"Patrick: Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub."
"Squidward: We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G."
"Milo J. Fingerfish: Hey, this is a private area. Only people with backstage passes can come back here."
"SpongeBob: Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience."
Milo J. Fingerfish: What are you talking about? I'm Kelpy G's manager. Now read my lips.
"Squidward: No backstage passes, no entry."
"Milo J. Fingerfish: And no seeing Kelpy G, got it?"
"Squidward: Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!"
"Milo J Fingerfish: Get up, man. Have some dignity."
"Squidward: But, but, but… what if I told you, uh… I'm a clarinet player myself.  I call this one, Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars. Wait. Hold for it."
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh!
"Crew Member: Right this way, Mr. G."
"Kelpy G: Another show, another intermission."
"Crew Member: Your dressing room is right over here, sir."
Kelpy G: Hold on a smooth second.
Crew Member: Who let those two back here? That sounds horrible. I'll get 'im right out.
"Kelpy G: No, no. I agree. The clarinet sound abysmal, but that ukulele. Genius. And his clogs. They're just like mine, see? Excuse me, young man."
"Squidward: Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet—"
Kelpy G: And what might you be called?
SpongeBob: SpongeBob SquarePants.
"Kelpy G: Come, young protege, let us woo the crowd with sounds of heavenly delight.  At this time, I'd like to welcome a very special guest to the stage — Mr. SpongeBob SmoothPants."
"Squidward: This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy.  But I'm a musician!"
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Hey.
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Squidward: I'm busy.
SpongeBob: How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?
Squidward:  Fourteen!
"SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!"
Squidward:  It is!
"SpongeBob: Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?"
Squidward: What's busy busy?
"Squidward: No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!"
SpongeBob:  I found a jump rope!
Squidward:  I said not to tell me!  You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.
SpongeBob: Oh! Who's the lucky...
Squidward:  Perfectly brown toast points.   Sparkling kelp juice.   Here's to me!  D'oh! That simpering buffoon!
Squidward's reflection In glass: You have a great vocabulary.
Squidward: I know.
Squidward's reflection: Indubitably.
Squidward:  Go away!
Norton: Okay.
Squidward: Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.
Norton: No. I guess I'm just this idiot.
"Norton: Why, it's beautiful."
"Squidward: You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria. Oh, I've heard of that! Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--  --Squidward Tentacles...  ...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"
"Norton: Ah, it's a plus one."
Squidward: Ahh! What are you still doing here?
Norton: It's not ploos oh-nay. It says plus one!
"Squidward: Plus one! Oh, yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?"
"Norton: Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes, they put plus one on it to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend."
Squidward: Do you have to do it?
"Norton: Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser."
Squidward: What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?
Squidward's reflection: You need to find a friend to take as your plus one.
SpongeBob:  Somebody like me?
SpongeBob: I like openings.
"Squidward: No, not like you!"
"SpongeBob: Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me."
Squidward: Let's see here. Friends...
"Squidward:  Friends, friends..."
"Squidward: Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  ...tonight?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?"
"Squidward: But, of course! It's so simple."
"Squidward: SpongeBob, I have something to ask you."
SpongeBob: Of course I'll go to the opening with you!
Squidward: That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?
"SpongeBob: Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went..."
"Norton: And then you just initial there, and we're all set."
"Squidward: Hey, there you are!"
Norton: Not in the face!
"Squidward: What? What are you... Oh!  You always were a big kidder, huh?  Mailman  guy?"
"Norton: Actually, I'm not a kidder. I'm much more of an introvert."
"Squidward: I love introverts! Why, I'm an introvert!"
Norton: You are?
"Squidward: Say, I bet we have a lot in common."
"Norton:  Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries."
Squidward: That's me!
Norton: And eating delicious food.
"Squidward: Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can..."
Both: Spread on a toast point!
"Squidward: Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind."
"Norton: Right? And if there's one thing I hate, it's..."
Squidward:  SpongeBob!
Norton:  Clarinets!
"Squidward: Yeah, I know it... What?"
"Norton: I mean, what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky, hollow, kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hard with nothing to lose could pick up a  clarinet and think Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!  Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh."
"Norton: Buddy?  Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!"
"Widow Duncan: Oh, Norton! I've always taken a shine to you."
"Squidward: Oh, you think you know a guy?  Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend."
SpongeBob:  I'll be your friend.
Squidward:  Who is this?
"SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob."
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes? I'm still here.
Squidward: I need to ask you something important.
SpongeBob: You don't have to ask me three times.
Squidward: Will you tell Larry I want to talk to him?
SpongeBob: Oh.
SpongeBob: Okey-doke.
"Larry: So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?"
"Squidward: Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words."
"Larry: Oh, I've been there, amigo."
Squidward: You have?
Larry: Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.
Larry: Ever been on one of these little babies?
"Squidward: Um, no. The.. they always seemed a little sporty for me."
"Larry: Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet."
Squidward: What the heck?
Unnamed fish: Hey!
Squidward: We make quite a team!
Larry: I'll say!
"Squidward: You know, earlier today, I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music."
"Larry: Hey, you know, that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?"
"Squidward: You know, you're alright, Lester."
Larry: It's Larry.
"Squidward: Whatever. The point is, do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?"
"Larry: Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but... for you, sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake."
Squidward: What?! You don't need that glop!
"Larry: Oh, I wouldn't call it glop. Protein shake saved my life, bro."
"Squidward: Oh, come on. It's a fad. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."
Squidward:  I mean...
"Squidward: So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?"
Squidward:  I guess it's just you and me again.
Squidward:  What are you doing here?
SpongeBob:  Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
Squidward: No.
"SpongeBob: You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you, like this. Wanna play?"
Squidward: Just get me out of here!
SpongeBob:  Will do.
Squidward: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Anything for a friend.
Squidward: Friend?
Squidward: Would you be my plus one?
"Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob."
Perch Perkins: And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!
Squidward's reflection: You'll always be my plus one!
Squidward: Aww!
Narrator: Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff. This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.
"Mrs. Puff: Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts."
Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
Mrs. Puff: And a driver without boat smarts.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!"
"Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure.  Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level.  While this driver pays no need to boat smarts.  Buckling Up.  As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision.  Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign.  Now this driver, with no regard for safety.  Well, at least he had his seat belt on.  Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now?  You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater."
"SpongeBob: Ah, perfect."
"Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool!"
"SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet."
Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow.
"Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road.  And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety."
Norma:  Jerk!
SpongeBob: Hi there!
Nat: Help! Lunatic driver!
SpongeBob: How's it going?
Fish:  I can't feel my hair. My leg!
"Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law."
"SpongeBob: Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff."
SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!
Mrs. Puff: Never mind.
"SpongeBob: Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?"
Patrick: It's cutting into my early morning nature nap.
"SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!"
Patrick: Okay!
Both: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Cool ice cave!
Patrick: Ohhhhhhh...  This whole place is a frozen treat!
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!"
Patrick: Uh. Now he tells me.
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic."
"Patrick: I panicked, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob: Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything.
Patrick:  Hot! Hot! Hot!  Hot! Agh!
Spongy Spongy: Uh...?
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today."
"Spongy Spongy: Oh? Ah.  Squeaky, squeaky!"
Spongy Spongy:  Mehh.
"SpongeBob: See ya later, Patrick.  Gary, I'm home!  Boy, this backpack got heavy."
Gary: Meow!
Gary: Meow.
Spongy Spongy: Ah!
"SpongeBob: Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue."
Spongy Spongy: Agh-agh-agh!
Spongy Spongy:  Squeaky! Squeaky!
Spongy Spongy:  No squeaky.
"SpongeBob: I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight!"
Gary: Meow?
Spongy Spongy:  Squeaky! Squeaky!
SpongeBob:  Ah!
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!"
Squidward: It was.  Agh!
SpongeBob: I do relish...  making the relish!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?! You called me?"
"Mr. Krabs: Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?"
"SpongeBob:  Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir!"
"Ivy: That's the man who smashed my mailbox, officer!"
Mr. Krabs: Well?
"SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!"
"Mr. Krabs: Of course you wouldn't! It's just this loser's word against yours, boy-o. They can't convict you for that."
SpongeBob: Phew.
Evelyn: He ruined my fountain!
"Cara: Yeah, yeah! That's the guy!"
"Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Mr. SquarePants, I'm afraid you're under arrest."
"SpongeBob: But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me!"
"Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy-o! I'm right behind you!  Look alive, Mr. Squidward!  I'm gonna visit SpongeBob in the big house. You are manning the grill!"
Squidward:  Ow!
Spongy Spongy: Ah?  Agh!
"Squidward: They let you out already? Ugh, you look terrible, SpongeBob!  Well, get the food ready. It's almost time for lunch!"
Spongy Spongy: Food?
Spongy Spongy: Agh!
"Squidward: Well, it's about time!"
Customers: This is ridiculous! Is this a restaurant or a garage?
Spongy Spongy: Huh?
"Squidward: SpongeBob, what did you do? The patties taste horrible! Everybody hates them!"
Spongy Spongy: Unh...
Squidward: What the—  SpongeBob's gone crazy! Run for your lives!
Spongy Spongy:  Spongy! Spongy!
"Perch Perkins: This is Perch Perkins live at the Krusty Krab, where we understand that a local fry cook has just gone nuts."
Perch Perkins:  Ooh! This just in... Ow!
"Mr. Krabs: Why did you have to go nuts on company time, boy-o? I'm gonna lose so much money."
"SpongeBob: I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent!"
"Spongy Spongy: Oh? Squeaky, squeaky?"
"Mr. Krabs: Save it for the judge, boy-o. Come clean! Nobody else even looks like you!"
Mr. Krabs: Except that guy.
"Spongy Spongy:  Squeaky, squeaky! Squeaky, squeaky!"
"Perch Perkins: Local scientists now believe that the rampaging fry cook is actually a prehistoric cave sponge, once thought to be extinct."
Officer Rob Johnson: Ah! Get him off!
SpongeBob: See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!
SpongeBob: Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to.
"Perch Perkins: Shortly thereafter, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob went to City Hall to confront the wild beast."
Mr. Krabs: We did?
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me."
Spongy Spongy: Unh?
SpongeBob: Ooh?  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!
Spongy Spongy: Unh. Spongy Spongy.
SpongeBob: Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Hello!
"SpongeBob: Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone."
"Spongy Spongy:  Uh.  Oh! Squeaky, squeaky!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, you like that, huh?  Ah!"
"SpongeBob: Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!"
"SpongeBob: Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!"
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Nobody's gonna put him in jail son. He just saved the town millions by demolishing City Hall. It was due to come down next week.
SpongeBob: Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!
Spongy Spongy:  Spongy Spongy. Spongy Spongy!
"Perch Perkins: And so, the savage beast finally soothed, life in Bikini Bottom returns to normal...if only for this episode. This is Perch Perkins— Ow!  For Bikini Bottom News."
"Patrick: Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here."
Patrick:  How about now?
"SpongeBob:  Right by my side.  Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other.  Let's get them, Patrick."
Shubie: Can I help you boys?
"SpongeBob: I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?"
Patrick: You...found a new best friend.
"SpongeBob: Oh, what are you...  Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, look out, behind you!!"
"Nazz: Excuse me, but does this come in..."
Patrick: Noooo! You're not my best friend!
SpongeBob: We’ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals!
"SpongeBob: We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat."
Patrick: You mean like those guys?
"SpongeBob: Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement."
Patrick: Look at these guys!
"SpongeBob: Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?"
"Bill: Oh, no, these aren't my friends. In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historical battles is so great, I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom."
SpongeBob: There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?
"Patrick: Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies"
Nathiel Waters: Clean as a whistle!
Patrick: And those who had more important things to do with their time.
Colonial Patrick: That looks good to me.
Nathiel: That is truly disgusting!
"Colonial Patrick:  Oh, yeah?"
Nathiel: You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!
"Colonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?!"
Nathiel: Yes!
Red Group: Wash your hands!
Blue Group: Never!
Patrick: And that's how we won our right to wash as we please.
"Bill:  Oh, that's not what happened."
"SpongeBob:  You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!"
"Patrick: Never have, never will."
SpongeBob: Echhh!
"Patrick: Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone."
"SpongeBob: That's okay. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, I said..."
"Patrick:  Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue."
SpongeBob: Really?
"Patrick: Here, I'll get it."
"SpongeBob: Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me."
"Patrick: Well, then I guess we can't be friends."
SpongeBob: What are you saying?
"Patrick: Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U... R... huh... How do you spell not my friend?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you."
"Patrick: No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs."
SpongeBob: But being clean is so much better.
"Patrick: Well, says you. I like dirty."
SpongeBob: Clean!
Patrick: Dirty!
SpongeBob: Clean!
"Harold: Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact."
"SpongeBob: Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!"
"Patrick:  Fine, me too!"
"Harold: Ah, come on! Let's go play somewhere else."
SpongeBob: Ha! Got your nose!
"Patrick: Hey, give it back!"
SpongeBob: Not until you wash your hands!
"Patrick: Oh, yeah? Well  I got your eyeballs!"
"SpongeBob:  Eww, brain juice!"
Patrick:  Do you give up yet?
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me."
Patrick: Your pants are falling down.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: I'll fix it.
SpongeBob: Satisfied?
"Patrick: There, you look good now."
"SpongeBob: You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet."
"Patrick: Why, what's wrong with them?"
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
"Patrick: No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!"
"SpongeBob: You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!"
"Patrick: Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?"
"SpongeBob: A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  You got to brush in little circles!"
"Patrick:  Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!!"
"SpongeBob: You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this!"
"Patrick: No! No, not...not deodorant!"
"Patrick:  My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose."
"Patrick: Oh, yeah?"
"SpongeBob:  Booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!"
Mr. Krabs: Gold? Heehee!
Squidward: Did you get any of Patrick's gold?
Mr. Krabs: He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.
Patrick: Ha! I got you now!
"SpongeBob:  Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon!"
Patrick:  Raw onions?!  That does it!  See this?
"SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty? What are you going to do, eat it?"
"Patrick: Oh, I'm not going to eat it."
"SpongeBob: No, not patty socks!"
"Patrick: That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!"
SpongeBob: You better stop that!
"Patrick:  Stinky, little feet!"
SpongeBob:  You stop that right now!
"Patrick: Hopping...  ...Clams!  Hey, I got my filth back!"
"SpongeBob: Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!"
"Patrick:  No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!"
SpongeBob: Try me!
"Patrick:  Stay back, I'll do it!"
SpongeBob: It's too late for that!
Patrick:  My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!
SpongeBob:  I'm covered in muck and scum!
"Patrick: Man, to get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!"
SpongeBob: It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!
Patrick: Slather toe jam on my armpits?
SpongeBob: I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!
Patrick: Smear slime on my teeth?
SpongeBob: And dry-clean my uvula!
Both: All right!
"SpongeBob: Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean."
"Patrick: And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick, thank you."
Both:  You're my best friend ever!
"Bill: Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner."
"SpongeBob:  Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?"
"Patrick: Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky."
"SpongeBob:  Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth."
Bill: Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.
"SpongeBob: And what is that, my son?"
"Bill: That re-enacting battles is really lame!  Come on, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!"
Harold: Or hockey!
Thaddeus: Or knitting fluffy sweaters!
"SpongeBob: Come, Patrick, my work here is done."
"Customer: One monster Krabby Patty, please."
"Squidward: Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob:  Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
"Squidward: Uh, One monster Krabby Patty."
Mr. Krabs: HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customers: Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customer #2:  Monster Krabby Patty?!
"SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune."
"Squidward: Oh, boy."
"SpongeBob:  We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?"
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, we better get back to work."
SpongeBob: Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
Mr. Krabs: Use another spatula'r.
"SpongeBob:  WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming, Spat!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together."
"Doctor: There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula."
Doctor: Go home. Get some rest. We'll try to do everything we can.
"SpongeBob: Thank you, Doctor."
"Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who's searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part."
SpongeBob:  Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!
SpongeBob:  Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.
Doctor:  I would give serious consideration to...  a replacement spatula.
SpongeBob: OW!
"Employee: Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive."
SpongeBob: I'm sorry.
"Employee: Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it."
"SpongeBob: I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?"
Employee: Umm...  ...no.
SpongeBob:  How about now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob:  Now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob:  Now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob:  That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
"Employee: Everything, huh?  Nice outfit."
"SpongeBob: Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking?  Ooh, breezy today."
"Squidward:  Nice outfit, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny."
Mr. Krabs: What's all the lallygagging about?
"Squidward:  Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob."
Mr. Krabs: This better be good.
"SpongeBob: Soon, everyone will know of your beauty."
"Mr. Krabs: Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?"
"SpongeBob: All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?
"SpongeBob: Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, what can it do?"
Squidward: Can it make me famous?
SpongeBob: Anything you want and more.
"Mr. Krabs: Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do."
Mr. Krabs:  What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
"SpongeBob: No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master."
"Mr. Krabs: With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact..."
Le Spatula:  Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
"Mr. Krabs: Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket."
"SpongeBob: Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job."
"Wobbles: Uh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?"
"Squidward: SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty."
"SpongeBob:  One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?"
"Le Spatula: I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!"
"SpongeBob: But, but, I thought we were friends."
"Le Spatula: Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class.  Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook!"
"SpongeBob: Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something."
"Le Spatula: How's that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon."
Mr. Krabs: What happened?
"SpongeBob: Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr Krabs: Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!"
"SpongeBob: I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!"
Mr. Krabs: I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
"SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula."
"Mr. Krabs: Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers."
SpongeBob: Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late!
"Doctor: SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this..."
SpongeBob: I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone!
"Doctor: Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so sorry."
"Doctor: Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary."
"SpongeBob:  Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?!"
SpongeBob: &#160;: All that glitters is not gold.
"SpongeBob: Goodbye, best friend!"
"SpongeBob: I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us."
Squidward: One monster Krabby Patty.
"SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh!"
Patrick:  You see him?
"SpongeBob: Nope.  Oh, wait, now I do."
Patrick:  What's he doing?
"SpongeBob: Um, just kinda sitting there."
Patrick: How about now?
"SpongeBob: Still just like kinda sitting there, same thing."
Patrick: How long have we been watching?
SpongeBob: What time is it now?
Patrick: 2:30.
SpongeBob:  4 days.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, it's moving!"
Patrick: Ready to go for it?
"SpongeBob: Like Mr. Krabs says, it's now or never!"
Patrick: When does he say that?
SpongeBob: Usually on his way to the Men's room. Bunsai!
"Patrick: Hey, that's usually what I say!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, he's taking evasive action."
Patrick: We better fake him.
"SpongeBob: I'll fake left, you go right!"
Patrick: Roger that!
"SpongeBob: Other right, Patrick!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"SpongeBob: Ow, I think I ruptured a spleen..."
Patrick: I think I shattered my abacus.
SpongeBob: Your what?
Patrick: My abacus.  Nope. Seems okay...
SpongeBob: Patrick! There it goes!
"SpongeBob: Don't stop now, Patrick, we're gaining on him!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"Cletus:  Well, it's now or never."
SpongeBob: Ehhh.
"Trenchbilly: You boys are mighty colorful, a smidget too colorful, if ya' ask me."
"Cletus:  And too darn heavy, if ya' ask me."
"SpongeBob: Well, actually Patrick has been trying to shed a few-"
Cletus: Tell it to Ma Angler...
Trenchbillies:
"Ma Angler: Now tell me there, what was it y'alls was doin' down yonder at the outhouse in the first place?"
"Cletus: I dun told ya', Ma, thar I was doin' my duty, just like any other Sunday..."
"Cletus:  Well, it's now or never...  When not so much as a warning shout, these here varmints dun dropped, right out of the wild, black yonder, smack-dab onto my noggin! Darn there givin' me a crik in the neck it has to."
SpongeBob: We're really sorry about interrupting your-
Jordan Klein: Y'all hush up!
"Ma Angler: Now Cletus, is this another one of your tall tales, you tend to tell?"
"Cletus: I-I-I swears I ain't fibbin', Ma!"
Ma Angler: Cletus.
Cletus: Just ask Uncle Belcher. He'll tell you the whole story.
Uncle Belcher:
Cletus: See.
"Ma Angler: Well, I must admit one thing, they is awfully perty... Nevertheless, as leader of this here clan, which I is, I must subject these two pretty folks, to clan initiation rights to deem their worthy."
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: Worthy of what?
SpongeBob: ...specifically.
Ma Angler: Of livin'...  Theether! Go on and get your fiddle.
"SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! He's gonna play us a little song."
SpongeBob: Short song.
"Patrick: SpongeBob, I think this is meant to be a-a musical challenge."
"SpongeBob: Challenge? ] Patrick, we don't even have an instrument to play."
"Patrick: Yeah, and soon we won't have anything to play it with..."
SpongeBob: Huh! Patrick! Hang on...
"Patrick: SpongeBob, don't leave me!"
"SpongeBob: Wouldn't dream of it, Patrick."
Patrick: Alright!
"SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, even though you won, it looks like he was the real star. Hahaha."
Ma Angler: Betsy!
Betsy: Yes'um?
Ma Angler: It's time for a hootin' and hollarin' contest.
Betsy:
"SpongeBob: Patrick, it's a singing competition. What are we gonna do?"
"Patrick: I don't know, but I am a sure thirsty after that fiddlin'."
"SpongeBob: Hey, give me some of that!"
Trenchbillies: Yee-haww!
"SpongeBob: Looks like we're on a roll, eh, Patrick?"
Ma Angler: I just love me some wrastlin' and tusslin'!
Patrick: Let me see more.
SpongeBob: My compliments to the chef.
Cletus:  Your turn.
"SpongeBob: Hah! Well, actually, my friend and I, we don't like to wrestle."
Ma Angler: Huh? You don't like to wrastle?
"SpongeBob: No, we're not the wrestling sort."
"Ma Angler: Well, then, what in tarnation do you pretty folks like to do for fun?"
"SpongeBob: Well, uh-uh, we like to go jellyfishing!"
Ma Angler: Jellyfishin'. What kinda tomfoolery is jellyfishin'?
"SpongeBob: Well, it goes something like this:"
Cletus: What-the?
Ma Angler: That's disgustin'.
"SpongeBob: Now, Patrick!  Well, something like that anyway..."
"Patrick: Nice knowing you, buddy..."
"Ma Angler: Well, I haven't seen anybody cut up like that 'round these parts since we was potty-trained Junior.  He was near about 13!"
Cletus: Them boys is dumber than my box a' rotten teeth!
Cletus: Go get em' tiger!
Jordan Klein:  They grow up so fast.
"Ma Angler: As leader of this here clan, I heareby debut: Sponge-Joe-Bob and Deral, honorary trenchbillies."
Cletus: Speech! Speech!
"SpongeBob: Well, I guess if I were to say one thing, and I think I'm speaking for Patrick and myself here, is that y'all are a bunch a' real kind folks and it's been a real hoot gettin' to know y'all!  Farewall, friendly trenchbillies. See ya' 'round."
Patrick: Toodles.
Cletus:  And where do you folk think you're goin'?
SpongeBob: Over to home.
"Cletus: Well, you're one of our kin' now, so this is your home, and as such, you've been givin' the great honor of takin' care a' Ma, for the rest of your natural-born lives."
Patrick: Takin' care a' Ma?!
SpongeBob: For the rest of our natural-born lives?!
"Cletus: You know, carry her purse, give her cat massages, read her the Willy Shakespeare ‘til she falls asleep at night. Ah, Ma just loves Iambic pentameter!"
"SpongeBob: Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!"
"Patrick: Yeah, and, iambic pentameter gives me a headache!"
Cletus:  You folks ain't goin' nowhere.
"SpongeBob: Oh please, Mr. Trenchbillie, where can we-"
"Patrick: Oh, hey, your shoe's untied."
Cletus: What? But I ain't even wearin'- Darn it.
"Mr. Krabs: Well, what was I supposed to tell them, Squidward?"
Squidward: You could have told him that he could have his money back.
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, no I couldn't."
Squidward: Why?
"Mr. Krabs: Because, I already put it in the register!"
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! We just escaped from an angry mob of deep sea bunkins!
Patrick: It was horrible! They were gonna make us stay forever and massage their grandma.
Mr. Krabs:  So. Why ya' telling me?
SpongeBob: Because they followed us here.
Cletus: Come on out! We know you're in thar!
Mr. Krabs:  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
"Cletus: Umm, sure. I'll have me a large Krabby Patty with uhh...a cola, no, no! Lemon-lime! )"
"Mr. Krabs: Keep them coming, SpongeBob! This is the most business in a long time!"
"SpongeBob: Aye', captain! I'm gonna get some more buns."
Ma Angler: More! More! More! More!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah, that's what I like to see. She's gonna make customer of the week."
"Cletus:  We catch anyone makin' goo-goo eyes like that at our Ma, it can only mean one thing: He's gonna get hitched!"
Mr. Krabs:   Noooooo!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and others wave hands. The heart animation appears when the episode ends."
"Patchy: Merry Christmas, kids! I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck. Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter. So I gave Mr. Mailman the day off."
Potty: Do you even know how to get to the North Pole?
"Patchy: Oh, Potty, you silly parrot. Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song Jingle Bells. ♪Dashing through the snow, in a...  Through the fields we go. La la la la la.♪ Okay. So we're looking for some fields here."
"Potty: No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, There Goes Santa Claus. ♪There goes Santa Claus. There goes Santa Claus. Left on Santa Claus Drive.♪ Scurvy brain."
"Patchy: Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields."
Potty: Look out! There's a fork in the road!
Patchy: I don't see no fork.
"Patchy: While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas."
"SpongeBob: ♪Oh, it's drawing very near. My favorite time of the year.  The snow is falling and the cold wind blows.  Christmas is almost here.  And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me!  It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little...  Eyes on me.♪"
"SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today?"
"Squidward: Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms...  ...to go away!"
"SpongeBob: Okay...  ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!♪  Ooh, what's that?"
Patrick: It's a trap! A trap for Santa!
SpongeBob: Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats?
"Patrick:  ♪I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And we'll have Christmas all year long!♪ Hey, a cookie!"
"SpongeBob: ♪Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee!  And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?♪"
"Sandy: ♪Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas is sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.♪"
"SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, Sandy!"
"Sandy: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me.♪ Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas?"
"Mr. Krabs: Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'!"
SpongeBob: Don't you mean the season of giving?
"Mr. Krabs: Exactly! The more you give, the more I get."
"Plankton: ♪Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!♪"
Karen: Maybe you'd get a real present from Santa if you weren't the biggest jerk in Bikini Bottom.
"Plankton: I'm way ahead of you, Karen!  There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold!  Jerktonium!  I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all holiday goodies. The fruitcake! And each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll finally get what I really want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula!  And now for the main ingredient, Jerktonium! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete!  Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling out tainted fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim?"
"SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton! What've you got there?  Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya?"
"Plankton: Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go!"
Plankton: Hot from the oven and full in lovin'!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot!  Wow! This is great!
"Plankton: So, how do you feel, kinda cranky?"
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Sorta surly?
SpongeBob: Mm-mm.
Plankton: Maybe just a little bit jerky?
SpongeBob: No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious!
Plankton: Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Try some more.
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do!
Plankton: How's your dander? Is it up?
SpongeBob: No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer?
"Taste Bud: Oh, boy, here comes some more! Yaaaay!"
Plankton: Grrr! Have some more!  Have a whole loaf!  Have a baker's dozen!  Well?
SpongeBob: Well...  I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!
"Plankton: You know what? Knock yourself out.  Stupid hunk of junk-tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy."
"SpongeBob:  Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat?"
"Bill: Why, sure, SpongeBob!"
"Fish 2: Yeah, who doesn't like treats?"
SpongeBob:  Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in!
Fish 2: It's like a present for my mouth!
SpongeBob: I knew you'd like it.
Bill:  Hey! Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake?
"Fish 2: Whoa, calm down, Bill! What do you want to sing?"
"Bill: Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's “Jingle Bells”. From the top! A one and a two and a –"
"Fish 3:  No, hold your holly! We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's “Silver Bells”!"
"Bill: Wrong bells, buddy!"
"Fish 2:  Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”!"
SpongeBob:  Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
Plankton:  What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
"SpongeBob: Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy.  Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”!"
Bikini Bottomites: Yay!
"SpongeBob: Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché.  Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!"
Plankton:  This just keeps getting better and better.
"Costumed Santa:  Ho ho ho! So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas?"
Boy: I want a sled and a truck and a bike and a train ...
"SpongeBob: Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake."
"Boy: And a water pistol and a helicopter and – and, uh ..."
"Costumed Santa:  Well, why don't you get a job and buy all that junk yourself? And while you're at it try brushing your teeth, you little -"
SpongeBob: Have some fruitcake!
Driver: Thanks!  That's it! I'm outta here!
"Boy:  Whee-ee-ee! Oh, yeah. And I want a trampoline!"
Plankton: Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
Karen: Once again your master plan is fatally flawed.  It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium.
SpongeBob Diagram: Dahahaha! That tickles.
"Plankton: Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B.  Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name!  Huh? Oh yeah."
"ToyBob: I am ready, I am ready, I am ready. Ready to destroy Christmas."
"Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob."
"Plankton: Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!"
"Patchy: I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch.  Ow!  Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?"
"Patchy:  Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes.  Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty?  With a side of blue cheese dressing."
Potty: Squawk! What are you doing?
"Patchy: I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!"
"Potty: It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you."
Patchy: Aww.
"Patchy: Why are you looking at me like that, bird?  What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, fellas!"
"Bill: Ah, go stuff a stocking!"
"SpongeBob: Gee. That wasn't very nice.  Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!"
"SpongeBob: What's that all about?  Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?"
"Patrick: I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob!  I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now."
"SpongeBob: Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters."
"Patrick: Nosybody.  Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp."
"SpongeBob: Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will."
"Johnny: Merry Christmas, Frankie."
"Frankie: Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny."
"SpongeBob: More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help.  Squidward!"
Squidward:  I'm not home!
"SpongeBob: Oh gosh, what do I do now?"
Squidward: Why don't you go bother Sandy?
"SpongeBob: Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home."
"Squidward: I said I'm not home!  SpongeBob, give me back my door!"
"SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why."
Sandy:  Why should I help all them jerks?
"SpongeBob: Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem."
Sandy: Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts.
"SpongeBob: Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!"
"Sandy: Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer!  Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake!  This is terrible!"
"SpongeBob: What is it, Sandy?"
"Sandy: The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?"
"SpongeBob: From Plankton, he baked it."
Sandy: You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Sandy: You're an idiot.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Sandy: No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.
SpongeBob: Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
"Sandy:  Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason, it's not affecting you.  It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula.  Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!"
"SpongeBob: Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song!  Sandy, The song is the antidote!"
Fish 6: Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat!
"SpongeBob: Ahoy, everybody!"
"SpongeBob: ♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!  Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas! When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪"
"SpongeBob's Friends and Co.:  ♪Jolly, not jerky!♪"
"SpongeBob: ♪Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!♪"
"Sandy: Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked!"
SpongeBob: And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute.
Mr. Krabs: You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!"
"Santa: Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings."
"SpongeBob: Oh, no!"
"Santa: Oh, yes. It seems you're all on my naughty list this year."
SpongeBob: Naughty list?!
Santa: No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks.
SpongeBob: But---!
Santa: But nothing. Coal for everyone! Except Plankton.
"SpongeBob, Friends and Co.: Wha-a-at!"
"Santa: I'm just as surprised as you, but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint.   Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for."
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula? How did you get that?
Santa: I have my ways.
Pearl: Um... Dad?
"Mr. Krabs: Huh?  Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!"
"SpongeBob: But- but- but- but- but- but---!  But, Santa, you've got it all wrong!"
"Santa: On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now—wreaking havoc!"
Plankton: Uh-oh.
ToyBob:  I am ready to destroy Christmas.  Destroy Santa.
"SpongeBob: If you want Santa, you gotta get through me!"
Mega ToyBob: Okey-dokey.
"Santa: Oh, my."
SpongeBob: Is that all you got?
"Santa: I'm outta here.  You do realize this counts as, naughty."
"SpongeBob: You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter!  Hot from the oven, full of lovin'!  Hurry up, Santa, hop on!"
Santa: Thanks again for saving my keister.
"SpongeBob: Oh, it was nothing."
"Santa: You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity.  What have we got there? If found, please return to the Chum Bucket? Plankton?!"
Plankton: Uh-oh.
"Mr. Krabs: Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse."
"Santa: O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves.  So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!  waves goodbye to him]"
"SpongeBob: Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?"
Patrick:   Hee hee hee hee. I gotcha!
"Patchy:  Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here!"
Potty: I'm not going in there.
"Patchy: Santa!  There's only thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants."
"Santa: I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty. Wouldn't you say, Potty?"
"Potty: I sure would, Santa."
Both: Merry Christmas.
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
TV Announcer: Wow! It's the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show!
"Patrick: It's cartoon time, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SpongeRobert?"
SpongeBob: Oh! It's cartoon time! I'll get our Sir Urchin hats.  Whoa.
"Patrick: Not so fast, SpongeBob. What's in the secret room?"
"SpongeBob: It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library."
Patrick: W-what's that word mean?
SpongeBob: A library is a...playground for your mind.
Patrick:  Let's do it! It's library time!
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: Ow! Ow!
Snail Fail: What I do?
"SpongeBob:  Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?"
"Patrick: Oh, I love books!  Book! Book!  Book!"
"SpongeBob:  Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly.  Ow!  Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell."
Patrick: Whoa.
"SpongeBob: Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous."
Patrick: I'll save you!  Whoa!
"SpongeBob:  There are logbooks,  unabridged books,  and books with bridges."
Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob:  Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks.  I can hear the ocean.
Patrick: Me too!
"SpongeBob: Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious."
Patrick: I like the pictures.
"SpongeBob:  Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack!  It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book.  Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick."
"Patrick: Oh, read the—oh, uh...Once...Upon a... Once upon a... Once upon a what?!"
"SpongeBob: To continue the story, you have to turn the page."
Patrick: Oh. Time. Once upon a time!  That's the most amazing trick I've ever seen! I want to stare at more words!
SpongeBob: Then feast your eyes!
Patrick: Once upon a time...
Patrick:  Once a— You're too slow!
"SpongeBob: He likes it! Hey, Patrick!"
"SpongeBob: Ooh, Patrick, your head is absorbing all the book knowledge just like a sponge!"
"SpongeBob:  Go, Patrick! Get those words! Get them good!"
Patrick: Stop reading words!
"SpongeBob: Wow, what a bookworm!  Whoa."
"Patrick: Yes, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full."
"Patrick: Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information.  Ahem."
"SpongeBob: Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream."
"Patrick: Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!"
"Patrick: Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?"
"SpongeBob: Eh, wha what?"
"Patrick:  Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first."
SpongeBob: I got it.
Patrick: Careful.
"SpongeBob: Little bit...  Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?"
"Patrick: Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my melon, as you so drolly put it, to slip out."
"SpongeBob: Okay, sure. Let's give it a try.  Gary! Speak to me. Oh...  Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere.  Slime! That's it!  Slime it up, Gar-bear."
Patrick: Abominable!
"SpongeBob: Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out."
SpongeBob: Hey. Head Shrinking for Beginners.  Hm...
"SpongeBob:  Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary."
"Patrick: SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck..."
SpongeBob: You'll need to dumb down to get free!
"Patrick:  Who's sporting the big brain now, hm?"
"SpongeBob: All right, Patrick! Let's get stupid! Yeah!"
SpongeBob: Electronics.
SpongeBob: Whew. I hope this works.
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
"Patrick: I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least..."
"SpongeBob: We've got drool! Patrick, it's working!"
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick:  This is insulting my intelligence.  And I adore it!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Sir Urchin:  Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
"SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!"
"SpongeBob: Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella."
Patrick: Huh? Ah.
"SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?"
"Patrick: Boy, am I ever!  A book? I love books!  A book!  A book!"
"SpongeBob:  That's right, Patrick.  Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh?"
Squidward: Stop playing... in my yard!
"SpongeBob: Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway."
"Patrick: No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce."
"Squidward: Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!"
"Patrick: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play in... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob!  I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!"
Squidward: I choose Patrick...  to play in Patrick's yard...  and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody...  in here!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick!  The road!  Patrick! What are we gonna do?
Patrick: I'll mail myself to your house!
"SpongeBob: Sit tight, Patrick! I'm coming to get you!  No!"
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.  Patrick! Call me!"
Patrick: Okay!
SpongeBob:  SquarePants residence.
Patrick: What are we gonna do?!
SpongeBob: Hmmmm... have we ever dug a tunnel between our two houses?
Patrick: No.  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Both: We did it!
SpongeBob: Tag! You're it!
Patrick: Tag! You're it!
SpongeBob: Tag! You're it!
Patrick: Tag! You're it!
SpongeBob: Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Patrick:
SpongeBob: You're it!
Patrick: You're it!
Squidward:  Must... block... out... noise!
"Patrick: Knock, knock!"
SpongeBob: Who's there?
Patrick: I don't know!
"Squidward:  I thought I told you two to stay off my...  yard.  Patrick!  Patrick, would you shut...?  Where is he?  SpongeBob.  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, I am trying to...  sleep?  Aha!  Hey, Gary."
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Where are those two morons?  Where are they?!
"SpongeBob:  Ohh... Patrick, check out these roots!"
Patrick: They're dancing!
"SpongeBob: Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance, baby!"
Patrick: Squidward's house wants to play too!
Squidward: My house!
SpongeBob: Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy.
Patrick: Must've been something it ate.
SpongeBob: It ate Squidward!
Patrick:  That'll do it.
Squidward:  I knew you two reprobates were behind this.
SpongeBob: Yeah! We're reprobates!
Squidward: That was an insult.
Patrick: And we're insulted!
Squidward: Why were you digging under my yard?
"SpongeBob: You told us not to walk on your yard, so we walked under it."
Squidward: But you buried my house!
Patrick: No need to thank us.
Squidward: Thank you?!
Patrick: You're welcome.
Squidward:
Patrick: Missed.
SpongeBob: Somebody wants to play Tag!
Patrick: Tag! You're it!
SpongeBob: Not it!
Squidward:
Patrick: Whee!
SpongeBob:  Squidward wins!
"Squidward: Now, you're gonna play a new game called, Digging Out my House!"
SpongeBob: Oh boy!
Squidward: And I'm gonna play Sit and Relax until you're finished.  Barnacle brains.  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward"
Squidward:
SpongeBob: Yuh oh!
Squidward: I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three. I am going to grind you into chum! One!
"Patrick:  He's counting, anything but counting!  Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!!!"
Squidward: Two!
Patrick:  He's already at number two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?!
Squidward: Th-ree!
Patrick:
Plankton: Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts.
SpongeBob:  Must dig! Ohhh! The rock's too hard!
Squidward:  You... two... morons... sunk my house!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  We're sorry!
"Squidward: I'm gonna-  Uh, oh."
"SpongeBob:  Ahhhh.  Good morning, Squidward! Another beautiful day under Bikini Bottom!"
Squidward:  I hate neighbors.
"Ricky Gervais:   Ten years ago, an unknown   pirate from Encino began a  decade-long obsession  with TV's most beloved  an absorbent sponge. And today,  a mere ten years later, obviously,  ten years ago, I said that,  he has traveled all the way to a far off land known as, Burbank.  To find Nicktoons Animation Studio  and meet his idol  face to face for the first time  in  ten years...it's ten years ago.  It's ten years ago.  Let's see what happens, yeah."
"Patchy the Pirate: Oh. Bye, Mom. Thanks for the lift.  Hey, kids. Isn't this exciting? I'm here at Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob SquarePants. And I'm gonna ask him if he'll be my guest of honor on my tenth anniversary TV special.  Come on.  Ahoy."
"Security Guard:  Sir, may I help you?"
Patchy: Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week.
"Security Guard: Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir."
Patchy: That's okay. I can wait.  SpongeBob?!
"Security Guard: Sir, please step away from the gate."
"Patchy: Aw, poop deck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show."
Security Guard: Uh-huh.  Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.
Patchy: Yeah.
"Security Guard: In that case, please step right inside, sir."
"Patchy: Woo! Oh, hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Where's he? At lunch?  At an important meeting?"
"Security Guard: I'm not sure, sir."
Patchy: Getting his boat waxed?
"Security Guard:  This way, sir."
Patchy: What's he really like?
"Security Guard:  This way, sir."
Patchy: Does he come in everyday?
"Security Guard:  This way, sir."
Patchy: Does he dye his hair?
"Security Guard:  Walk this way, sir."
Patchy: Huh?
"Security Guard: Here you are, sir. Please wait here while you wait.  Can I get you anything, sir?"
Patchy: Yeah. A shrimp cocktail.  Ooh. That's what I call service...  with a smile.
Gary:  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.
"SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary!"
Gary:  Meow.
"SpongeBob: A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day."
Squidward:  What the?
"See you at the big event, Squidward!  Can you believe that it's been eleventy-seven years already?"
"Gary:  Meow, Meow, Meow."
"SpongeBob: Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab."
Harold SquarePants: I don't know. This doesn't seem like a family restaurant.
"Margaret SquarePants: Oh.  Well, what do you think, baby? Should we eat here?  Well, okay, then.  What would you like?"
"SpongeBob: Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready."
SpongeBob:
"Patchy: Security, more shrimp cocktail in casting, please. Thank you."
"Devil Potty: Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk."
"Angel Potty: That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob."
"Patchy: Yeah, good point."
"Devil Potty: Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you?"
Patchy: Yeah. No. I mean...
Devil Potty: Then do it.
"Angel Potty: Don't do it, Patchy."
Devil Potty: Come on. Do it! Do it!
"Patchy: I shall.  Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show."
Rosario Dawson: Hello?
"Patchy: Uh, hello, Rosario."
"Rosario Dawson: Oh, Goodness."
"Patchy: It's Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob"
Patchy:  Fan Club. I'm throwing a little TV
"Patchy: show-tacular, and I need a little celebrity wind in my sail, so to speak."
Rosario Dawson: Okay. You need a little mouthwash is what you need.
Patchy: I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest.
Rosario Dawson: Are you going to be in the same city?
"Patchy: Of course, silly. We'll be working closely together all day."
"Patchy: Well, back to the old Rolodex. Uh, Bo Derek. Bo Diddly. Eddie Deezen. Eddie Deezen?"
"Eddie Deezen: Hey, when do we film?"
"Security Guard: This way, sir."
Patchy: Ooh. This will be good.
Triumph the Insulting Comic Dog: Yes?
"Patchy: Ahoy, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog."
Triumph: I'm Busy. Hurry up.
Patchy: This is Patchy the Pirate.
"Triumph: Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing."
"Patchy: You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp."
Triumph: Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box.
"Patchy: The one from Encino. It's Patchy, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club."
"Triumph: Oh, the president. Well, your mother must be so proud."
"Triumph: Listen, Scratchy."
Patchy: It's Patchy.
"Triumph: You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life."
Patchy: What?
"Triumph: So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?"
Patchy: None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.
"Triumph: Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network. Kind of."
"Patchy: It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph."
"Triumph: Oh, it would mean a lot. Well, why didn't you say so? That changes everything."
Patchy: Oh.
"Triumph: You know, I'd love to be on your show. I'd love it as much as I love pulling ticks off my butt."
"Patchy: Well, fine. Who needs you, you filthy mongrel?"
"Triumph: Okay, Captain Loser. Send me a script."
"Patchy: Great! So, you'll be on my show?"
"Triumph: Sure, of course. I'm sure that it's a great script. Three, two, one. For me to poop on!"
"Patchy: Oh, yeah, well, I'll have you know, you are not the biggest star to tell me that. Hello? Hello?"
"Harold: Hey, hey. Chill out, buddy. We all want to get into the Krusty Krab as much as you do."
"SpongeBob: But I don't have time to wait in line. Sorry, but I can't be late today."
Harold: Oh!
Mable-Monica: Ah!
Isabelle Fish: Ooh!
Sadie: What the?
Frankie Billy: Hey!
Fred: Ah!
Tom: Eh!
Shubie: Uh!
"SpongeBob: Sorry, everyone, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: Sit down, boy."
"SpongeBob: Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs:  Today's a big a day for the Krusty Krab.  So I want yous to listen up.  It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula.
Squidward: Isn't that just the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: No. It's a holographic projection of the Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances.
Squidward: You mean the front door and the back door?
Mr. Krabs: Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!
"SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward."
Squidward: What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.
Mr. Krabs: Don't make me have a flashback.
"Squidward: All right, point taken."
"Mr. Krabs: And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some extra security."
Squidward:  You hired Patrick?
"Mr. Krabs: What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters."
"Patrick:  Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!"
Mr. Krabs: Plankton doesn't stand a chance.
"Plankton:  It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!"
"Karen:  Well, you'll never get the formula with that attitude.  Maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number."
"Plankton: Oh, yeah? You try getting launched."
"Karen: Oh, right, the launchings.  I've got them all on my hard drive."
Mr. Krabs: Fore!
Plankton: Ow!
"Mr. Krabs: I'm tired today, Plankton.  You're just gonna have to launch yourself."
Plankton: Splat.
Plankton: Karen?!
Karen: I'm sorry. That last part always makes me laugh.
Plankton: It's just no use!
Karen:  Today's the  perfect day to steal the recipe. Krabs will be completely distracted by all the festivities. You can do this.
Plankton: You really think so?
"Karen: Of course, I do. Now who's my big man?"
"Plankton: Oh, Karen."
Karen: Come on. Come on. Who's my big strong man?
Plankton: I am.
Karen: That's right. Now get out there and steal that recipe.
"Plankton:  Yes, Ma'am!"
"Patchy: Hey, LeBron, how's the Dribbling?"

Tina Fey: Hello.
"Patchy: Ahoy, Tina."
Tina Fey: Who is this?
Patchy: Patchy... the pirate.
"Tina Fey: Oh, I don't know any pirates anymore. Are you sure you have the right number?"
"Patchy: Hey, listen, us bad soul sistas have to stick  together, huh?"
Tina Fey: Sure.
"Patchy: Great, 'cause I'm throwing a huge telestravaganza for SpongeBob SquarePants and I'd love it if you'd come down and sing a song for us."
"Tina Fey: I'm not much for singing, but I love SpongeBob. Who else is going to be performing?"
"Patchy: Aren't you the modest one? Well, SpongeBob, for one, will be on the show."
"Tina Fey: Oh, Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob?"
Patchy: Who?
"Tina Fey: Well, you said SpongeBob is going to be on the show."
Patchy: That's right. The little sponge is the guest of honor.
"Tina Fey: But, he's a cartoon, so you mean the guy who does the voice, right?"
"Patchy: Listen, Miss Turner, you let me handle the guests. You stick to your singing and dancing."
"Tina Fey: Mrs. Turner? Oh, no, this isn't Tina Turner. This is Tina Fey."
Patchy: Who?
"Patchy: Hello? Hello, Tina? You'd better be good to me."

"Will Ferrell: Oh, really? Well, I'm president of the SpongeBob Fan Club, Tarzana chapter, and I'm throwing a TV show, too,  so get in line."
Patchy: What?! You can't do that!
"Will Ferrell: Can't I? Well, guess what? I'm doing it. You'd better wrap your mind around it because guess what?  My show's also gonna be a lot better."
Patchy: Doubt it. Who are your guests?
"Will Ferrell: You name it, we've go it: Hollywood stars, musical people, singers, jugglers, a guy who does things with knifes.  Do you have that,  huh? Who do you have?"
Patchy: Hang on to your hat. Sir Quentin and Mr. Tinder. Ever heard of 'em?
Will Ferrell: What?! The world's fifth best ventriloquist and his wooden sidekick?
"Patchy: Of course, silly."
"Will Ferrell: No way!  No!  Okay, you win this time, but just you wait for the 20th. 'Cause I will come at you harder and faster."

SpongeBob: I thought you said that I would be in charge of decorations.
Mr. Krabs: What? But you are.
SpongeBob: I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!
"Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I had chores for you, but you won't do 'em anyway."
Squidward: It only took you eleventy-seven years for you to figure that out?
"Mr. Krabs: Here's your budget, boy.  Decorate it any way you want."
SpongeBob: Wow! Fifty cents!
Squidward: You’re letting SpongeBob decorate? Remember all the other times SpongeBob decorated?

SpongeBob: Yee-haw!
SpongeBob: You come here often?

"Mr. Krabs and Squidward: Anybody, I don't care who!"
SpongeBob: How do we get out?
"Mr. Krabs: Everybody calm down. I spent a lifetime working in this restaurant, and I know there's only one way out of here."
Patrick: A high school diploma?
"Mr. Krabs: No,  the air duct.  This way boys.  All we gotta to do is head through this duct."
Squidward: Which one? There must be 20 ways to go.
"SpongeBob: Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized."
"Mr. Krabs:  Uh, hmm, uh..."
"SpongeBob:  Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, according to the map, we just go straight, take a right between these three moldy tree stumps, then head towards that kidney-bean shaped puddle of gravy."
"Squidward: That's not the map, you old barnacle. those are  three moles and a birthmark."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh. All right,  then, let's try this one."
Squidward:  It's this way.
Patrick: Here it is.
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days."

"Mr. Krabs: Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, into me office before anyone sees us."
Plankton: What? You went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?
"SpongeBob: We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned close and whispered the recipe."
Plankton: Yes? Go on.

Crowd: We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want to spend money!
Harold: What do we want?
Crowd: Krabby Patties!
Harold: Why do want them?
Crowd: To Spend Money!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh no. All that loose change out there  is driving me wallet mad with money lost.  Poor little guy's starving.  There you go, boy. You're free. Go towards the money boy. Towards the money!"
Dave: Hey a wallet!  And there's 50 bucks in it. All right!
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Oh no!  What am I going to do?  We gotta get out of here. Now!
SpongeBob: Oh. If only Sandy were here. She could help us.
"Patrick: Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet!  Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come."

Fish: What has happened to the theater?
Another Fish: Lousy costumes.
Wedding Officiant: I didn't know this was a play.
"Patchy: Well kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh well. We already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  Hello children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob did not just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought.  Then he evolved into  a primitive rendering... And along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. And phases and phanges.  And change can be very painful. For instance,  did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show?  Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked."

The Guy on the Penny: See?
Patchy: I knew it. SpongeBob.
Crowd: We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: We didn't even get to celebrate the Krusty Krab's eleventy-seventh anniversary. We missed what could have been the greatest party ever!
Patrick: Hmm. You guys ready to give up?
Mr. Krabs: Yes.
Squidward: Yes.
"Patrick: And I'll just write my... myself down here for... for giving up too. Right, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I don't want to give up."

Mr. Krabs: I didn't make any money.
Squidward: I never made anyone sick with envy.
Patrick: I didn't get to sleep in  this morning.

Mr. Krabs: To concoct an elaborate escape plan?

"Ricky Gervais: Wow, Patchy sure made a mess of things, didn't he? He's not much of a pirate either, really, come to think of it.  That's the problem.  Not like Blackbeard. Whoa, now there was a pirate.  Now Blackbeard  would have been able to get the real A-listers  on his TV special.  Yeah, your Bruce Willises and your Gwyneth Paltrows  and Ricky Gervaises.  Let's not forget him. Brilliant.  He wouldn't even have to shanghai them.  They would have  shown up on set out of respect.  and fear.  Back then, pirates were serious business.  Patchy's kinda  giving pirates a bad name, really,  if I'm being brutally honest.  Oh well, thanks for watching, kiddies. We'll see you at the 20th anniversary.  That's 10 years from now. Starting now."

"Patchy: Oh, hi, kids! Patchy Pirate here on a glorious day. I'm going to deliver this here very special present to SpongeBob on his birthday. That is, if I can get this blasted boat to start.  And start!"
Potty: Maybe if you remembered to fill the tank with gas...
"Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're full of gas! Get outta here!"
Potty:  I see the problem!
Patchy:  Walking is better than driving anyway. I've been meaning to work on me land legs.
"Potty: Squawk, squawk!"
Patchy:  Now to see which way the wind is blowing.  This way!  Whoa!
Potty:  Hard to port!
SpongeBob's alarm clock: Wake up!
Gary:
"SpongeBob: What? Today? My birthday? Oh, Gary, you know I never pay attention to those sorts of things."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, wow, Gary! Did you make me this jellyfishing net yourself?"
Gary:  Meow!
SpongeBob: Best present ever!
"Sandy: Aw, come on, Patrick. We've been up all night. For the one millionth time,  you're going to get SpongeBob out of his house with a sight-seeing tour so we can go in and decorate it for his surprise party.  Okay?! Repeat it back to me."
Patrick: Gotcha. I'm gonna collect all the pretty eggs that I can see and repeat it back to me.
"Patrick: Hmm?  Oh, would you look at the hour? It's almost time for me to take SpongeBob on that tour so you guys can decorate his house."
"Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Old Man Walker, Bubble Bass, and Plankton:  Huh?"
Plankton: Huh. I guess even a broken moron can be right once a day.
"Patrick: Hey, what's the big idea?"
"Plankton:  It's part of the plan, idiot! I jump from your shorts into SpongeBob's pocket to get his keys? Remember?"
"Patrick: Okay, well, don't mess with my stuff in there.  Get SpongeBob on the bus. Get SpongeBob on the bus. Get SpongeBob on the bus."
"SpongeBob:  Hi, buddy."
Patrick: Uh...
SpongeBob:  You remembered my birthday!
"SpongeBob: Oh, and you got me a sight-seeing bus tour as a present!"
"Patrick:  Huh? Oh, oh! And—and there's a secret I'm not supposed to tell you, which is... Nope. I lost everything in the fire. Who are you? Who am I? Where are we?"
"SpongeBob: I have an idea, pal. How would you like to take a little sight-seeing tour with me?"
"Patrick: Wow. Thank you, kind stranger."
Plankton: Hmm?  Ow!  I've got his house key!  Hey! This is the key to the Krusty Krab!  The secret formula is—  Ow!
"Mr. Krabs:  Nice work, Plankton, and nice try.  Hold on there, old timer.  We're gonna need you as a lookout."
Old Man Walker: What? Cook out?
"Mr. Krabs: When you see SpongeBob approaching, give a holler. Can ya holler?"
"Mr. Krabs: Eh, not bad.  You just keep practicing that, tiger."
Old Man Walker: Huh? Tiger? There's a tiger?  Oh!
Sandy:  Come on! We need to make room inside for the party.
Plankton:  I could use a little help here!
"Mr. Krabs:  Sorry, my claws are full."
Bubble Bass:  Where do we put all this junk?
Sandy: Follow me. Just a little further.
"Squidward:  Ah, I sure worked up that sweat.  What is SpongeBob's awful furniture doing in my house?"
"Sandy:  We're gussying up SpongeBob's house for his party, and something about you tells me you are quite the interior decorator."
Squidward: Hmm?  Of course! I didn't give myself all those awards for nothing!
Sandy: Yee-haw! SpongeBob's place is gonna look prettier than a country bride!
"SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! Oh, this is so exciting! I wonder where we're going?"
Rube: We're going to Surface Land!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists:"
SpongeBob: Surface Land?
Patrick:
"Rube:  Hi, everybody, and welcome to Surface Land Tours! I'm your tour guide, Rube."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Hi, Rube!"
"Rube: Before we drive to the amazing Surface Land, I'm required to read you these tour bus rules.  Please sit in an upright position.  Absolutely no bad language!  No horseplay!  And no digging, no dancing, no tanning, no cooking, no fencing, no drowning, no molting, no running, no trespassing, no peeking, and no balloons!"
SpongeBob: Aww. Not even birthday balloons?
"Rube:  Oh, my goodness! Is it your birthday?"
SpongeBob:  Yes!
"Rube: Well, I would love for everyone to sing happy birthday to you!"
Tourist #1: Yes!
"SpongeBob: Aww, really? That is so —"
"Rube: Not now, of course. Tour time is tight!  Whoa!  Okay, everybody, we're on Upseedaisy Street, and ready for lift off!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Lift off?
Rube: Amazing!
"SpongeBob: Oh, are we there yet?"
Rube: Almost. But we need a little boast to the surface.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
French Narrator: One Little Boast to the Surface Later...
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!"
"SpongeBob: Look, it's Sandy's friend, Frenchy! Oui, oui!"
"Rube: You can say that again, birthday boy. Oui, oui!"
Patrick:  Can you guys please stop saying wee wee?  Gotta go! Gotta go!
"Rube: Wave goodbye to Frenchy, everybody!"
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Goodbye, Frenchy!"
"French Narrator: Au revoir, my friends!"
David Hasselhoff:  Ah! Tartar sauce!
"Rube: Now remember, everyone, keep your arms and legs inside the bus at all times 'cause we are about to encounter a gaggle of nearly naked beach giraffes!"
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nearly naked beach giraffes!
"Rube: Don't worry, everyone. The beach giraffes may look crazy, but they're actually peaceful creatures. Let's get a closer look."
"Can: Hey, kids, welcome to Beach Blanket Bean-go!  And here's your host, Beanie McBeans!"
Beanie McBeans:  Hey! What do you want?
Beach Goers: Beans!
Beanie McBeans: When do you want them?
Beach Goers: Beans!
"Beanie McBeans: Ha, ha!"
"Beach Goers: Beans, beans, beans...!"
"Beanie McBeans:  Beans, beans, good for your heart! They make you strong, they make you smart! When I eat beans, I squeal! I eat beans with every meal! You do, too! You know you do!  Beans, beans!  Beans, beans, beans!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
"Patrick: Oh, he's good."
"Beanie McBeans:  All right, you know the rules. First question: How many beans are in a 16 ounce can?"
Contestant #1: Uh? Three million?
Beanie McBeans: Sorry! Wrong answer!
Contestant #1:  Yeah!
Beanie McBeans: Better luck next time! And now it's time for our next contestant.
Contestant #2:  Hi!
Beanie McBeans: What is your favorite kind of bean?
Contestant #2: Um... strawberry beans?
Beanie McBeans: Is the correct answer!
Contestant #2: Ooh! Yay!
Patrick: So many beans!
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Rube:  Whoa!
Patrick: Must have beans!
"SpongeBob, Rube, and the tourists: Whoa! Uh-oh!"
"Patrick: Beans, beans, beans, beans, beans!"
Beach Goers: Whoa!
Rube: Stop!
Patrick:  Wrong answer!
SpongeBob: Patrick! You ate all the water!
Patrick: It's not my fault. The water got in the way!
"Rube: Passengers, do not panic! We can get water right over there."
Female Beach Goer:  Okay. Perfect!
Rube: Ah! And we're back!
"SpongeBob: Yeesh, I thought this was my birthday, not my deathday!  I'm sorry, Patrick. I was just kidding."
SpongeBob: Oh! What am I looking at?!
Rube: You're looking at an amazing creature that is just as afraid as you are of it.
SpongeBob and Patrick:  I doubt it!
"Rube: I'm telling ya, that is a blue feathered northwestern pie-dragon. So calm down, guys. It only eats pies.  I was wrong! It's gonna eat us! Run!"
Dog Walker:  Whoa!
Mr. Krabs: I should be decorating! No one here knows diddly about SpongeBob!
Squidward: I know more about SpongeBob than I care to! So I should decorate.
Mrs. Puff:  Have you ever taught him to drive?!
Plankton:  Have you ever tried to annihilate him?!
Sandy: Now hold your horses! Seems like everyone has their own ideas about how to decorate for SpongeBob.
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Plankton, and Bubble Bass:  Surprise!"
Sandy: Not now!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, since SpongeBob works for me, I know he'd like  a Krusty Krab theme!"
"Plankton: Working for you means he's a masochist. So, a torture theme is the way to go.  Ow!"
Mrs. Puff: A driving theme is what SpongeBob would love.
Squidward:  Hmm. Unleaded.
Bubble Bass:  You're all lame! The theme has got to be Mermaid Man or nada.
Squidward:  I'm obviously his idol. A theme based on me is the only —
"Sandy: Everybody hog-tie your lips and listen up!  Since we all know what SpongeBob likes best, how about each of us gets to decorate one section of the house?"
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Plankton, and Bubble Bass:  Oh!"
"Sandy: Hiya!  Oh. Sorry, Squidward."
"Squidward:  Hmm. Sorry, Squidward..."
Bubble Bass:  Behold my super pit power!
"Squidward: No, no, no!"
Mrs. Puff: Ew!  Will you kindly keep your Squidward puddle on your side of the line?!
"Mr. Krabs: Ha! You tell him, sweetheart.  Whoa!  That hurt-erer."
"Plankton:  Oh, yeah, looks like the Party Wars are just beginning."
Sandy: Eew!
Mr. Krabs:  You did that on purpose.
Sandy: Aw! Tell it to your Aunt Chovy!
"Old Man Walker:  Well, I need to use the little boy's room."
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes! What I need is you!"
"Old Man Walker: Oh, just — wait a minute, lady!"
Mrs. Puff:  Now my Pedestrians Have The Right Of Way display is perfect!
Old Man Walker: Is this the restroom?
Bubble Bass: Why do you get to use this elder? I saw him first! You'll make a great Mermaid Man.
Old Man Walker: There's only one thing I want to make.
Rube: Aren't these leafy things amazing?
SpongeBob: Ooh! My friend Sandy has one of these. They call them trees.
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists:  Whoa!"
Rube:  I didn't know that. Wow! Look at the big brain on the birthday boy!
Patrick: Nobody looks at my friend's brain without permission!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists:  Whoa!"
"Dog Walker: Oh, who's a good dog?  Go get it! Go get it! Go get it, girl! Get it! Yeah!   Good girl!"
"SpongeBob: What a birthday! Beach giraffes, pie-dragons, and beans! Oh, I can't wait to see what happens next!"
"Rube: Oh, my! It's a flying pie!"
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!"
Patrick: And here comes the pie-dragon!
"Rube: That sure was a close one, eh, folks? Amazing!"
Dog Walker:  Whoa!
SpongeBob:  It's coming back!
Rube: We're not pie! Why is it chasing us?! Why? Why?
"SpongeBob: Patrick, let go of that pie!  Bad Patrick, bad!  Yah!"
"Patrick: Aww, I wanted flying pie."
SpongeBob:  Take this instead
"Rube: Okay. We'll stay on the path, where it's not so dangerous. And I think that this is the perfect time to sing Happy Birthday to our little square friend here!"
"Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: ♪ Happy birthday — ♪"
Charlie: Look out!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Road hog!"
"Party Guests: Oh, boy. Oh, man, I am starving. I haven't been to a party in 20 years."
"Larry: Yo, dude.  Is this the line for SpongeBob's party?"
"Slappy: Oh, yes. Mmm...  I brought the birthday cake."
Larry: It's gone.
"Slappy: Oh, no, it's still here."
"Larry:  Do me a favor, Slappy. When we're inside, stay away from me."
"Party Guests: Say, what a party!  They really dressed up the place. Yeah, there it is. Smells great."
"Margaret SquarePants: Our boy sure has a lot of interesting friends. What kind of party food is that, dear?"
"Harold SquarePants: Uh, aquarium fish flakes."
"Margaret SquarePants: Well, now it is a party!"
Mr. Krabs: Step right up to enter the Krusty Krab section of this party.
Old Man Walker:  What do I do to get in?
"Mr. Krabs: Just consent to a pat down, old timer."
"Old Man Walker: Oh, boy. Okay."
"Mr. Krabs:  Ooh!  Okay, you're good."
"Squidward:  Hmm. Lowbrow compared to highbrow. Say, aren't you a little old for this weenie wizard stuff?"
Bubble Bass:  I am casting a vanishing spell upon you. Begone!
Squidward: Begone!  Water!
Bubble Bass: Huh? Ooh! I have powers!
Harold and Grubby Grouper: Ooh! Cake!
"Sandy: Please, everybody, don't eat the party food!  We have to wait for SpongeBob! It's supposed to be a surprise!"
Party Guests: Surprise!
Sandy: Not now!
Party Guests: Aww!
Evelyn Annette:  Sorry.
Sandy:  Please be careful.
"Sandy: Hey, hey, hey! Don't sit on that table!"
"Slappy: Oh, I'm just having fun, and I brought cake."
Sandy: Aww! I just had my tail done! This makes me hotter than a billy goat in a pepper patch!  Hiya!
Slappy: Surprise.
Sandy: Not yet.
Tom: Hey!  How much for this one?
"Squidward: Oh, no. That's a present for SpongeBob—ten bucks."
Tom: Here's some fun back at ya!  I love your work.  Have you got anything heavier?
"Sandals: Ow, man. What the heck?"
"Plankton: It's a theme party. Get into it. Say it, Fred."
Fred: No.
Plankton: Say it!
Fred:  My leg.
Grubby Grouper:  Party games!
Sandy: Hey! Don't do that!
Sandy: Uh-oh. I hope someone brings a wall as a present.  Make that two walls.
"Mrs. Puff:  Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Sandy: Great idea, Puff! Some positive energy! Hey, everybody!  Dance party!  Yee-haw!  Come on, boys. Move those feet! Do-si-do!"
"Sandy: SpongeBob better come home soon. I don't know how long I can keep these folks dancing.  Oh, you took me by surprise."
Party Guests: Surprise!
Sandy: Not now!
"SpongeBob: Wow! In Surface Land, everywhere you go is full of surprises!"
"Patrick: Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't crashed yet."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Wow!"
"Rube: As you can see, Surface Land is full of unexplained wonders!"
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Whoa!"
"SpongeBob: Best birthday ride ever!  I've read about this place, Patrick. It's the Paperclip Jungle!"
Patrick: They're everywhere.
Female Office Employee #1: Just let me copy it!
Female Office Employee #2: My fault? How is it my fault?
"SpongeBob: Ooh, what happens in here?"
Patrick: Smells like flop sweat!
Rube: Shh! This is the secret hive of the Double-breasted Seer Suckers. Let's watch their strange rituals!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!"
Female Office Employee #3:  He's coming!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists: Huh?"
SpongeBob and Patrick: The pie dragon!
Rube: This bunch of bananas is getting too crazy to comfort. We'd better split!
PA System:  Lunch time!
"Boss, the Dog, the Dog Walker, and Office Employees:  Huh?"
"Rube: Crash positions, everybody!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Crash positions! Check!
SpongeBob: The Trusty Slab? Sounds familiar.
"Rube: Whew! Sorry for the detour, folks. Now back to de-tour."
"Patrick: Ooh!  They grow 'em big up here, SpongeBob! Oh, come here."
Rube: Let's watch these hungry beach giraffes as they struggle to communicate.
"Patrick (live-action): No, no, wait! Uh, I'll have the, uh..."
"Mr. Manward: Sir, could you please order something? There are a lot of people waiting here. Some of us have lives."
"Patrick (live-action): Oh, don't rush me! I almost had it! Uh..."
Patrick:  That guy's so dumb!
Carol: Where in tarnation is my lunch?! The service here is slower than a three-legged dog in molasses!
"Mr. Slabs:  Me customers! All right, all right, all right! What's the hold up here, Mr. Manward?"
"Mr. Manward: How should I know? Go ask your persnickety fry cook. Between him and this other idiot, we're not gonna make it through the lunch rush alive."
"Mr. Slabs: Well, I'll just see about that!  You'll be having the number three with cheese!"
"Patrick (live-action): Aw, that's what I was gonna order.  I'll have the—the number cheese with cheese."
Mr. Manward: Don't you have somewhere else to be a nitwit?
Patrick (live-action): Not until 4:00.
Mr. Slabs:  JimBob!
JimBob: Hi!
Mr. Slabs: Got a restaurant full of hungry customers out there! Where are the burgers?
"JimBob: Ooh, Mr. Slabs, you know that I can't serve a Slabby Patty ♪until it's cooked just right!♪  ♪Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right, Slabby Patty, day and night, what a nifty tasty sight! Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right—♪"

Mr. Slabs: Enough of that!
"JimBob: Sorry, sir."
Mr. Slabs: Get those ship-shape burgers shipped out or you'll be doing soft shoe across the street at the Crumb Basket!
"JimBob: Yes, Mr. Slabs. It won't happen again, Mr. Slabs. Sorry, Mr. Slabs."
"Mr. Slabs:  Hmm, that'll be the day..."
"JimBob: All right, troops, prepare to be deployed!"

"SpongeBob:  Never get out of the bus, Patrick. Never get out of the bus!"
Patrick: Who's hungry?
"Rube: Amazing! Lunch time, everybody!"
Carol: Where's the meat? Dagnabit! That's it!  I'm taking my business elsewhere!
"Mr. Charleston: You're not going anywhere, sister! Sit down!  And everybody freeze! This is a robbery!  Slabs!  Show yourself!"
Mr. Slabs:  You can only have me register over me cold lifeless shell!
Mr. Charleston: Nobody wants your stupid money.
Mr. Slabs: Huh?
"Mr. Charleston: Hand over the Slabby Patty secret sauce recipe and nobody gets vaporized, see?  You all have until the count of three. A-one, a-two..."
Carol:  Ha! Karate chop!  You're welcome!
Patrick: Ha! She chopped him real good!
"Mr. Slabs: Fear not, gentle customers. This is not a robber.  This is my lame competition across the street,  Charleston!"
Mr. Charleston: What gave me away? My voice?
"Mr. Slabs: No, your knit cap had one eye hole."
"Mr. Charleston: Ugh! Foiled by a hand crocheted gift! Mark my words, Slabs, maybe not today but, oh, someday, that secret sauce recipe will be mine!"
"Mr. Slabs: Nice try, weirdo."
Mr. Charleston:  Where am I?
"Rube: Well, feeding time is over. Hang on, everybody!"
"Patchy: Eh, my Potty needs to use your potty."
Mr. Manward: Sorry. No.
"Patchy: Sorry, Potty, you'll have to hold it. Come on!"
Potty:  Easy for you to say!
"Rube:  Oh, excuse me, sir.  Oh, pardon me!"
"SpongeBob: Ooh, that was delicious. I love surface food!"
Patrick: You missed a spot.
Charlie: Ugh! Thanks.
"Rube: Okay, everybody, the next point of interest is coming up in just a few short minutes, so just relax and enjoy the—"
"SpongeBob: Stop the bus!  Rube, what is that?!"
"Rube: Oh, that's what they call a fish prison. And one thing is for sure, you don't ever want to end up in there."
"Pearl Slabs: Huh?  Who left this aquarium out here?  Hi, nice to meet you!"
Sandy: I feel like I've got three wheels down and my axles are dragging.  Where in tarnation is SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No!
Pearl Slabs: There! That's better!
"Rube: Okay, no need to panic, everyone. Just a slight delay! Heh.  Come on."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube, and the tourists:  Ooh!"
SpongeBob: What kind of monster would want to keep fish folk in jail like this? They're so beautiful.
Patrick: Yeah!  Aww.  I want to kiss that one!
"SpongeBob: Uh,  I'm just gonna head back to my seat."
Rube:  Come on. Come on!
Patrick: Having trouble?
Rube: Yeah. It's amazing. I can't get this dang thing to budge.
"Patrick: Uh, hey! I have a great idea! I'll be right back!"
"Rube: Well, while we wait for the great idea,  let's all sing Happy Birthday to our fellow passenger!"
Rube and the tourists: ♪Happy—♪

Patrick: Yeah! I'm in love!
"Rube: I understand how you feel, Birthday Bob, but what can we do about it?"
SpongeBob:  Ooh!  Whee!
Rube: This is the most amazing thing I've ever done!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Rube and the tourists: To the beach!"
"Rube: Okay, everyone, we are about to begin our final descent into Bikini Bottom. So this is your last chance to take snapshots before we submerge."

Potty: I moved like a cat!
Patchy: I hope that beach bozo didn't damage SpongeBob's gift!  Now if I can only find a way to get out to—  Ooh! That island!  Then I can drop the present over Bikini Bottom.
Potty: Maybe you could take a ride on that?
"Patchy: Ooh!  All right, Potty, I'm ready! Fire!"
Potty:  Bombs away!

Potty: Maybe if you remembered to fill the tank with gas...
"Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're full of gas! Get outta here!"
Potty:  I see the problem!
Patchy:  Walking is better than driving anyway. I've been meaning to work on me land legs.
"Potty: Squawk, squawk!"
Patchy:  Now to see which way the wind is blowing.  This way!  Whoa!
Potty:  Hard to port!
SpongeBob's alarm clock: Wake up!
Gary:

"SpongeBob:  Oh, wow, Gary! Did you make me this jellyfishing net yourself?"
Gary:  Meow!
SpongeBob: Best present ever!
Patrick:

Patrick: Uh...
SpongeBob:  You remembered my birthday!
"SpongeBob: Oh, and you got me a sight-seeing bus tour as a present!"
"Patrick:  Huh? Oh, oh! No, SpongeBob. I got you a sightseeing tour as a present."
"SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! Oh, this is so exciting! I wonder where we're going?"
Rube: We're going to Surface Land!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists:"
SpongeBob: Surface Land?
Patrick:
"Rube:  Hi, everybody, and welcome to Surface Land Tours! I'm your tour guide, Rube."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Hi, Rube!"
"Rube: Before we drive to the amazing Surface Land, I'm required to read you these tour bus rules.  Please sit in an upright position.  Absolutely no bad language!  No horseplay!  And no digging, no dancing, no tanning, no cooking, no fencing, no drowning, no molting, no running, no trespassing, no peeking, and no balloons!"
SpongeBob: Aww. Not even birthday balloons?
"Rube:  Oh, my goodness! Is it your birthday?"
SpongeBob:  Yes!
"Rube: Well, I would love for everyone to sing happy birthday to you!"
Tourist #1: Yes!
"SpongeBob: Aww, really? That is so—"
"Rube: Not now, of course. Tour time is tight!  Whoa!  Okay, everybody, we're on Upseedaisy Street, and ready for lift off!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Lift off?
Rube: Amazing!
"SpongeBob: Oh, are we there yet?"
Rube: Almost. But we need a little boast to the surface.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
David Hasselhoff:  Ah! Tartar sauce!
"Rube: Now remember, everyone, keep your arms and legs inside the bus at all times 'cause we are about to encounter a gaggle of nearly naked beach giraffes!"
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Ooh!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nearly naked beach giraffes!
"Rube: Don't worry, everyone. The beach giraffes may look crazy, but they're actually peaceful creatures. Let's get a closer look."
"Can: Hey, kids, welcome to Beach Blanket Bean-go!  And here's your host, Beanie McBeans!"

SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
"Patrick: Oh, he's good."
"Beanie McBeans:  All right, you know the rules. First question: How many beans are in a 16 ounce can?"
Contestant: Uh? Three million?
Beanie McBeans: Sorry! Wrong answer!
Contestant:  Yeah!
Patrick: So many beans!
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Rube:  Whoa!
Patrick: Must have beans!

"Patrick: Beans, beans, beans, beans, beans!"
Beach Goers: Whoa!
Rube: Stop!
Patrick:  Wrong answer!
SpongeBob: Patrick! You ate all the water!
Patrick: It's not my fault. The water got in the way!
"Rube: Passengers, do not panic! We can get water right over there."
Female Beach Goer:  Okay. Perfect!
Rube: Ah! And we're back!
"SpongeBob: Yeesh, I thought this was my birthday, not my deathday!  I'm sorry, Patrick. I was just kidding."
SpongeBob: Oh! What am I looking at?!
Rube: You're looking at an amazing creature that is just as afraid as you are of it.
SpongeBob and Patrick:  I doubt it!
"Rube: I'm telling ya, that is a blue feathered northwestern pie-dragon. So calm down, guys. It only eats pies.  I was wrong! It's gonna eat us! Run!"
Dog Walker:  Whoa!
"SpongeBob: Wow! In Surface Land, everywhere you go is full of surprises!"
"Patrick: Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't crashed yet."
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and the tourists: Wow!"
"Rube: Hey, is everybody hungry? Let's stop for a birthday lunch!"
SpongeBob: The Trusty Slab? Sounds familiar.
Rube: This is a example of typical feeding station for surface folk.
Rube: Let's watch these hungry beach giraffes as they struggle to communicate.
"Patrick (live-action): No, no, wait! Uh, I'll have the, uh..."
"Mr. Manward: Sir, could you please order something? There are a lot of people waiting here. Some of us have lives."
"Patrick (live-action): Oh, don't rush me! I almost had it! Uh..."
Patrick:  That guy's so dumb!
Carol: Where in tarnation is my lunch?! The service here is slower than a three-legged dog in molasses!
"Mr. Slabs:  Me customers! All right, all right, all right! What's the hold up here, Mr. Manward?"
"Mr. Manward: How should I know? Go ask your persnickety fry cook. Between him and this other idiot, we're not gonna make it through the lunch rush alive."
"Mr. Slabs: Well, I'll just see about that!  You'll be having the number three with cheese!"
"Patrick (live-action): Aw, that's what I was gonna order.  I'll have the—the number cheese with cheese."
Mr. Manward: Don't you have somewhere else to be a nitwit?
Patrick (live-action): Not until 4:00.
Mr. Slabs:  JimBob!
JimBob: Hi!
Mr. Slabs: Got a restaurant full of hungry customers out there! Where are the burgers?
"JimBob: Ooh, Mr. Slabs, you know that I can't serve a Slabby Patty ♪until it's cooked just right!♪  ♪Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right, Slabby Patty, day and night, what a nifty tasty sight! Slabby Patty and it's cooked just right—♪"

Mr. Slabs: Enough of that!
"JimBob: Sorry, sir."
Mr. Slabs: Get those ship-shape burgers shipped out or you'll be doing soft shoe across the street at the Crumb Basket!
"JimBob: Yes, Mr. Slabs. It won't happen again, Mr. Slabs. Sorry, Mr. Slabs."
"Mr. Slabs:  Hmm, that'll be the day..."
"JimBob: All right, troops, prepare to be deployed!"
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
Patrick: Giant patties!
JimBob:  What fun!
"SpongeBob:  Ooh, I just gotta get a closer look at that glorious spatula!"
"JimBob: Oops, forgot the cheese!"
"SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick! Patrick, help!"
"Patrick:  Huh?  Oh! I'm coming, buddy!"
"SpongeBob:  Never get out of the bus, Patrick. Never get out of the bus!"
Patrick: Who's hungry?
"Rube: Amazing! Lunch time, everybody!"
Carol: Where's the meat? Dagnabit! That's it!  I'm taking my business elsewhere!
"Mr. Charleston: You're not going anywhere, sister! Sit down!  And everybody freeze! This is a robbery!  Slabs!  Show yourself!"
Mr. Slabs:  You can only have me register over me cold lifeless shell!
Mr. Charleston: Nobody wants your stupid money.
Mr. Slabs: Huh?
"Mr. Charleston: Hand over the Slabby Patty secret sauce recipe and nobody gets vaporized, see?  You all have until the count of three. A-one, a-two..."
Carol:  Ha! Karate chop!  You're welcome!
Patrick: Ha! She chopped him real good!
"Mr. Slabs: Fear not, gentle customers. This is not a robber.  This is my lame competition across the street,  Charleston!"
Mr. Charleston: What gave me away? My voice?
"Mr. Slabs: No, your knit cap had one eye hole."
"Mr. Charleston: Ugh! Foiled by a hand crocheted gift! Mark my words, Slabs, maybe not today but, oh, someday, that secret sauce recipe will be mine!"
"Mr. Slabs: Nice try, weirdo."
Mr. Charleston:  Where am I?
"Rube: Well, feeding time is over. Hang on, everybody!"
"Patchy: Eh, my Potty needs to use your potty."
Mr. Manward: Sorry. No.
"Patchy: Sorry, Potty, you'll have to hold it. Come on!"
Potty:  Easy for you to say!
"Rube:  Oh, excuse me, sir.  Oh, pardon me!"
"SpongeBob: Ooh, that was delicious. I love surface food!"
Patrick: You missed a spot.
Charlie: Ugh! Thanks.
"Rube: Okay, everybody, the next point of interest is coming up in just a few short minutes, so just relax and enjoy the—"
"SpongeBob: Stop the bus!  Rube, what is that?!"
"Rube: Oh, that's what they call a fish prison. And one thing is for sure, you don't ever want to end up in there."
"Pearl Slabs: Huh?  Who left this aquarium out here?  Hi, nice to meet you!"
Sandy: I feel like I've got three wheels down and my axles are dragging.  Where in tarnation is SpongeBob?

"Sandy: Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!"
"Karen: That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact,  this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton.  With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected."
SpongeBob: Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
Sandy: And exactly how do you propose we find him?
"Karen: I saw Mr. Krabs pass by  just before my system failed, heading southwest."
"SpongeBob: Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!"
"Plankton:  Hehehehe!  Yeuch!  So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive!  Ahem! I meant destructive!"
"Gary:  Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww..."
"SpongeBob: Attaboy, Gary!"
All: Ahhhh!
"SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ahh, whew."
Sandy: Cliff!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:
"Sandy: Hold on, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob:  We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward?"
"Sandy: Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am."
Karen: What?
Sandy: Gotcha!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--...land?"
Plankton:  Fire in the hole!  Rats.
"Sandy: Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab!"
Patrick:  I can't feel my looking holes!
SpongeBob: The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach.
"Sandy: You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions.  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?"
"Patrick: I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary!"
"SpongeBob: Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch."
"Patrick: Great, now we're stuck."
"SpongeBob: No, we're not!  Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body."
Sandy: We must be heading in the right direction!
"Plankton:   Secret formula, you are mine!"
"Plankton: Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit!  Molecule by molecule!  Atom by atom!!  Uh-oh."
"Plankton: Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa!"
"Patrick:  Hey, i'm trying to sleep."
SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs!
"Sandy: He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? He froze up too."
Squidward: Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?
Sandy: And are you aware I just saved your life?
"Mr. Krabs: The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings."
"Karen: Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!"
Mr. Krabs: Duped? You don't mean by...
Karen: Now you're putting it together!
Mr. Krabs: My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward:  We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Mr. Krabs: We're doomed.
SpongeBob:  No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!
"Mr. Krabs: No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace."
Sandy: Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Patrick:  Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?
Sandy:
Patrick: Hahahaha!
Sandy: She's all fired up!
"SpongeBob: Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?"
Mr. Krabs: Lookin' clear so far.
SpongeBob: Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
French Narrator: One frozen wasteland later.
SpongeBob: Hooray! We made it.
Mr. Krabs: Okay... then where's my restaurant?
SpongeBob: Perhaps over there..
Mr. Krabs: And where's my formula?
Sandy:  Perhaps over there.
"Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?!"
SpongeBob: We're too late!
Mr. Krabs: We'll see about that boy-o!
"Harold:  Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!"
Mr. Krabs: This will only take a minute.
Plankton:  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open.
Mr. Krabs: Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Plankton: Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Mr. Krabs: I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.
"Plankton:  Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!"
"Patrick: Oh, that's easy!"
All of them: Patrick!
"Plankton: Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy."
"Sandy:  That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides."
"Plankton:&#160;: Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!"
Karen:  You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
"Plankton: Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon!"
"Plankton: Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: Then hand over my formula.
"Plankton: Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools?"
"Mr. Krabs: You get back here, Plankton!"
Squidward:  Here we go again...
Plankton:
Mr. Krabs: Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
"Plankton: I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close.  So long, suckers!"
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Everyone:
Plankton: Hehehe!
Mr. Krabs: We're trapped!
"Plankton: That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you."
Mr. Krabs: He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Patrick: Got any dipping sauce?
Plankton: A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Abominable Snow Mollusk:   Nom nom!
SpongeBob: Nom nom?
Abominable Snow Mollusk: Nom nom!  Nom nom!
"SpongeBob: W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!"
"Sandy: No, eat me!"
"Mr. Krabs: Don't eat me, eat Squidward!"
"Squidward: Wait, what?!"
Abominable Snow Mollusk:   Nom nom!
"SpongeBob: She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!"
Plankton: I better go while the going's good.
Abominable Snow Mollusk:   Jellybean!
Plankton: I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?"
Mr. Krabs: He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course.
"Plankton:  Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration."
"Squidward:  If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu."
SpongeBob: It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working.
"Mr. Krabs: Were you talking to me, Squidward?"
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. The f-f...
"Mr. Krabs: Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that."
SpongeBob: The fan... it...
"Mr. Krabs: You're not wearing shoes, lad. You're not going Section 8 on me, are ya?"
"SpongeBob: I was wearing shoes. They... It's so hot, they melted off."
Mr. Krabs: Melted off?
Squidward: The fan stopped working.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you didn't... forget... to pay the power bill again, did you?"
Mr. Krabs: Of course not! Here. Just fan yourself with some of this junk mail I keep finding in me mail box.
SpongeBob:
Mr. Krabs: That reminds me. Where are all me customers?
Squidward: Probably out enjoying this beautiful day where it was meant to be enjoyed.
Mr. Krabs: Could you be a little more specific?
Squidward: They're at the beach.
"Mr. Krabs: Boys, I forgot to tell ya! Close up shop. We're going to the beach today!"
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there!
Nat: Whoa!
"Mr. Krabs: My name is Eugene Krabs and I would like to know if I could interest either one of you in a fresh, delicious..."
SpongeBob:
"Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty, fresh off the grill!"
Frank: Are they free?
"Mr. Krabs: Yes! Today, they're only three dollars! Each."
Frank: Sounds great. But I left my wallet up on the sand.
Squidward: I told you!
Sandy: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: -eeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
Frank:
Sandy: -eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-haw! I love the beach!
"SpongeBob: Oh, that noise was Sandy."
Sandy: Y'all be careful! Looks like some big waves a-comin'!
Squidward: Who are you?
"Mr. Krabs: Either you buy a patty, or get off me wave!"
Sandy: Cowabunga!
Squidward: What next?
Patrick:
"SpongeBob: Aloha, Patrick!"
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, there, young feller! How'd you like to be our first customer in over seventeen working days?"
Patrick: I'd love to!
"Mr. Krabs: Squidward, show him the menu."
Squidward:
"Patrick: Uh, I can't quite see it from here. I'll just have to climb on board."
"SpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha! That's a good one Patrick: on-board! Whoa!"
Mr. Krabs: Careful! You're gonna capsize us!
Patrick: Almost up!
Squidward: You idiot!
"Patrick:  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eeeeeeee!"
SpongeBob: Patrick! Look out!
Sandy:  Locals only!
Patrick: What'd she say?
Mr. Krabs: Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!  Aaaaahhhhhh!
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Sandy: Wipeouuuuuuuuuuuuuut!
Mr. Krabs: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm.  Black sky.  Water spouts.... of blood.  Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley.
"Awesome Eddie: Guys, look!"
SpongeBob:
"Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?"
SpongeBob: Just dragging it around.
"Twitch: Hey there, home-dads."
SpongeBob: Huh?
Twitch: Welcome to our remote island.
SpongeBob: Island?
Squidward: Island?
"Twitch: That's right, kemo sabe. Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island."
SpongeBob: We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?
Twitch: The ocean works in mysterious ways.
Awesome Eddie: And waves.
Twitch: Mysterious waves.
Island wanderers:  Om.
Patrick:  Om.
SpongeBob: How did you guys get here?
"Twitch: Oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. This is Awesome Eddie, Big G..."
Chip: Hi.
"Twitch: Chip, and Silent Stan."
Twitch: And I'm Twitch.
SpongeBob: Why do they call you Twitch?
Twitch:  What?
SpongeBob: Never mind.
SpongeBob: So what did you say this house is made from again?
Twitch: Guano.
Squidward: Great.
"SpongeBob: Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon."
"Twitch: Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude."
Awesome Eddie: Yeah. The only way back is to surf there.
SpongeBob:  O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom?  Aaaaahhhhhh!  I don't know how to surf!
"Awesome Eddie: Whoa, chill out, little dude. We can teach you."
SpongeBob:  Cool!
"Narrator: Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day."
Narrator: Others...
"Narrator: ... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important."
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"Narrator: And sometimes, it's the retreat."
"Narrator: Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast..."
Twitch: Go!
Narrator: ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?"
Patrick: You bet!
SpongeBob: Down here!  See? It's a picture of Squidward!
Patrick: Wow.
"Narrator: But all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked."
SpongeBob and Patrick:
"Twitch: Well, dudes, I give up."
Awesome Eddie: What?
Twitch: These ho-dads are impossible to teach.  Especially the one on the end over there.
Awesome Eddie: What's that?
"Awesome Eddie: Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it."
SpongeBob: What's he saying?
Twitch: He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.
SpongeBob: Who?
"Twitch: His name  is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short."
Awesome Eddie and Chip: Amen.
"Twitch: We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect."
Patrick: Will there be nachos there?
"SpongeBob: Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch."
Twitch:  No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.
SpongeBob: How far up stream did you say it was?
"Twitch: Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there."
Awesome Eddie: We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.
"Twitch: Yeah, interpret that any way you want."
"Sandy: Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!"
"♪I'll make a beeline for the treeline. Getting back to nature always does me good. I'll make a beeline for the treeline, I just can't wait to get back in the woods. And if I need to close my eyes and dream, Of some quite mountain or stream, That's when I make the beeline for the treeline.♪"
SpongeBob: Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
Squidward: Again?!
SpongeBob:  Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys! I found the Cove!
Squidward: I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
"SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here."
Squidward: You've never even seen him!
SpongeBob: You've got to stop judging people by the way they look.
Squidward:  You're right.
Patrick:  Look!
SpongeBob: It's him!
"Squidward:  Oh, my-"
SpongeBob: It's JKL!  Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.
"Patrick: Plus, we wanna talk to you."
"SpongeBob: Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home?"
Patrick: Uh...
"Squidward: Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?"
Patrick: I kinda like staring at him.
"SpongeBob: I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?"
Patrick: Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
JKL: That... was your first lesson.
Squidward: What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
JKL:  Just keep breathing.
"Mr. Krabs:   Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?"
Flying Dutchman: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman:  Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the convenience store? You even spilled me milk!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, there ain't no use crying over it.  Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!"
"SpongeBob: Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?"
"Squidward: I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is..."
"Squidward:  Oh, wonderful."
"SpongeBob: Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson."
JKL:  Just... keep breathing.
Squidward: That's it?! I just wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
"Squidward: Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?"
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: And?
"SpongeBob: He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed."
Squidward: We're gonna be stuck here forever!
"Sandy: Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back.  Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance."
"Dennis: Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!"
"Flying Dutchman: Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, and I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow."
"Mr. Krabs: No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!"
"Squidward: Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night."
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Okay...
"Squidward: All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna..."
JKL: You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
JKL: Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers.
SpongeBob: Where's he going?! Come on!
SpongeBob:   Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Patrick: Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
SpongeBob: JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
JKL:  Uh...
"SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward:"
JKL: These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
Patrick: Increased chance of precipitation?
"JKL: Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed."
SpongeBob: A perfect wave?
"JKL: The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One."
"Patrick: Hey, that's what they used to call me!"
"JKL: It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. You'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever.  The Big One is almost upon us."
"Mr. Krabs: Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!"
Flying Dutchman: Ya promise?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth."
Flying Dutchman:  Liar!
Mr. Krabs: What?
Flying Dutchman: Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
Mr. Krabs: How do you know?
Flying Dutchman: Because I dated her in high school!
Mr. Krabs:  No!
Flying Dutchman: Whoops!
Sandy: This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful!  May Day! May Day! I'm goin' down! Repeat: Down!
"Flying Dutchman: And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the-  -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh!"
"Mr. Krabs: Uh... where is that, exactly?"
Sandy:  May Day!
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, all alone again.  Cashy!"
"Flying Dutchman:  Oh, what the... a tube sock? But that means..."
"Davy Jones: Yeah, that's right, baby! Welcome... to my locker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! ♪For a day-dream believer and a homecoming queen!♪"
"JKL: Get ready, dudes. It's coming."
"SpongeBob: JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf."
"JKL: Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know."
Squidward: Here it comes!
"SpongeBob: Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye."
"JKL: Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. And one of you... will not return."
Squidward: I volunteer SpongeBob.
"SpongeBob: Keep paddling, Patrick!"
Patrick: This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
SpongeBob: It's... the Big One!
Big One: Ha ha ha ha ha!
Patrick: No!
Big One:  Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggg!
"Patrick: Hey, I was gonna eat that!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, grab on!"
Big One:
Squidward:  Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
"SpongeBob: Hang on, Squidward! This is it!"
Patrick: Time for those lessons to pay off!
Squidward: Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
"Mr. Krabs: You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?"
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
Mr. Krabs: Who said that?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
JKL:  Looking for this?
SpongeBob: JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: And Cashy!  Cashy!
SpongeBob: JKL!
SpongeBob: No!
JKL: Little dude... I was born to do this.
Big One:
Squidward: I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
Patrick: Now what are we gonna do?
SpongeBob:
Nat: You hear a noise?
"Lifeguard: Everybody, look! A You-foe!"
Jimmy-Gus: A spaceman!
"Harold\Bill:  Don't make any funny moves, spaceman! You're not conquering our world without a fight!"
"Sandy:  I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend."
Beach goers:
Sandy: Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick.
Gus: Who?
Sandy: My friends. They went surfing and never returned.
"Gus: Is one of them, like, a little square dude with big teeth?"
Sandy: You some kinda mind-reader?
Gus: No.
People: Welcome home!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Twitch!"
"Twitch:  Grab a guitar, dude! Let's party!"
Big G:
Patrick: I love this song!
Mr. Krabs:
Squidward: Look!
SpongeBob: JKL!
JKL: Just keep breathing.
Mr. Krabs: Cashy!
"SpongeBob: Turn it up, Chip!"
"SpongeBob:  You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!"
"Gold Throated Singer: La, la, la, la, la, la, la!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!"
"Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!
"SpongeBob: Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever."
"Patrick: Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net."
"SpongeBob: Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloy netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world."
"Patrick: Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky."
"SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick."
"Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!"
Gary: Meow?
"SpongeBob: Oh, right. Pants."
Narrator: One pair of pants later...
"SpongeBob: Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!"
"SpongeBob: Put one over there, Patrick."
Patrick: I'm all done.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should spread out a little.
Johnny: Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.
Perch Perkins:  This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event.
"SpongeBob: Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return."
Mr. Krabs: Reward? How much we talkin' about?
SpongeBob: 12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'm on the case.
"Perch Perkins: Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on."
SpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?
"Patrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!"
"Patrick: Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?"
"SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net."
SpongeBob: Hello?!
"Patrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!"
"SpongeBob: What?! Really, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely."
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever."
"SpongeBob:  Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday."
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?"
"SpongeBob:  No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?"
Patrick: No.
"SpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present."
Patrick: A present? What is it?
SpongeBob:  It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
"Patrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.
"Patrick: Um,  I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened."
"SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Oh, maybe you should talk about it."
"Patrick: Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out."
SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear!
Patrick: I've said too much already.
SpongeBob/Confess-a-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!
"Patrick:  I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, we need to talk."
"Patrick: Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!"
"SpongeBob: Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?"
Patrick: I'm in here. Be out in a second.
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
Patrick:  Hello.
"SpongeBob: What's in your hand, Patrick?"
Patrick:  Nothing.
SpongeBob: What's in your other hand?
Patrick:  Nothing in my other hand.
"SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go."
"Patrick: Okay, bye."
SpongeBob: Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he?
Patrick: I would kill for a net like that!
"SpongeBob:  Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.  Good morning, Patrick."
"Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: What are you going to do today, buddy?"
"Patrick: Eh, nothing."
"SpongeBob:  Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick."
Patrick: Bye.
"SpongeBob: Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants."
Narrator: Eight hours later...
"SpongeBob:  Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go?"
"Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?"
"SpongeBob: Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?"
"Patrick: Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?"
"SpongeBob:  I don't have any binoculars, see?"
Patrick: You're acting weird.
SpongeBob: I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird!  You're... acting... weird!
"Patrick: Okay, bye!  Hello! Who are you?"
"SpongeBob:  Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean."
Patrick: Oh. No.
SpongeBob: Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.
Patrick: What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!
"SpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net.  I will pay one billion dollars for that net."
"Patrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net!  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, really?"
Patrick: You can't have it for any price.
SpongeBob: And why not?
Patrick: This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
SpongeBob:  A-ha!
"Patrick: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions."
"SpongeBob: Patrick,  I'm the scary mustache guy!"
"Patrick:  Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?"
SpongeBob:  Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!
Patrick: What?! I'm your best friend!
"SpongeBob: You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!"
Patrick: How could you think that?
SpongeBob: Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
Patrick: Gift.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net.
SpongeBob:  For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick?
"SpongeBob: What'cha doing, best friend?"
Patrick: I'm not your best friend. I'm a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Patrick: I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, no!  So, this is it?"
"Patrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is."
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me."
"Nat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two.  Look, you left your net on the bus again."
SpongeBob: Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
Nat Peterson: You do it every week. Now can we get going?
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by."
Patrick: You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!
"SpongeBob: Oh, come here, you big lug!"
All: Aww...
"Nat Peterson: They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind."
Patrick: I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
Passengers: Hooray!
Patrick: You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net.
SpongeBob: So did I.  My best friend made it for me.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Whee!
"SpongeBob: Hi, mailman!"
"SpongeBob: Okay,  see you tomorrow!"
"Patrick: Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?"
"SpongeBob: Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!"
"SpongeBob: That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest."
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Whoa!
SpongeBob: Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
"SpongeBob: This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!"
Patrick:  This guy's got shoes!
"Squidward: Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?"
Squidward: They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
SpongeBob: What kind of things?
Squidward: How should I know? Things people wanna buy.  Now keep your paws off my mail.
"SpongeBob: That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!"
Patrick: Is that gonna hurt?
"SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?"
Patrick: Uh...  More time for thinking.
"SpongeBob: No, something real, an item, something you would pay for."
Patrick:  A chocolate bar?
"SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!"
"SpongeBob: Fancy living, here we come!"
Patrick: Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers!
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead."
"SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?"
"Tom: Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!"
"Patrick: Yes, sir. With or without nuts?"
Tom: Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!
"SpongeBob: Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step!  Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?"
"Con man: Chocolate bars, eh?"
"SpongeBob: Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!"
Con man: Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
"Con man: No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?"
"SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, most certainly, sir!"
"Con man: Well,  no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these!"
SpongeBob: Wow... what is it?
"Con man: It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!"
"Con man:  But, I'm wasting my time.  You don't need these bags."
SpongeBob and Patrick: We need 'em! We need 'em!
"Con man: So long, boys! Happy hunting!  Suckers..."
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!"
SpongeBob: Let's try next door!
Con man: Yes?
"SpongeBob: Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?"
Con man: I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags.
Patrick: We'll take twenty!
"Sadie: Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?"
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
Sadie: That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.
"SpongeBob: One chocolate bar, coming up!"
Sadie:  I don't have time for this.
SpongeBob: I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice—
Tom: Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!
"SpongeBob: —lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic."
Patrick: Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
"SpongeBob: No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?"
Patrick: He said we were mediocre...
SpongeBob: That's it! He made us feel special!
"Patrick: Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!"
"SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick!"
SpongeBob: Why don't we try being nice?
"Patrick: Oh, okay."
"SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good."
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Hello?
Patrick: I love you.
"SpongeBob: I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try."
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Please. G-Go away!
"SpongeBob: Um,  H-H-How you doin'?"
Blue Fish with purple stripes: How am I doing?
SpongeBob: Wanna buy some chocolate?
Patrick: We got him now!
"Blue Fish with purple stripes: Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?"
"Patrick: Hee hee, it tickles!"
"Blue Fish with purple stripes: As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang."
Blue Fish with purple stripes: You can keep that for five bucks.
Patrick: I'll take ten!
SpongeBob: We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob:  Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Patrick:  Huh?
SpongeBob:  Let's shake on it.
Patrick:  Did you say something?
"SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, focus."
Purple Fish: Yes?
"SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars."
Purple Fish: Why is Chubby here staring at me?
Patrick: Focusing.
"Purple Fish:  Back up, Jack!"
Patrick:  Nice place you got in here.
SpongeBob: I can't understand what were doing wrong.
Patrick: I can't understand anything.
"SpongeBob: There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!"
"Patrick:  Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious."
SpongeBob: They are most certainly not delicious!
Patrick:  Not the way I use them!
SpongeBob: Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
"Patrick: Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many."
"SpongeBob:  That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!"
Tom: Chocolate!
"SpongeBob: We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!"
Patrick: The kill!
Mary: Yes?
"SpongeBob: Hello, young lady."
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?
Mary: Mom!
"Mary's Mother:  What, what, what's all the yelling?"
"Mary's Mother: You just can't wait for me to die, can you?"
Mary: They're selling chocolate.
Mary's Mother: Chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
"Mary's Mother: What, what are they selling?"
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: What?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: I can't hear you!
Mary: They're selling chocolates!
Mary's Mother: They're selling chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
"Mary's Mother: Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate."
Mary's Mother: I always hated it!
"SpongeBob: Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for..."
Patrick: You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
"Mary's Mother: Live forever, you say? I'll take one."
"Mary's Mother:  Come on, you lazy Mary!  Start rubbing me with that chocolate!"
Mary:  I hate you.
"SpongeBob: If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!"
Patrick:  Hooray for lying!
SpongeBob: It'll make your hair grow.
Fred: Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
SpongeBob: They'll make you sound smart.
Customer:  I'll take twenty!
Patrick: It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
Patrick 2: Just in time.
SpongeBob: They'll make you fly!
Patrick: You'll fall in love!
SpongeBob: They'll bring world peace!
Patrick: You'll walk through walls!
SpongeBob:  You'll rule the world!
Patrick: This'll be the best lie yet!
"SpongeBob: Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!"
Customer: What can I do for you boys?
"SpongeBob: Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation."
Customer: Really?
Customer: Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
"SpongeBob:  Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding."
"Customer: Ah, some guys have all the luck."
"Customer: I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms."
"Customer: At night,  I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep."
"Customer:  Oh, no..."
Customer:  Ow...
"SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, let's help him!"
"SpongeBob: Careful, put him down gently."
Customer:  Ow...!
"SpongeBob: Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?"
"Customer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars."
"Customer: Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!"
"SpongeBob:  Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to."
"SpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures."
Patrick:  I can live with that.
SpongeBob: Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
Tom: Chocolate!
SpongeBob:  No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Patrick:  No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!
Tom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you...  I'd like to buy all your chocolate.
SpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.
"Patrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money."
Patrick: But what are we going to spend it on?
"Squidward:  Good evening, sir. Table for one, please."
"Server: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party."
"Squidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?"
"Server: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs  and their dates."
"SpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?"
Mary's Mother: What? What did he say?
"French narrator: Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios.  Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch...  the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode!  Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate!"
Potty: Patchy! Patchy! The kids're here.
"Patchy: Wagh!  Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy's private time?  Oh, hello! Dahh!  What are you all doing here?"
Potty: They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!
"Patchy: But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it!"
"Children:  No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!"
"Patchy: But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob."
French narrator: Remembering SpongeBob.
Patchy: I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode.  I never lose anything.
Potty: What about your leg?
"Patchy: Well, yeah, but..."
Potty: And your eye.
"Patchy: Well, the eye, I..."
Potty: And your hand.
"Patchy: And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird!  Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is."
Potty: What is it? Brawk!
Patchy: Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!
Potty: It's a dream come true!
"Patchy:  We gotta go find it, Potty!  Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg.  Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'!"
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy:  Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house.
Mrs. Johnson: Would you boys like some cookies?
"Patchy: Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt."
"Mrs. Johnson: Okay, don't catch a cold."
"Patchy: Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen.  Half a league to the forked tree.  Oh!  Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of Monkey Lagoon?!  Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob!  Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ow!  Ahh... Ahh... Ah!  We made it. We survived the trials. Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode.  Dig it, get it?"
Potty:  You stink.
"Patchy: And I just got out of the shower.  Hey, Potty, I think I hit something.  Clever, bury your treasure above the surface."
Potty: Brawk!
"Patchy:  This is it!  I don't know what it means either...  ...but I got what I came for. Come on, Potty, time's a-wastin'.  Yeah! Popcorn.  Soda.  Pickled garlic.  Hurry Potty, hit the remote!"
Potty:  Brawk!
Patchy:  This is gonna be great.  I can't believe it. More SpongeBob.  This is so exciting!  Here it comes!
Potty: Brawk. Pipe down.
Patchy: That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!
Potty: What a rip.
"Patchy: Grrrrr...  SpongeBob betrayed us!  I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place!  I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it!  All of it!  I'm gonna run away; that's what I'll do, run away!"
"Potty: Sheesh, what a hothead."
"Announcer:  And now, the real Lost Episode."
"Potty: Brawk! Patchy, come back, there's more!"
"Patchy:  Really?  Hooray, let's watch!"
"French narrator: Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action."
"SpongeBob:  Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪  ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪  ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants."
"Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs."
"SpongeBob:  I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine!"
"Patrick: What's that contraption, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is a flying machine."
Patrick:
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
"Patrick: Well, it's like my grandpa used to say."
"Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly...  Hey, I'm not your grandfather!"
"SpongeBob: Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff!"
Patrick: You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
SpongeBob: Don't remind me.
Jenkins:  I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git!
Patrick: We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food!
"SpongeBob: Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?"
Patrick:  Ready!
"SpongeBob:  It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh!"
"SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! Behold."
"Patrick: Oh boy, a birthday party!"
"SpongeBob:  No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board."
"Patrick: Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, get ready to say Eureka!"
Patrick: Okay!
SpongeBob: Go!  It's working! I'm flying!
Cap Fish: Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Nancy: Oh my goodness...
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Cap Fish: He'll fall and break his...
Nancy: Can you see from up there?
"SpongeBob: Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite."
"Lou: Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper!"
"SpongeBob: Local nutcase tries to fly?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!"
Lou: No they didn't.
SpongeBob:  You'll see.
"Monroe: Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom."
Mable: Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.
"Monroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly!"
"Cap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?"
Nancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.
Fred:
"SpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!"
Mother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?
Stubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers.
Nat: We all had dreams.
Nancy: What makes you so special?
Mob: Let's get him!
SpongeBob:  Huh?
"Nat: Good riddance, dreamer!"
"SpongeBob:  Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon."
French narrator:   Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.
"SpongeBob: There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality."
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Mama? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!"
"Monroe:  Mom, look! It's the flying guy!"
"Mable: Wow, I guess he wasn't a lunatic after all."

Mr. Krabs:  SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!
"SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality."

Mr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.
"SpongeBob: You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?"
SpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.
Mr. Krabs: I need you...
SpongeBob:  Yes?
Mr. Krabs: To clean...
SpongeBob: Clean up crime?
Mr. Krabs: My garage.
SpongeBob:  That's your emergency?
"Mr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!"
"SpongeBob:  All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs:  And the recyclables?
"SpongeBob: Aw, shrimp.  Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!"

"SpongeBob: No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish."
Patrick: Suit yourself.
SpongeBob:  Did Patrick just...?  Nah!
"Patchy: Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?"
Potty: Let's watch it again.
"Patchy:  That's a great idea, Potty.  Where's the remote?  Where's the remote?  Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things...  Eh..."
Potty: Brawk!
"Patchy:  My remote!  Thanks, stranger!"
"Mrs. Johnson:  Don't mention it, Patchy!"
"Patchy: Now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind?  No, that's not it.  D'oh! Wrong again."
Potty: Brawk! Let me do it!
"Patchy: No, get away!  That's the light switch! Give me that!"
Potty: Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.
"Patchy: Grrrrr... I hate technology!!  Rewind, darn you."
Potty: Brawk. Failure ahoy.
"Patchy: No!  Stop! Stop! Go back, infernal machine!  Oh no! I've ruined the lost episode! Now it's lost forever!"
Potty: Brawk! Lost forever!
"French narrator: Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds.  Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost."
"Mr. Krabs: C'mon, Mr. Doodles,  we haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money."
"Mr. Krabs: No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy.  What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!"
Squidward:  What?
Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is going on?
"Squidward: We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary."
Squidward: This is all necessary.
Mr. Krabs: Well what's all this useless junk?
"Squidward: That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, then how do you explain that:  a second Krusty Krab??"
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy!"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, ya got me there... but why do we need him?"
"Squidward: This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: All right, get lost, all of ya.  You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving.  Except you. You stay."
"Squidward: Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial."
"Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?"
"SpongeBob:  I'm down here, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, lad?"
SpongeBob: Squidward said I could help by burying myself.
Mr. Krabs: Quit fooling and come on out.  I need you to be in the commercial.
SpongeBob:  Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me!
"Squidward: But, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
"Mr. Krabs:  Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight."
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Tonight?!
"Mr. Krabs: Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot."
Narrator: 3:28 am
"SpongeBob: It's almost on, Gary."
Gary:
"SpongeBob: Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history."
"SpongeBob: Look, Gary! It's on!"
"Pearl: Oh, Jen. I've got a real problem."
"Squidward:  What's your problem, Amy?"
Pearl:  I've got all this money and I don't know what to do with it and I'm hungry.
Pearl:  Who's there?
Squidward:  Where's that coming from?
"Amy and Jen: Yippee, it's Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!"
Amy and Jen: Where are we?
"Mr. Krabs: Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab."
Amy: Did you say Krusty Krab?
"Mr. Krabs: That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!"
Jen: What's a Krabby Patty?
"Mr. Krabs: Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas."
"SpongeBob: THERE I AM, GARY, THERE I AM!"
"Mr. Krabs: We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty."
Amy: I want a Krabby Patty.
"Jen: Me, too."
"Mr. Krabs: How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls?"
Amy &amp; Jen:
"SpongeBob: LOOK, GARY, THERE I AM AGAIN, LOOK!"
"Mr. Krabs: Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today."
All: ♪The Krusty Krab: Come Spend Your Money Here!♪
"SpongeBob: That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed.  Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place."
"Old Man Jenkins: Hey, you!"
"SpongeBob: Top of the morning, oldster."
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! I saw you on TV last night.
"Announcer: New, Bran Flakes. Bold, new taste. Bran Flakes."
SpongeBob: You did?
Old Man Jenkins: Yeah. You were on a commercial.
"SpongeBob: You're right! Wow, he recognized me."
"Old Man Jenkins: Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box."
"SpongeBob:  Weren't you that guy on TV? Yes! I am that guy.  How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I..."
"SpongeBob: Oh, please excuse me, sir."
"Peterson: Oh, that's quite all right, uhh, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for...  Why, sir, I'm flattered."
Peterson: Really? I don't smell anything.
SpongeBob:  You're on your way.
"Fred: Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?"
"SpongeBob: Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?"
Fred: To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.
"SpongeBob: F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him."
"Squidward: There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to..."
"SpongeBob: No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy."
Squidward:  To my tailfin?
"SpongeBob: Yes, I am that guy on TV."
"Tyler: Hey, look!"
"SpongeBob: Please, good people, no photos at work."
Tyler: Here's the ketchup.
"SpongeBob: Well, maybe just one.  Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it."
"Mr. Krabs: There you are, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Yes, pilot."
"Mr. Krabs: I need you to...  ...Ow!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable."
"SpongeBob: I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful."
"Dale: Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?"
Lou: No. How was he?
"Dale: Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit."
SpongeBob:  Solo record!
"Mr. Krabs: So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful."
"SpongeBob: They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby."
"Mr. Krabs: The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy."
"SpongeBob: Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now."
Mr. Krabs: What in blazes are you talking about?
"SpongeBob: Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person! We're on the same page here, aren't we?"
"Mr. Krabs: Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work."
"SpongeBob:  I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm outta here."
"Mr. Krabs: Oooooh, I've never felt such a strange combination of pity and indigestion."
Bill: There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you.
Nazz: Where have you been?
Bill: How long are you going to keep us standing here?
"Squidward: Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?"
"SpongeBob: Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast."
"Squidward: I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting."
"SpongeBob: No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment."
Squidward: Enter-what?
"SpongeBob: How you doing, folks?"
All: HUNGRY!
"SpongeBob: That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy!"
Squidward: Hey!
Bill:  Eating here was your idea!
"SpongeBob: I'd like to call this little number Striped Sweater. ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing...♪"
Bill: WE'RE STARVING!
"SpongeBob: ♪That one... special... sweater...♪  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable."
"Squidward: Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they  CAME HERE FOR?!?!?!"
"SpongeBob: Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy."
Nancy: Is this some kind of joke?
SpongeBob: They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.
"Bill: Oh, now what's he doing?"
"SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!"
Bill: We're losing our appetites!
"SpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer."
All: WE WANT PATTIES!
"SpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!"
All: BOO!
"SpongeBob: Noooooooooo!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted."
Bill: Hey! Finally!
Nancy: That's what we've been waiting for.
"SpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks."
All: Yay!
SpongeBob: You like that?
Bill: It's what we wanted all along.
"SpongeBob:  It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?"
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
Customers: We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!
SpongeBob: Ready for the grand finale?
All: Whoopee! Krabby Patties!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling."
SpongeBob: I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.
Sandy: Laser wrench.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm.
Sandy: Nope.
SpongeBob: Ah.
Sandy: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Mm?
Sandy: Not even close.
SpongeBob:
Sandy: No. No. No.
SpongeBob: Oh!
"Sandy:  Ugh, fine! It'll do."
Sandy: Hm?
SpongeBob: I'll get it!
"Rosy Cheeks: Surprise!  Hi-ya, sis!"
Macadamia:  Howdy!
Hazelnut:  Auntie!
Pistachio:  Sandy!
Sandy: Oh! I didn't expect y'all till tomorrow.
"Rosy Cheeks: I know how much you love your nieces y'know, so I brought 'em a day early."
"Sandy: SpongeBob, this here's my sister, Rosy and my three nieces.  This'n here's Macadamia."
Macadamia:  How do?
Sandy:  Hazelnut.
Hazelnut:  How do?
Sandy:  And little Pistachio.
Pistachio: How d—
"Sandy: Girls, this is my friend, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Aww, what sweet little angels!"
"Rosy Cheeks:  Yeah, angels. Okay, well I gotta skedaddle.  Freedom!"
Sandy:  Doggone it. They're too early! I'm not finished with their present!
"SpongeBob:  Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals until you're done!"
"Sandy:  Thanks, SpongeBob, but there's something I gotta tell you about babysitting my—"
"SpongeBob:  Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy."
SpongeBob:  Excuse me.
Sandy: Y'all mind your Uncle SpongeBob now.
"SpongeBob:  Story time!  Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering."
Macadamia:  Don't waste your breath...
Hazelnut:  And don't make a hassle...
Pistachio:  Some kids like to read...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: But we'd rather wrassle!"
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
"SpongeBob: Now you girls go easy on me, okay?"
Macadamia:  One!
Hazelnut:  Two!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Sandy:  Ugh.  Why don't ya show the girls around town?
SpongeBob: Great idea!  I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!
"SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab!  Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, nieces, eh? And what brings such cute little customers to Bikini Bottom?"
Macadamia: We're visiting Auntie Sandy…
Hazelnut: And we want to sling hash...
Pistachio: A chophouse like this must be...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio:  Loaded with cash!"
"Mr. Krabs: Aww! Go on! No, really. Go on."
"SpongeBob:  This is my coworker-slash-best buddy, Squidward."
Squidward: Ugh! Children.
Macadamia: Ugh! Grown-ups.
Hazelnut: This feller ain't happy.
Pistachio: Just look at his face.
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: We're gonna be sick all over the place!"
SpongeBob: Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.
SpongeBob:
Squidward: Can you stop playing dress-up long enough to make some Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: Huh! Guess that's me all over.
Mr. Krabs:  You two look ridiculerous!
Squidward: Ha! You're your own worst enemy.
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, from now on, babysit off Krusty Krab Property!  And Mr. Squidward, dress like SpongeBob on your own time."
Macadamia: That place really stunk.
Hazelnut: It was lamer than lame.
Pistachio: Take us somewhere fun.
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio:  Or taste Texas pain!"
"SpongeBob: Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot."
"SpongeBob:  Ahh, smell that fresh seawater."
"SpongeBob: Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry."
"SpongeBob:  See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy."
"Macadamia: Hey, Uncle SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob:  Huh?
Hazelnut: Open your eyes!
Pistachio: You're just gonna love...
SpongeBob:  Hm?
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Our sandy surprise!"
Macadamia: It's our gift to you!
"SpongeBob: Well, isn't that sweet!"
Hazelnut: And it won't wash away...!
Pistachio:  'Cause it's made of concrete!
"SpongeBob: Concrete, what?!  Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!"
"Macadamia: So, sorry, Uncle."
Hazelnut: We made it too small...
Pistachio: But we'll get you out...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: With this wrecking ball!"
SpongeBob:  Wrecking what?!
SpongeBob:  Let's all go to my house and take a little break.
"SpongeBob: Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine—  Whoa!"
Patrick: I've been waiting all day to watch your TV!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out."
"Patrick: I forgot how to make it work!  Show me! Show me funny! I wanna see stories! Go, go!  Please!"
SpongeBob:  Boop. There you go.
Patrick:  I don't know how you remember all this technical stuff.
"SpongeBob: Yeah. Patrick, meet Sandy's nieces."
Patrick:  Good to meet ya!
"Squirrel hand puppet:  Hey, kids, know what time it is?  It's nutcrackin' time!"
Patrick:  I love this episode!
"Macadamia: Well, well, what do you know?"
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Patrick is watching our favorite show!"
"SpongeBob: Ah, finally, I can relax.  With work!"
"Patrick: Ah, that's better."
Patrick:  Aww!
Macadamia: Let's launch this goof...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Right to the roof!"
Macadamia:  Lift-off!
Patrick:  Whoo!  Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob:  Who wants brownies?  Heh. I'll go make another batch.
Macadamia: Let's send this nitwit...
Hazelnut: On his way!
Pistachio: Before he ruins our whole dern day!
Macadamia:  Yeah!
Bus driver: All aboard for Glove World!
Patrick: Save me a brownie!
Macadamia: He'll be away...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: The whole dern day!"
Patrick: Hi! I brought some friends.
SpongeBob:  Ooh! I'll have to make more brownies!
Macadamia:  All y'all shoo! You're blocking our view!
"Bikini Bottomites:  Excuse us. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am."
Hazelnut: We're taking that seat...
Pistachio: Right where you sit!
Patrick: What you gonna do?
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Let's wrassle for it!"
TV Announcer: Wrassle match!
"SpongeBob:  Ready, set...wrassle!"
"Patrick: Ooh, brownie!"
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Huh?"
Patrick: You saved me one! Thanks!  Guess I get the TV.
Macadamia: That guy's mean!
Hazelnut: Where's our auntie?!
Pistachio: We gon' leave!
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio:  We want Sandy!"
"Macadamia: Oh, Auntie Sandy, what a terrible place!"
Hazelnut: Everyone was so mean!
Pistachio: Right to our face!
"Sandy:  Aw, don't fret, little ladies. I made a present just for you,  you,  and you."
Macadamia: From a rattlesnake's tail...
Hazelnut: To an armadillo's chest...
Pistachio: Our Auntie Sandy...
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Is the gol'durn best!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Sandy.  I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter."
Sandy:  I tried to tell ya the first rule of babysitting my nieces.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Sandy: Don't babysit my nieces!
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Bye, Auntie Sandy! Bye, Uncle SpongeBob!"
Sandy: Bye-bye! Have a nice trip back to Texas!  Bless their evil little hearts.
"Rosy Cheeks: Ahhh...  Oh, no."
"Macadamia, Hazelnut and Pistachio: Hiya, Ma! Did ya miss us?"
Herb (SpongeBob): Sure is a nice day for a picnic.
Loretta (SpongeBob): Oh Herb! It's like a second honeymoon!
Herb (SpongeBob): Just look at Timmy and Sally throwing the old disc around!
"Timmy (SpongeBob): C'mon and throw it, sis!"
Sally (SpongeBob): I just wanna say I'm gonna be real sad when you go off to college.
"Timmy (SpongeBob): Oh Sally, don't be such a goop! (SpongeBob appears, tears in his eyes) You know... I'll always be your big brother!"
Loretta (SpongeBob): Is it starting to rain?
Herb (SpongeBob): Nothing can spoil this perfect day!
Sally (SpongeBob): What's the matter big brother got something in your eye?
Timmy (SpongeBob): Yeah... that's it... that must be it...
"Sally (SpongeBob): Ha haw, now who's the goof? Just watch out because here it comes!"
"Squidward: Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is..."
"Squidward:  PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!"
Squidward:
Mr. Krabs: I smell something burning.
Squidward: Yeah. Probably my eye.
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop your drama, Squidward."
Squidward: You missed a spot.
"Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally."
"Mr. Krabs: Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive."
"SpongeBob: Like what, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!"
SpongeBob: At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
"Mr. Krabs: Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?"
"SpongeBob: Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete."
Mr. Krabs: Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!"
SpongeBob: Maybe Pete is just tired.
"Mr. Krabs: Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work."
"SpongeBob: Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-"
Mr. Krabs:  No! Not his productivity!
"SpongeBob: Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!"
Mr. Krabs:  No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
Mr. Krabs: Company picnic?
"SpongeBob: See, look! He's already perking up!"
"Mr. Krabs: Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?"
SpongeBob: Definitely!
Squidward:  What's going on in here?
"Mr. Krabs:  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!"
"Plankton: A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea."
Squidward: This is the greatest company picnic ever?
"Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes it is."
"SpongeBob: Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started."
Squidward: Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses."
SpongeBob: Here's one!
"Squidward: Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here."
Mr. Krabs: Right you are! Here's the food!
Squidward:  What?
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around."
"Mr. Krabs: Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: Going long!
"Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho. This is so much fun."
SpongeBob: Is this far enough?
Mr. Krabs: I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
"Mr. Krabs:  Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere."
Squidward: I'm going home.
Mr. Krabs:  Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
Squidward:
"SpongeBob: Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!"
"SpongeBob: Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, This was the greatest..."
Squidward: Do not say it!
Mr. Krabs: The greatest comp...
Squidward: Don't!
Mr. Krabs:  The greatest company picnic ever!
"Mr. Krabs: Well, looks like we've got company."
"SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic."
"Squidward: Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil."
Mr. Krabs:  I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
Mr. Krabs:  Chumpany Picnic? That's not how you spell Company Picnic!
Plankton:  Guess who?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
"Mr. Krabs: Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?"
"Plankton: Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!"
Plankton: Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
SpongeBob:  Aww!
Mr. Krabs: You don't even have any employees!
SpongeBob:  Aww!
Plankton: Sure I do.
"Plankton: Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around."
SpongeBob: A real disk?
"Mr. Krabs: Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!"
SpongeBob: Well. Eh.
Plankton: You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
"SpongeBob: Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?"
"Plankton: Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities."
"Plankton: The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies..."
Squidward: Delicacies?
"Plankton: And of course, the dunking booth!"
Plankton:  Have you seen the calliope?
SpongeBob: Aww!
"Mr. Krabs: Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display..."
"Squidward: One side, Goopy!"
SpongeBob: Yum.
"Mr. Krabs: Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either."
"Plankton: You were saying, Krabs?"
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?"
"SpongeBob: Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure."
Squidward:  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
SpongeBob:  You want me to paint your face?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know."
"SpongeBob: Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost."
Mr. Krabs:  Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
SpongeBob:  Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
Simmy: Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!
"Mr. Krabs: You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?"
SpongeBob: No. Course not.
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you don't want to?
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!"
Mr. Krabs: You sure?
"SpongeBob: 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs: Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!"
Mr. Krabs:  You can never have too many!
Squidward: Whoo!
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squiddie-bird!"
SpongeBob: Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
SpongeBob: It's a paper plate. Whoo!
"SpongeBob: Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me."
"Squidward: I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees..."
"Plankton: Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen."
Mr. Krabs: Ooh!  Me first! Me first!
"Plankton: Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day."
Mr. Krabs: That's such great advice!
"Plankton: This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more!"
"SpongeBob: Ahem! Hello, Plankton!"
Plankton: Uh oh.
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!"
Mr. Krabs: My candied pen!
"SpongeBob:  Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!"
SpongeBob:  No!
SpongeBob: Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
Squidward: I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
Mr. Krabs: Whew! That was a cl...
"Mr. Krabs: You saved me, boy. How did you do it?"
"SpongeBob: I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs."
Plankton: Unbelievable!
Plankton: Uh oh.
SpongeBob:  The greatest company picnic ever!
"Mr. Krabs: Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work!"
"SpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!"
"Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed."
Larry:
SpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!
"SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!"
"Miss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is?"
Patrick: Uh!
"SpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh."
Miss Shell:  Holy smokes!
"Patrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed."
"SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick..."
"Patrick:  Hold on, almost there."
"King Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?"
"SpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants."
"King Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!"
"SpongeBob: But, but..."
"King Neptune: A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook."
"Hot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them."
King Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?
"Hot Dog Vendor:  Uh, he did."
"King Neptune:  It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!"
"Larry: Who, me?"
King Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!
"Larry:  Thanks, I work out."
King Neptune:  Make poses with me!
Larry: Okay!
Larry and King Neptune:  Body slam!
King Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!
"Larry: Nope, that was SpongeBob."
"King Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have."
SpongeBob: Like?
"King Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed."
"SpongeBob: Actually, I've got two."
"King Neptune:  Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six..."
Patrick:  He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune:  Silence!
Patrick: Is it hot in here or what?
"SpongeBob:  Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!"
"King Neptune:  So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!"
Patrick:   Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.
King Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick:   Only two? What are two challenges to someone like Sponge-
King Neptune: Three challenges!
Patrick: Three?   Three challenges is nothing. It might as well be 500 challenges!
King Neptune: Enough!
Patrick: He'll settle for one.
King Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
"King Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him."
"Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!"
SpongeBob: How you feeling?
"Patrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?"
"King Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!"
"Patrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good."
"King Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?"
SpongeBob: I'm ready.
King Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome!
"Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands."
SpongeBob:  May the best man win.
"Mr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!"
"SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge."
"Patrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds. Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!"
SpongeBob:  Once upon a time...
SpongeBob: Perfect!
"King Neptune: I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh."
"Audience:  You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!"
"King Neptune:  Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time!"
"SpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?"
"King Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win."
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis!
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
"King Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?"
"SpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?"
"King Neptune:  No, of course not."
SpongeBob: And my friends?
"King Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill."
"Patrick:  It was nice knowing you, buddy!"
"SpongeBob:  I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too."
Mr. Krabs: I lost me bet!
"King Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!"
SpongeBob: I... I...  I don't wanna go!
King Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.
"SpongeBob:  Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!"
"Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew."
"SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?"
"King Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove!  Haha!"
"SpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?"
"King Neptune:  Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic."
SpongeBob: Gary! What are you doing!?
Gary: Meow.
"SpongeBob: Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!"
Gary: Meow?
"SpongeBob: There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!"
"Gary:  Meow, meow, meow..."
"SpongeBob: What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company!"
"Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!"
"SpongeBob: Is something wrong, Patrick?"
Patrick: SpongeBob! What is that?
SpongeBob: What's what?
Patrick: This!
"SpongeBob:  P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?"
Patrick: Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!
SpongeBob: Good idea!
"Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: I don't know about this!
SpongeBob: What makes you say that?
Patrick: This.
"SpongeBob:  Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Sure do! Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal."
"SpongeBob: Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  Itch!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind!  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching!"
Squidward: SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!
"SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!"
Squidward: SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?
SpongeBob: All what-y?
"Squidward: Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all!"
Squidward: That's no blemish!
SpongeBob: Help… Me!
"Squidward: Oh, I'll help you, alright!"
S.W.A.T. fish #1: S.W.A.T. Team.  We'll be right over!
S.W.A.T. fish #2: Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet.
"S.W.A.T. fish #3: Stop, you fool!  Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician."
"Hazmat physician: Get back! I said, get back! Back I say!"
"SpongeBob: What's going on, Squidward? Help!"
"Squidward:  Here's your change, sir."
"Old Man Jenkins: Oh, why thank you very much, young man."
"Squidward: What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick."
SpongeBob: Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home!
"Scientist: You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up."
"SpongeBob: Where's my snail, Gary?"
Scientist: We've taken care of your pet.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary? Whoa!
"Hazmat Physician: He appears stable, sir."
"Scientist: Alright, boys, let's pack it up."
Patrick: Wow!  Huh? What is this?
SpongeBob: Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!
Patrick: Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this?
"SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!"
"Patrick: Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?"
SpongeBob: Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?
Patrick: I win! I win! I win!
SpongeBob: Patrick?
"Patrick:  Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!"
SpongeBob:  Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.
Patrick: I've got an idea!
"SpongeBob: There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh? Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work!"
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!
"Squidward:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Mr. Krabs: Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…
"Squidward: If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids."
Nathiel Waters:  Ahh.
"Squidward:  Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!"
Mr. Krabs:  What's all the commotion about?
"Unknown Fish:  The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate."
"Mr. Krabs: Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free."
"SpongeBob: Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir."
"Unknown Fish: Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?"
All: We are!
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!
Squidward: No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!
Unknown Fish: Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob:   Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!  NOOOOO!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!"
"Squidward: It's not me, Mr. Krabs!"
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?
"Mr. Krabs: He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!"
Nat Peterson:  Oh! Oh! Me next!
Martha Smith: Where are your manners? It's ladies first!
Patrick: I believe the expression is starfish first.
Unknown Fish: I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!"
Mr. Krabs: Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?
"Unknown Fish: In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive.  I'll take two, please."
Mr. Krabs: Alright!
"SpongeBob: Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'.
"SpongeBob: Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!"
"Mr. Krabs: Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!"
"Johnny:  Salutations, heroic devotees! I hope you're securely seated and sufficiently hydrated, because coming up next, it's the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy marathon!"
SpongeBob:  We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.
Patrick: Let's do this!
"SpongeBob: Okay, how are we on snacks?"
"Patrick: Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through...  the first hour."
SpongeBob: Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?  Check. Drapes?
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Lampshade?
Patrick: Check.
"SpongeBob: Thermometer?  Check. Ukulele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?"
Patrick:  Check.
SpongeBob: And...
Computerized Watch: It's time. It's time. It's time to fight...  evil!
"SpongeBob: It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have..."
"Johnny: For sixty-some-odd years, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have quadruple-handedly kept the sea crime-free.  And in celebration of such longevity, we're kicking off this weekend-long hero fest with the never-before-aired Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Special!  And now, without further fanfare,  the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Spe-"
SpongeBob: No...  NO!  No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now?
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Let us in! We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!
Squidward: Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits.  ...what? Circuit must've blown again.
"SpongeBob: Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward."
"Patrick: Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick."
"Patrick: Thanks for nothing, Squidward."
Squidward: So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans!
"SpongeBob:  We made it!  Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair!"
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Again!
"Barnacle Boy:  Oh, boy."
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Again!
Barnacle Boy: Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?
Patrick: We wanna watch your TV!
"Barnacle Boy: I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else. Our power got knocked out in the storm."
"Patrick: But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret gorinin?"
"SpongeBob: Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!"
"Patrick: ...Yeah, so?"
"SpongeBob: So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?"
Patrick: Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
"SpongeBob: Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started."
"Mermaid Man: You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-"
"Barnacle Boy: Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo."
"Mermaid Man: Oh... right.  Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad,  when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped."
Barnacle Boy: What are you talking about?
Mermaid Man: Huh?
Barnacle Boy: You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!
"Mermaid Man:  ...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach,  when suddenly, I became drowsy.  A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean!  Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast.  But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids.  They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater."
"Barnacle Boy: Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story."
Mermaid Man:  Huh?
"SpongeBob:  Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?"
"Patrick: Yeah, how'd you two meet?"
"Mermaid Man:  Oh, sorry, boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater.  Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered."
"Captain: Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too."
"Young Barnacle Boy: Aye, aye."
"Flashback Mermaid Man: A boy in trouble! I've got to act fast or he'll drown.  Fear not, young man. I'll take care of this."
"Mermaid Man:  I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up."
"SpongeBob:  Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together."
"Barnacle Boy: No, no, no...  The reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life."
Mermaid Man: Oh... yeah.
"Barnacle Boy: Anyway, from that day forward, we became"
"Johnny: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!"
Flashback Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:  A crime in progress!
Banker: Stop! Thief!
"Flashback Barnacle Boy: See if you think this is funny, evildoer.  Who's laughing now, thieving scum?"
"Banker:  Thank you, sir. And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?"
"Flashback Mermaid Man: You can thank me, Mermaid Man."
Man Ray:  You're mine!
"Flashback Barnacle Boy:  How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?"
"Flashback Mermaid Man:  Hello...  So? What are you wearing?  Oh. In that case, can I get a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese? Thanks."
Mermaid Man:  That didn't happen!
"Barnacle Boy: Oh, yes, it did!"
"Mermaid Man: Oh no, it didn't!"
"Barnacle Boy: Oh, ha ha, like you remember. You don't even remember where you live."
Mermaid Man: It didn't happen!
"Johnny:  And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, this is it!"
Johnny: The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here.
"Tim:  Come on, Ernie! The movie's about to start... Where's the popcorn?"
"Ernie:  It's in the microwave, Tim."
"Johnny:  At that very moment in the apartment directly above, a rogue scientist doing tests on radioactive ants knocks over a jar of his infected specimens, one of which, without any hesitation, crawls down one floor and miraculously lands undetected. It viciously bites our soon-to-be superhero. He screams in pain,..."
Ernie: Ahh!
Johnny: ...stumbling backwards.
Tim: What on earth?
"Johnny: In a split-second, both men find themselves in a freefall that sends them squarely through the roof of a vats of acid factory, and into a vat of acid that is tipped over by an errant alien spaceship, carrying the two blindly on a wave of acid during a solar eclipse on a leap year, precariously careening onto a bomb-testing site, where a cataclysmic explosion exposes our heroes in waiting to highly toxic radium gases. Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when..."
"Ernie: Hey, the popcorn's ready!"
Johnny: ...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn.
Tim: Mmmm... I think you overcooked this a little.
"Johnny: Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy."
Tim: I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air.
Ernie: As do I.
Johnny: And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as...  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Defenders of the Deep!
"Barnacle Boy: Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?"
"Mermaid Man: ...No, not really."
"Barnacle Boy: Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys?"
"SpongeBob:  Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!"
Patrick: This is gonna be so super awesome!
SpongeBob: So superhero awesome!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No! Stop! But you're not superhero material! Look at those shoes!
"Patrick: Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. We're all out."
"Patrick: Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip!?"
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Squidward: What are you two morons doing?
SpongeBob: Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.
Squidward: At 3:47 in the morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: In my bedroom?
SpongeBob: We come here every morning.
Squidward: You sneak into my house every morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Patrick: It's our favorite pastime.
"SpongeBob: Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong, Squidward?"
Squidward: Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
SpongeBob and Patrick:  Story time!
"SpongeBob: Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave."
"Squidward: And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--"
French Narrator: 3 hours later...
"Squidward: And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--"
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: --for as long as time shall stand.
"SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?"
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh.
"SpongeBob: Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward."
Squidward: Get out!  Perfect.
"SpongeBob: Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party."
"Squidward: Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start."
"SpongeBob: Oh, this is so neat."
"Patrick: I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob?"
"Squidward: It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in."
Patrick: Let's do it again.
SpongeBob: Let's do it again.
"Patrick: Can we, Squidward?"
Squidward: Huh? What? No! Get out!
SpongeBob: But--
"Squidward: No! You're going out this door, right now--"
"SpongeBob: You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us."
Squidward: Do they have cute sea horses there?
"SpongeBob: Yeah, they're pretty adorable."
Squidward: And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
"SpongeBob: Oh, yeah."
Squidward: Can I come?
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  Ooh—yeah.  Good night, Squidward."
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?"
"Patrick: Uh, new glasses?"
"SpongeBob: No, no. I mean he seems happier."
"Squidward:  Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you!"
Patrick: He's probably happy about his new glasses.
"Squidward: Good morning, SpongeBob.  Honk!"
"SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"Squidward: You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us."
"Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob:  S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
Squidward: I wanted to help you work.
"SpongeBob: What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!
Squidward: How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
Tom: What do you mean?
Squidward: How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke.
"Little Kid Fish:  Mommy, I'm scared."
Squidward: Who wants a free refill?
Mr. Krabs: Did someone just say free?  What's the problem here?
"Little Kid Fish: He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce,  and then he gave me a free hat!"
Mr. Krabs: Free?!  Mr. Squidward!
"Squidward: Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?"
"Squidward: Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties."
"SpongeBob: Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?
"SpongeBob: Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them."
Mr. Krabs: They look okay to me.
SpongeBob: But he's not a real fry cook.
"Mr. Krabs: He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you."
"Squidward: Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month."
"SpongeBob: Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming."
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
"SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: What's wrong with it?
Mr. Krabs: A smiley face with dimples?
SpongeBob:  Dimples? It was him! New Squidward did it.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward?
"Squidward: Yes, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month."
"Patrick:  Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know."
SpongeBob: The guy you're looking for is over there.
Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes?
"Patrick: I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--"
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm?
Patrick: Help me spell 'Squidward'.
SpongeBob: Okay.
"Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house!"
"Squidward: Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake."
Squidward: I love being Employee of the Month.
"SpongeBob: Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy  but me!  Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there."
Patrick: He's too proud.
"SpongeBob: Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal."
"Patrick: Hey, I want to dance funny, too!"
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?
SpongeBob:  What are you talking about?
"Patrick:  Yeah, what's the big idea?  I don't need this aggravation! Why are you still standing here?!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!"
"Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?"
SpongeBob: What is it?
"Sandy: It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around."
"SpongeBob:  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?"
"Sandy:  I'm goin' to the moon, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
"Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you."
"SpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy."
Sandy: I need that drawer.
"SpongeBob: Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?"
"Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways."
"SpongeBob: Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!"
"Sandy: That's the air vent, SpongeBob.  I need that, too."
"SpongeBob: Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?"
Sandy: All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
"SpongeBob:  YEAH!!! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!"
"Sandy:  But this time, just don't touch anything, okay?"
"SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?"
"Sandy: Aww, hush, silly.  This is for harvesting moon rocks."
"SpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting."
"Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens."
"SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!"
"Sandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind."
"SpongeBob:  Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick."
"Patrick:  Hi ya, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?"
"Patrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something."
SpongeBob: A present?
"Patrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?"
"SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy."
"Patrick:  Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!"
"SpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!"
"Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right."
Patrick: Come on!
"SpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!"
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside?
"SpongeBob: We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows."
"Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything."
"Patrick: Look, I'm winning!"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?"
Patrick: WOO-HOO! WINNER! YEAH! HIGH SCORE!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?"
Patrick: I don't know!  But let's see what this does!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should..."
Patrick: I like rockets.
Patrick: More! More!
"SpongeBob: No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go."
"Patrick: Hey, I think this one starts it!"
"SpongeBob: Stop, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here. And I happen to know that that particular button is riiight over here."
Patrick: You started the rocket!
"Sandy:  ...Awwwww, Spongebob..."
"Patrick: Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!"
SpongeBob: Look!  We're in space now! Wee!
"Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!"
"Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?"
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right!
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts.
"Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!"
"SpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick."
Patrick: So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we’ve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought?! I think?
"SpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!"
"Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud."
"SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!"
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
"SpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them. Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis."
Patrick: Wait! What's THAT?  I think I'm gonna be sick.
"SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?"
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No. It's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Twins!
"Patrick: Pardon my French, but get this thing off me!"
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It's awake!
SpongeBob: Let's capture the little phony!
Squidward: Get away from me!
"Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!"
SpongeBob: We don't want your money... moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
"Patrick: Eww, gross."
"SpongeBob: Well, there's plenty more where those came from."
"Mrs. Puff:  SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late?  Whatever this is...  ...it's going on your permanent record!"
"Patrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip."
SpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder.
"Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of..."
"SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy."
Patrick: Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. Hahaha!
Sandy: Aliens? Is that what this is about?  This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot--
"SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!"
Patrick: I didn't even know!
"SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, I got you now."
"Patrick: Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!"
"SpongeBob: Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh..."
"Everyone else: SpongeBob, we aliens would like a word with you!"
"Mr. Krabs: Here they come, lads!"
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: Fantastic.
"Mr. Krabs: Thank you very much, madam.  I feel so alive! ♪Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaree. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard.

There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪"
Squidward: Please don't do that again.
Howard:  I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.
"Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?"
Howard: I'd like to speak to the owner.
Mr. Krabs: Who wants to know?
Howard: Allow me to introduce myself. Howard Blandy: President of the Blandy Franchising Company.
Mr. Krabs: Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you.
"Howard: Get it together, little man."
"Mr. Krabs: Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?"
Howard:  What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?
"Mr. Krabs: Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me."
"Howard: Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there."
Mr. Krabs: Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?
"Howard: Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers."
Mr. Krabs: Do I still get the money?
Howard: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around.
"SpongeBob: What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?"
Mr. Krabs: I'm retiring!
SpongeBob: Retiring?
Mr. Krabs: I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
SpongeBob: I sure am.
"Mr. Krabs: So long, boys."
"SpongeBob: Have fun, Mr. Krabs."
Squidward: Heaven knows I won't.
"Carl: Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager."
SpongeBob: New manager?
Carl: I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday’s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.
SpongeBob: Krabby O'Monday’s?
Carl:  You won't be needing these anymore.  Now here are your new uniforms and here are the...  employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.
"Mr. Krabs:  Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O'Monday’s? Not the name I would've chosen, but that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute. I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon."
"Pearl:  Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year.  Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?"
Mr. Krabs: How's it going?
Pearl: Fine.
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha up to?
Pearl: I'm talking on the phone!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, really?"
Pearl: Really.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
"Pearl: Dad, isn't there something you need to do?"
"Mr. Krabs: Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together."
"Pearl:  Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Get some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted."
"Squidward: Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday’s."
Tyler: It's my birthday.
Squidward: Can I start you off with...
Mother: Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday’s birthday song to my special little man?
"Squidward: Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir..."
"Carl: Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?"
Squidward: Sincere service with a smile?
"Carl: Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources...  ...would you? So, what's our motto again?"
Squidward: Sincere service  with a smile.
Carl: Now you're gettin' it.
"Mr. Krabs:  Morning, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
"Mr. Krabs: Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out."
"SpongeBob:  I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would."
"Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, back to work."
"SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir."
Mr. Krabs: I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
SpongeBob: Aye aye... Eugene.
"Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward."
"Squidward: Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?"
"Mr. Krabs: Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you so happy."
Squidward:  They're watching us.
"Mr. Krabs: That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?"
"Squidward: Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again."
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules."
Squidward: I really think you should look.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Help me?
"Carl: Hey fellas,  what's going on over here?"
"Squidward: Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook."
"Carl: Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter.  Good job, Squidward."
Mr. Krabs: What have you done to the real Squidward?
"Carl: The less you know, Eugene, the better."
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:  Where's the love?
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?"
SpongeBob: I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
"Mr. Krabs: This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a word with..."
Cash Register: Your change is $1.75.
"Mr. Krabs: Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?"
Carl: Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre.
"Mr. Krabs: That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?"
Martha Smith: No.
"Mr. Krabs: See that? Without all your smoke &amp; mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage."
Frank: What'd he say? Garbage?
"Carl: Eugene, you're in violation of your contract."
Mr. Krabs: Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated!
Carl: Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
"Howard: Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?"
"Mr. Krabs: You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt!"
"Carl: Oh, my.  Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?"
Howard:  It's ruined!
Friend: We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it.
Mr. Krabs: I'll buy it for full price.
Friend: Sold. We won't need your contract anymore.  Nice doing business with you.
"Mr. Krabs: Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  Well, we did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends."
"Squidward: Really, Mr. Krabs?"
"Mr. Krabs: No, not really. Get back to work!"
Plankton:
"Karen:  Plankton, is that you? Welcome home, honey."
Plankton:
"Karen: How was your day?  Dear Neptune, Plankton!  What is that smell?!?"
"Plankton: The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure."
Stench:  Failure.
"Plankton: And now, the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench.  Thanks for asking."
"Karen: Well, it smells horrible! You're not coming in here smelling like that!"
Plankton: Hey! What are you—?
Plankton: Stop that at once! You—!
Plankton:  I command you to—!
"Plankton:  Oh, no!"
Karen: There you go. Now. don't you feel better?
"Plankton:  Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside."
Karen: Did I miss a spot?
"Karen: Don't blow a gasket, dear. Today's a special day!"
Plankton:  Special day?
Karen: Yes. We're celebrating your biggest accomplishment ever!
Plankton:  Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
Karen: It has something with you asking a certain someone to spend the rest of her life with you.
Plankton:  What?
Karen:  We each wear rings in memory of this moment.
"Plankton:  Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!"
"Karen: Oh, you selfish, green twit! It's our wedding anniversary!"
"Plankton:  Oh, that.  Yippee."
Karen:  You forgot! And I got you the perfect gift!
Plankton:  The Krabby Patty Formula?!?  How did you get it?!?
Karen: First I went to the Krusty Krab...
"Karen:  One Krabby Patty, please."
Karen:  Thank you.
Squidward:  Whatever.
"Plankton: What? Sorry. I wasn't listening.  Well, you can tell me later."
Karen:  You're not getting this until you get me a gift.
Plankton:
Karen: From your heart.
SpongeBob: And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat.
"Squidward: That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo—"
SpongeBob:  Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
SpongeBob: ...despair.
Squidward: That was probably me.
"SpongeBob: No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over...  this way.  Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?"
Plankton: Wha—? SpongeBob? Ah...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry.  I'm...fine.
SpongeBob: Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob.
"Plankton: Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary."
"SpongeBob: Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?"
"Plankton: Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything."
"SpongeBob:  We've got a  love emergency!  Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency!  Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do. You need to give her a present from  in here."
Plankton: What? Like a kidney?
"SpongeBob: No, from the heart. That's where your love grows."
Plankton: My what?
SpongeBob: Your love.
Plankton: My loove?
SpongeBob: Love.
Plankton: Loop?
SpongeBob: Luh...vuh!
Plankton: Lump.
SpongeBob: Say it with me. L...
Plankton: L...
SpongeBob: ...uhh...
Plankton: ...uhh...
SpongeBob: ...vvvv...
Plankton:  ...vvv...
SpongeBob: Llll...uhhh...vuh!
Plankton: Llll...uhhh...vuh!
"SpongeBob: That's it! You've taken your first steps into the hall of luh-uv. Now, tell me more about your Karen"
"SpongeBob:  So, what's your favorite thing for you and Karen to do together?"
"Plankton: Well, we like to take long walks on the beach, and...uh...we talk about our dreams. Uh...our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation  and to trample our enemies beneath our feet.  Yeah."
"SpongeBob:  Trampling enemies.  Now, tell me about Karen."
"Plankton: Well, she's a Mark II Surplus U.N.I.V.A.C. with 256 gigs of RAM, and...uh...there's the cutest mole on her CPU and the way she processes data. Ah ha. Ooh, mama."
SpongeBob: Does she have any hobbies?
"Plankton: Uh...well, uh...  she does make a lot of beeping sounds."
SpongeBob: Interesting. Does she ever go Ding!?
"Plankton: Now that you mention it, she does go Ding!. At least once a day."
SpongeBob:  Ooh. A music lover. I think we have our solution. You need to serenade her.
Plankton: Who? Me? I can't sing.
"SpongeBob: Not to worry. When you finish, you'll be as  golden voiced as me."
SpongeBob: Repeat after me. ♪Me me me me me me meeeee...♪
Plankton:  ♪Me me me me me me me...♪  ♪...Me me me me me...♪
Plankton:  ♪...me me meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee♪  EEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEE....
Plankton: EEEE! Whew!
"SpongeBob:  Oh, you are ready!"
Plankton: Ready? But what do I sing?
"SpongeBob: Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside."
Plankton: Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?
"SpongeBob: This is it, Plankton."
Plankton: I don't think I'm ready.
"SpongeBob: Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy."
"Plankton: No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it."
"SpongeBob:  Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you.  Ah, love."
Plankton:  Karen?
Karen: Plankton? I don't see any present.
"Plankton: Oh, I have it. It's right here in my kidney... I mean, heart!  Me me me meeee...me me meee...  ♪Oh, my Karen. Oh, my Karen. Oh, my computer wife, Karen.♪  ♪Put down those punch cards.

Karen:  That was so beautiful.
Plankton: You really liked it?
"Karen: I loved it! But not as much as I love you, Plankton."
"Plankton: I l...l...love you, too!  So, can I have my present now?"
"Karen: Of course, my little overlord. Now loading the Krabby Patty Formula..."
SpongeBob: They're such a lovely couple.  The Krabby Patty Formula?!?
"Plankton: Yes! You porous kitchen utensil! By helping me woo my computer wife, you've just doomed the Krusty Krab!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, no! I've got to stop it before it's too late."
Karen: 45% Loaded.
"SpongeBob:  Control, Alt, Delete."
Karen: 55% Loaded.
SpongeBob:  How do ya turn this thing off?!?
Plankton: Get your hand off my wife!
Karen: 65% Loaded.
"SpongeBob:  The plug.  Ha! You lose, Plankton."
"Plankton:  Oh, no. You unplugged the coffee maker, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob:  I am so fired.
Karen: Loading Krabby Patty Formula...
Plankton: Here it comes!
"Karen: Oh, Plankton, you've made me so happy."
Plankton: That's fantastic. Where's that formula?
Karen:  I'm crying. What's going on?
"Plankton: Karen, what's wrong? Have you sprung a leak?"
Karen: No. I'm just so happy that I'm crying with tears of joy.
Plankton: But you're shorting out.
Karen: I'm just--. The Krabby...Patty...Formula...loading...completed.
Plankton: Yes!
SpongeBob: No!
Plankton: No!
"SpongeBob: Yes! I'm saved! Your wife exploded!   Um...happy anniversary, you guys."
Karen: Rebooting... Loading E.M.I.L.P....
Plankton: E.M.I.L.P.? What's E.M.I.L.P.?!?
Karen: Emergency Mother In-Law Program.
"Plankton: Oh, no."
"E.M.I.L.P.: Plankton, what have you done to my daughter?! You made her cry! You know, she could have been with an ATM! Someone with money! But she chose you! I don't know why!"
Narrator: A slow day at the Krusty Krab.
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become..."
Patrick: A one-way ticket to PAIN!
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob:  Heave-ho!
"Mr. Krabs:  What the devil fish is going on out here?!  Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money!  And that's just sick!"
SpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
Mr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?
Squidward: Uhh…
"Mr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your super..."
SpongeBob and Patrick: Superrrr...!
Mr. Krabs: ...special...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...speciallll...!
Mr. Krabs:  ...secret...
SpongeBob and Patrick:  ...seeeeecret...
Mr. Krabs: ...assignment?
"SpongeBob and Patrick:  Assignment?!? I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! Put us out of our misery!"
Mr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
"Mr. Krabs:  But, let me give you two a warning.  This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off.  So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job."
SpongeBob: Patrick?
"Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
"Patrick:  No way, SpongeBob. We're not getting paid to move stuff."
"SpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all."
"Patrick: Well, that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final."
"SpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff."
"Patrick: Good, just don't pay me."
"SpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp."
Patrick: Tarp ahoy!
"SpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about!  Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now."
Patrick: That will never ever come off.
"SpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off."
"Patrick: And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!!"
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, the lid's already off."
Patrick: Oh...  now it's my turn!
"SpongeBob:  I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick."
"Patrick: Well, that was a rip-off."
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go..."
Narrator: One hour later.
SpongeBob:  ...Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall!
Narrator: Two hours later.
SpongeBob:  ...I'm getting to the painting...
Narrator: Three hours later.
Patrick:  Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.
SpongeBob:  No problem. Here I go.  Yeah. Huh?  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?
"Patrick: Oh, I know...  TWO giant paint bubbles!"
SpongeBob: Noooooo!!  Patrick?
"Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger.
Patrick:  Nonsense!
"SpongeBob: Pat, no!!  We did it!  We painted the whole house! And without getting a drop of paint on anything but th--  FLAPPIN' FLOTSAM, WHAT'S THAT!?!?!?!?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?"
Patrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
SpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
"Patrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint."
"SpongeBob: Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it."
"Patrick: Oh, now I see it!"
"SpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon! And when he sees what we did to his first dollar…"
Both:  AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
"Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!"
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick:  Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!
SpongeBob: Did it work?
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: Did it work?
Patrick: Nope.
Patrick:
SpongeBob: Did it work?
Patrick: Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!
SpongeBob:  Nothing's working!
"Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, we're not cavemen!  We have technology!"
SpongeBob: It didn't work.
"Patrick:  This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would..."
"SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet."
"Patrick: I don't see where you're going with this...  Hey, a dollar!"
"SpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick!! No!  PATRICK, NO! WHY DID YOU PUT IT...  AHH! GRAB IT, PAT, GRAB IT! HURRY, HURRY! I...  Aww, Pat, no, no!  GET IT, PAT! GET IT! GET IT, GET IT!  No-o-o-o-oh!"
Patrick:  ...Wanna bite?
"SpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!"
"SpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal."
"SpongeBob:  Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!"
Mr. Krabs: What the…?
"SpongeBob:  We're all done, sir. Everything looks great."
"Patrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you."
"Mr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles."
"SpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going..."
Mr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!
"SpongeBob:  Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!"
"Patrick:  Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!"
Mr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?
"SpongeBob:  It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!"
Patrick:  We didn't do it on purpose!
Both:  Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
Patrick:  I don't want to be butt-less!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar!...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this doll-a-rama were perfectly aligned!"
Doll: Mama.
"Mr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice! Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one."
"SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?"
"SpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around."
Patrick:  Boooooooooooo.
"Mr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly."
"SpongeBob:  No, No, Mr. Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!"
Mr. Krabs:  Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
"SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
Patrick: We're so sorry!
Mr. Krabs:  And then did you draw on it with crayon?!
"Patrick:  I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it?"
"Mr. Krabs: All right, boys! You know what I've got to do now?"
SpongeBob: You mean our butts?
Patrick: Can I use mine one last time?
"Mr. Krabs: There we go, good as new."
"Both:  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!"
"SpongeBob:  Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!"
"Mr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it."
"Mrs. Puff: Have a good summer vacation, I'll see you all next fall!  Well... Hopefully not all of you."
Students: Weee!
Mrs. Puff: Time to vamoose!
"SpongeBob: Oh, Mrs. Puff?"
Mrs. Puff:  Where are my keys!?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!?
Mrs. Puff:  Come on!
SpongeBob: I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff:  I gotta get out of here!  Phew! I lost him.
SpongeBob:  Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?
Mrs. Puff:  Why can't you take a hint?!
SpongeBob: Help!
"Mrs. Puff: Oh dear, of course I'll help."
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!
"Mrs. Puff: Why won't he just let-  Oh no! Not again! If my parole officer finds out, I don't stand a chance! I'll be sentenced for life this time!"
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It would be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if this information were to leak out to the authorities.
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, please, don't tell the police, I'll be a dead man if I get caught! I'll do anything!"
Mr. Krabs: It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you.
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious me, I don't have that kind of cash!"
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry! I think we can work something out.
Mrs. Puff: Huh? You mean we should go out on a date?
"Mr. Krabs: Err... interesting, no, I had something else in mind. Surprise, SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker."
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!
"Mr. Krabs: She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?"
Mrs. Puff:  That's right.
Mr. Krabs: She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?
Mrs. Puff:  Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close.
"SpongeBob: It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?"
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, I got your note alright."
SpongeBob: So what do you think?
"Mrs. Puff: What did I think!? I think it caused me to- Let's just say, it changed my life."
"Mr. Krabs: It certainly has. Now, SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it."
"SpongeBob: Oh, boy! I get to show you the ropes, Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now."
Mrs. Puff: Patience is a virtue.
SpongeBob: Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?
Mrs. Puff: Why don't we just start with my basic duties?
"SpongeBob: Eager to get behind the wheel, eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!"
"Mrs. Puff: There are many like it, but this one is mine."
SpongeBob: Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember: Good Grades.
SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Always follow diligent notes!
"Mrs. Puff: I know, SpongeBob. I taught you that phrase!"
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh, yes! The total key is a bit sticky, so you're gonna have to be forceful, but not too forceful. Get it?"
"Mrs. Puff: Forceful, but not too forceful."
"SpongeBob: You did! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm?"
Mrs. Puff: Fine...
"SpongeBob:  Good day, ma lady, charmed, I'm sure."
"Mrs. Puff: Heh, funny costume, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day."
"Mrs. Puff: Of course, Mr. Féyêdêmuffin. What would you like to eat today?"
"SpongeBob: Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as duke."
Mrs. Puff: You mean to refer to you as Duke?
"Duke: Of course, how else one refer to me? I am a duke after all, now I shall fancy a meal if quite alright with you."
"Mrs. Puff: Okay, duke, what will you have?"
Duke: I shall have... Beans on toast please.
"Mrs. Puff: All right, one beans on toast coming up!"
"SpongeBob: Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast."
Mrs. Puff:  This is just ridiculous! Would you simply explain my duties please?!
"Mr. Krabs: What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?"
"Mrs. Puff: Oh dear... Message received, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs: Just don't let it happen again, Puff."
"SpongeBob: Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!"
"Mrs. Puff: Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I take your order?"
SpongeBob: Yes!
Frankie Billy: One Krabby Patty please?
Mrs. Puff: $1 please. Thank you.
"SpongeBob: Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook."
Mrs. Puff: One Krabby Patty!
"SpongeBob: Oh, Mrs. Puff."
Mrs. Puff: What?
SpongeBob: It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity.
Mrs. Puff: Fine! Here's your written form!
"SpongeBob:  One Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?"
Mrs. Puff: What now?
"SpongeBob: I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although, a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far, student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P, look out for the barrel!"
Mrs. Puff: I'll give your barr-
"SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go, Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though."
Mrs. Puff:  That's it! I don't care anymore! This isn't worth it!  I will not be humiliated any longer!
SpongeBob: Don't forget to read the note!
Mrs. Puff: You! It's because of you I got stuck in this mess!
"Police: Hold it right there! Well, well, well, if it ain't Mrs. Puff. I saw what you did."
Mrs. Puff:  I. You did?
Police: Yeah.
Mrs. Puff:  Oh please! I didn't mean to do it! I swear!
"Police: It's too late for swearing Puff! The evidence is right here.  You littered, now you're going to the stony lonesome."
"Mrs. Puff: Littered? You're absolutely right, officer! Yes! I sure did litter! That's what I did!"
"Police: Yeah, all right. You're under arrest now."
"Mrs. Puff:  No problem, officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!"
"Police: Tell it to the judge, Mrs. Puff!"
"Mrs. Puff: 1 day down, 2,528 to go! That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob! I'm going to enjoy this!"
"Police: Get up, Puff! The judge says you have to go to traffic school."
"Mrs. Puff: Oh, wow! A Driver's Education class! This is just how I made a living except without HIM. Delightful!"
"SpongeBob: Good day, class!"
Mrs. Puff: I must be having a nightmare! What's he doing here?!
"SpongeBob: Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob."
Mrs. Puff:  Get me outta here!
SpongeBob: Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1.
"Patchy: Let's go!  Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should soothe me jangled nerves. At least my in-dash hi-fi still works.  Oh! Me ultra-rare Frampton Comes Alive 8-track destroyed!  And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon!  Who's calling? Yes, Patchy here. Start squawking."
"Potty:  Hey, Patchy, the new SpongeBob cartoon is about to start. Where are you, brawk?"
"Patchy: Stuck on the 101. Be a dear and record it for me, will you?"
"Potty: Oh, I threw out that old Betamax machine in the garbage."
Patchy: You what?!
Patchy: You what?!
Patchy: You what?!
"Potty: Oh, calm down, beardy."
"Patchy: Potty, you know how important this cartoon is to me!  Do you mind? I'm trying to talk to my parrot!  Sorry, Potty. Just some landlubber.  Potty? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Guah. Dropped again.  Curse this traffic!  Oooooh!  Arrrrrrr, home at last. What the...?  Encino... it's gone. No!  You know, kids, this kinda reminds Patchy of an old story. Another story of a lost city. Why don't you check it out? Oh, Encino."
"Patrick: A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, hurry!  How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?"
"Patrick: More like the scrap-heap.  They never come out right! Oh, well, let's try again."
"SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece."
Patrick: I'm ready.
"SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick!"
"Patrick:  Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough."
"SpongeBob: Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo."
Patrick: It's not?
"SpongeBob: No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble."
Patrick: It is?
"SpongeBob: Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate.  ♪The sun must set at the end of every day.♪  ♪And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.♪  ♪And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.♪"
"Patrick: ♪Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese soufflé, it doesn't last all day.♪"
SpongeBob: ♪I will try again...♪
Backup Singers: ♪Try again...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...To blow a bubble...♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...That will last all day.♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble that will last...♪
"Patrick: ♪...All day.♪  Um, SpongeBob?"
"SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!"
Patrick: I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
SpongeBob: Huh?  What have I done!?  We're never gonna get out of here!
Patrick: No!  What happened?
"SpongeBob:  That's what happened, Patrick."
"Patrick: Whoa, what is it? It looks really old."
"SpongeBob:  Antis, what do think that means, Patrick?"
"Patrick: Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors.  SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors, for it is your birthright!"
"SpongeBob:  My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!"
Mr. Krabs:  Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
Security Guard: Whatever you say.
Mr. Krabs:  Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
Old Lady: But I thought it was free Tuesday.
"Mr. Krabs: No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this I hate Mondays shirt."
Old Lady: Good point.
"Mr. Krabs: Enjoy the artifacts!  Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one.  SpongeBob!  Hew, that was a close one."
"Squidward: Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge...  Oh, would you two watch were you're  What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?"
SpongeBob: We were just...
Squidward: You're going to steal it!?
"SpongeBob: No. Squidward, we'd never..."
"Squidward: This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... ...ooooome?! You boobs found the missing half of the Atlantean amulet?"
SpongeBob: What's an Atlantean omelet?
"Squidward: Amulet, not omelet! It's the key to untold riches!"
Mr. Krabs: Did somebody say untold riches!?
"Squidward: Yes, Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds."
Mr. Krabs: Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
"Squidward: For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!"
SpongeBob: Why is this bubble painted on the mural?
Squidward: That's just the oldest living bubble.
"SpongeBob: The oldest living bubble, alive!  Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!"
Patrick: This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
"Squidward: That's just a painting, you quarter-wit!  Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some dumb old bubble pales in comparison to the arts..."
Mr. Krabs: Money!
"Sandy:  And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub, boys?"
Squidward: These two chowderbrains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
"Sandy: The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on, Squidward!"
"Mr. Krabs: Hurry up, Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger."
Patrick:
"SpongeBob: Hoo hoo, yeah, hoo hoo hoo!"
Squidward: The magical path to Atlantis is a van?
Mr. Krabs: Nice hot rod flames!
Patrick:  What's it doing?
"Sandy: Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!"
Squidward: Fabulous decor!
"Mr. Krabs: Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?"
"Robot: Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way."
Mr. Krabs: Bet there's some loose change in here!
"SpongeBob: Ah, so this is what luxury feels like."
"Squidward: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub."
"Robot: Attention, passengers, regretfully, we lack the fuel needed for forward motion."
All: What!?
Mr. Krabs: Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
"Robot: We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song."
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
"Robot: The engine of this vessel is fueled by song. The more you sing of your desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing."
Squidward: Does that make any sense?
"SpongeBob: No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪  ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪   Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪  ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪"
Mr. Krabs: ♪Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.♪
"Plankton: ♪Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done, I plan to make them miiiiine!♪"
"Sandy: ♪Did you all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty!♪  ♪With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!♪"
"Sandy Clone: ♪I bet we can figure out how to make wondrous things, like melons with edible rinds!♪"
"Squidward: ♪As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis, with their glorious aesthetics, I'll copy their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!♪"
"Patrick: ♪I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,♪  I don't know what I like."
"Robot: Warning, you have run out of song fuel."
All:
"Squidward: Hey, look, it's Atlantis."
SpongeBob: Pretty!
All:
Squidward: You dimwits haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
"Mr. Krabs: Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell."
"SpongeBob: Ring for the king, huh?"
"Lord Royal Highness: Welcome to Atlantis. I've been expecting you.  Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord Royal Highness, but my friends call me LRH."
SpongeBob: My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
"LRH: Yes, of course."
Mr. Krabs: What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
"LRH: Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault."
Mr. Krabs: I'm Eugene. I like money.
"LRH: Yes, I can see that. Pleasure to meet you. Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress. I'm so glad you're all here."
"Plankton: They're gone. Now to get to those weapons...  Trapped! Okay, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route!  Ow!"
"LRH: For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world."
"Mr. Krabs:  Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!"
"LRH: But of course, follow me."
"Mr. Krabs: Comin' through, boys!"
"Plankton: These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost.  Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time!"
"Patchy: Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost.  Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed!  Well, enjoy the rest of the show."
"LRH: It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Atlantis. We haven't had visitors in some time. You see, being in a lost city has certain disadvantages which I digress. Now if you follow me, I'll show you some of our grandest achievements..."
"Mr. Krabs: Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else.  Ah hold still, Squidward."
Squidward: You're standing on my neck!
LRH: Are you all right?
"Mr. Krabs: Yeah, but I feel odd."
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
"Mr. Krabs: I'd know that smell anywhere.  Me pockets! They be smelling loot! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
LRH: Those pockets of yours certainly have a nose for treasure.
Mr. Krabs: These are me houndstooth pants.
LRH: What you see here is a glimpse of ancient Atlantean history. Long ago we abandoned our obsession with wealth to focus on the pursuit of knowledge. So help yourselves to as much as you pockets can carry!
"Mr. Krabs: As much as me pockets can carry?! ♪Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!♪  ♪Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!♪"
Fish: Clear!
"Mr. Krabs: ♪I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!♪"
"LRH: Mr. Krabs, we're off to see the bubble, would you care to join us?"
Mr. Krabs: Are you kidding?! I've just got here!
LRH: Very well then. Off we go.
"Patrick: SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?"
"SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh!"
"LRH: Don't dally, lads. You don't wanna be left behind do you?"
"SpongeBob: No, sir."
"Sandy: You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?"
"LRH: Of course, Miss Cheeks, here we are, the combination of all our technology. I give you the Atlantean Hall of Science."
Sandy: Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear!  What does this gizmo do?
"LRH: It's a biomass converting device. It can take any household object--this comb, for example--and turn it into say, ice cream. Would anyone like to try?"
"Both: Oh me, me, me, me, meee, mee!"
LRH: Go ahead!
Both: Yay!
SpongeBob: Comb flavored.
Sandy: What else can it turn things into?
"LRH: Actually it can only turn things into ice cream. We haven't worked out that bug yet but I can show you the most amazing/fantastic device created by Atlantean hands. Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand."
Sandy: How's it work?
LRH: Please have a seat and I'll show you. Now...
"SpongeBob: Hey, cool."
Patrick: Where'd SpongeBob go?
"LRH: Right now, his molecules are being broken down into data which is assembled in this computer and is stored on these tapes, then re-assembled on a much smaller scale..."
SpongeBob: Someone help me!
"LRH: And finally passes through this tube into this tank which contains every living element known to...  Oh, dear heavens! It looks like our scientists were working on a very aggressive case of the sniffles! He could be in trouble."
"Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to help you!"
"Squidward: Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing!  What's going on here? I... Oh no."
"SpongeBob: Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!"
Squidward: Help!
"All: Help, Sandy!"
"Sandy: Sounds like them critters is in trouble!  Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom!  ♪Look out, germs. The end is here, Your days are numbered, 'cause Sandy's here! I'll get these germs, and make 'em pay, with some good old fashioned ka-rah-tay.♪ Hi-yah! ♪If I borrow some elements from the periodic table I can mix up a brew that is sure to disable any virus, bug, or sniffle that steps into my path. And make them feel my mi-cro-sco-pic wrath!♪ Hi-yah!"
"LRH: Well, shall we continue on with the rest of the tour?"
Sandy: Y'all head out without me.
"LRH: Well then, good luck. Have fun. We'll see you at dinner.  Your friend Sandy certainly is an excitable one."
SpongeBob: Quite.
Squidward: Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest.
"Plankton: ♪Oh, what a beautiful sight! Weapons as far as the eye can see. But which one will be right for me? How do I pick? Which one will do the trick? Which is best to guarantee eternal rest? So many weapons! How do I choose? Look at this one with a beautiful fuse! And with this one I couldn't lose. That one will surely give them the blues... And this one here matches my shoes!♪  Come on, Plankton, just pick one and forget about your shoes! Eeny, meeny, minie moe, I pick you, now let's go!"
Squidward: This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?
LRH: Gentlemen? What is art?
"SpongeBob: Oh, oh, I know, I know!"
Squidward: I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
LRH: Not even close!  Art is what happens when you learn to dream.  Go ahead. Dream a little.
SpongeBob: It looks like my front door!
LRH: Behold! The Hall of Arts!
Squidward: Incredible!  The creativity! The artistry!  This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it.
LRH: And you can!
SpongeBob: Whoa!
"Squidward: This place is amazing!  ♪Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend eternity!♪"
"Atlantean: Hey, can you not sing? I'm trying to model here."
Atlantean Painter: Now hold on Nando. Why don't you take five. I'm really diggin' this squid's form.
Squidward: Looks like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!
"SpongeBob: Okay. Bye, Squidward!"
LRH: Now this section of town is known for its advances in the science of fondue cooking.
"SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now?"
"LRH: Do excuse me. Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importantly remember to have fun!"
SpongeBob: There it is Patrick!
Both: The World's Oldest Living Bubble!
"SpongeBob: Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!"
Patrick: Like a delicate air raisin!
"LRH: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner. So I'm just going to leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic. Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full!"
"SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness, sir.  Just look at it, Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look.  Patrick! Get the--"
"Patrick: Oh, golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!"
"SpongeBob: Whoo, that was a close one buddy!"
Patrick: Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlantis-eans!
"SpongeBob: Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen."
Patrick: Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before we leave.
"SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick!"
Both: Cheese!
"SpongeBob:  Patrick, did you hear something?"
Patrick:  A sort of a popping sound?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm.
"LRH: So sorry I'm late. The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?"
Squidward: I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.
"LRH: Absolutely marvelous! And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for?  And Sandra, how did you find our laboratory?"
Sandy: They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!
LRH: Splendid. What does it do?
Sandy: I'll show you.  Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!
"LRH: SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me. How did you enjoy our rarest and most prized possession?"
SpongeBob:  We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!
All: Huh?
LRH: Ahahaha! Come. Enjoy the best Atlantean cuisine has to offer before you leave.
Squidward: What is wrong with you two morons?
SpongeBob: We have to go home now!
Squidward: Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?
"SpongeBob: Because, uh, Gary misses me?"
Patrick: We destroyed your most prized possession!
"LRH:  Ahahaha! If there's one thing we Atlanteans enjoy, it's a healthy dose of dark humor!"
"SpongeBob: It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!"
LRH: Haha. That's not the real bubble. It's just a prop for the tourists. This is the real deal.
Both: Ooh!
LRH:  Summon the Atlantean Royal Guard!  Seize these hostile bubble poppers!
Sandy: Don't just stand there! Move!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you go any faster Sandy?
"Sandy: Maybe, if y'all use your feet!"
Mr. Krabs: Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!
"Sandy: Come on, Patrick!"
SpongeBob:  That tickles!
"Sandy: Hang in there, little buddy!"
LRH: Don't let them get away!
"Patchy:  This is the end of patchy. No water, no food, and still no Encino. And here come the vultures the pick me bones!  Shiver me timbers! It's Potty! I wonder what parrot tastes like... Come back here! Uh-oh. Here come the hallucinations."
"SpongeBob:  Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants.  Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino."
"Patchy: But, Encino is gone."
"SpongeBob: It's not gone, if you believe."
"Patchy: Believe, believe.  Welcome to Encino! It's back!  SpongeBob was right! All I had to do was believe."
"♪You got to believe. It was out of sight. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. The sky above, and the ground below. Bring me back into Encino. It was lost, some time ago, I'm just glad to be back home. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Eencino. You got to believe. Everything's all right.♪"
Baby: Ohh! Ohh!
♪You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to...♪
"Patchy:  Ow! Ow! It was all a hallucination. Encino's still gone!  Oooooo, a sandwich. Potty, you're a lifesaver.  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh, Potty, you know I don't like mayo!  Here, you want some? Go on. Take it. You know, I don't like the mayonnaise, you know. You know, when it gets above 130, 135, it gets kind of grody, you know."
"Plankton:  Cower to me, fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath!  Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath!  Oh, you!  Prepare to taste my wrath!"
Computer: Launch sequence deployed!
Patrick: Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.
"Both: Thanks, Plankton!"
Plankton: Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!
LRH: Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic  replacement for our recently deflated national treasure!   Won't you little fella?
Plankton: I'll destroy all of you--
LRH: Amazing! This is so much better than that dusty old bubble!
Plankton: You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of--  Hey! Can't you read?  No flash photography!
LRH: So nice to meet you all. I hope you have a safe journey back home. And do come back any time.
SpongeBob: So long. And thanks for the tour.
LRH: Dispose of this quickly. We can't survive anymore visitors like these.
"Guard:  Sir, yes, sir!"
LRH: I thought sponges were supposed to make life easier.
"SpongeBob: ♪Goodbye, Atlantis. But we really have to go. Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh! Back to Bikini Bottom! I can hardly wait!♪"
Mr. Krabs: ♪But what about the treasure? It was really great!♪
SpongeBob: ♪I love Bikini Bottom! It's where my Gary is!♪
Sandy: ♪But Atlantis had that science stuff at which I was a whiz!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab. Where I'm happily employed!♪

Squidward: ♪And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation.♪

"Patchy: Pretty good story, eh, kids?  I found Encino.  But, it's all tiny. Somebody must have..."
"Norbluckfive's mother: Sorry, sir. Our son Norbluckfive was messing with his shrink-a-tron again."
"Patchy: No, no, no, no! I want Encino full size again! There's no place like home. There's no place like home."
"Norbluckfive's mother: Okay, hand it over, Norbluckfive.  We'll fix your town, Beardy."
"Patchy: Beardy?  Well, Look's like everything's back to the right size, eh, Potty?  Potty?"
Potty: Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
"Patchy: Ow! Well, kids, I'm a little busy right now, but, be sure to come back real soon for more of your old pal Patchy. Ow! And more SpongeBob SquarePants. Potty, will you get off of me!"
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready for some excitement?
"SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Pearl: We are!"
Mr. Krabs: Who is ready for some fun?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We are!
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?
Patrick and Sandy: We... huh?
Mr. Krabs:  I'm sure you know this charming fellow!  Here's the one that almost got away!  Look at these pile towers of golden green!  Here's how the whole thing started!
"Squidward: That will be $6.75, please."
"Mr. Krabs:  Attention! Attention, all employees of the Krusty Krab! Report immediately to the main office!"
Squidward:
Frankie Billy: Hey! What about my change?
SpongeBob:  You called Mr. Krabs?
"Mr. Krabs: That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab."
Squidward: Hallelujah!
SpongeBob:
"Mr. Krabs: Relax, boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days.  Yesiree, laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob.  Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think, boy?"
SpongeBob:
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob:  Yes! Please!
Mr. Krabs: Great! We'll have some fun!
"Mr. Krabs: Pearl, my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?"
Pearl: You bet your bottom dollar!
Mr. Krabs: Me bottom dollar? Why I never do that!
Pearl:  It's just an expression daddy. I just mean I'm really excited!  Gasp!
SpongeBob:  La la la la la la la la la!
Pearl: Daddy! One of your employees is in the back seat!
SpongeBob:   🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man!  Hey travel buddies!
Pearl: Daddy! I thought this was supposed to be OUR family vacation!?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.
SpongeBob:    Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
"Pearl: You know, SpongeBob. We got an old family tradition of having our guests ride on the floor with the luggage until we leave town!"
SpongeBob:   I will happily honor this family tradition.
Mr. Krabs: See? You two are already having fun together!
Squidward:   And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
Patrick:  Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Did you hear something?
Pearl: Just the sound of this vacation dying!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!"
"SpongeBob:  Um, is time to come up yet?"
"Pearl: Sure, why not? Join the funeral. Super Mega Mall World? Is that where we going?"
Mr. Krabs: Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better!
"SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?"
Mr. Krabs: But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
"Pearl: Holly molly! We're going to Planet Rollercoaster!  But, daddy? W-why aren't we stopping?"
Mr. Krabs:  The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
SpongeBob: Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
"Mr. Krabs:  Bathroom Land! Oh, SpongeBob! You kill me!"
Pearl: Yeah! He's a real chuckle factory.
"Mr. Krabs:  Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!"
Pearl:  Teenage Boy Museum! Teenage Boy Museum!
SpongeBob:  Bathroom! Bathroom!
Mr. Krabs:  Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
Pearl:  Yay! The Teenage Boy Museum!  It was right there!
"Mr. Krabs: Oh... that's okay, honey. We weren't going there anyway. That's where we're going!"
Pearl: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
"Mr. Krabs: Well, laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint!"
Mr. Krabs: Is this the most exciting day in you life?
SpongeBob: Not really.
SpongeBob: Bill?
"Bill: and yes... I am aware of the hilarious irony between my name and my job. Now, I'll be your tour guide for today. This tour will take you through the entire money process."
"Mr. Krabs: You hear that, boy?  The entire money making... process!"
"SpongeBob: Yeah, I...  ...sure did sir!"
Bill:  This just to your right is the first part of the dollar making process.  Where very special sheets of paper are prepped for...
Mr. Krabs: Guah guah guah guah guah!
"SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is staring at us.  Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!"
"Mr. Krabs: Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!"
Bill: Ahem...
Mr. Krabs: Oh!  Uh... uh...
"Bill:  And in this area here to my left, we see the process in which the sheets of silver are pressed into...  ...shiny blank coins which are collected in back of one million pieces for the coining press."
Mr. Krabs: Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of...  silver coins?
Bill: They call...
SpongeBob: Uh oh! I thought this might happen!
Mr. Krabs: Thanks SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us!
Bill:
"SpongeBob: We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs?  Gasp!   Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs: He he he he!
"SpongeBob:  I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change!  Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH!  Watch out, Mr. Krabs!"
Mr. Krabs:  Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours?  Do you believe in love at first sight?
SpongeBob:  Phew... that was close.
Mr. Krabs: I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
"Mr. Krabs: Pretty neat, huh, boy? That's where they...  ...Destroy money!? No!    Noo! Why? Why?"
"SpongeBob:  It's okay, sir. I'm sure I..."
Mr. Krabs:
SpongeBob: Wah oh!
SpongeBob:
Mr. Krabs:
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! It's okay!  The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See?"
Mr. Krabs: It's a miracle!
SpongeBob: Yay!
"Bill:  That is it! I have had enough of your nonsense! Guards, show these good for nothing dawdlers out right now...  Oh, my.  Angry thieving criminals aren't part of this tour. Uh, take whatever you want!"
Skinny Robber: Take care of them!
"Muscular Robber: No problem, boss!"
Mr. Krabs:  Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler!
SpongeBob: That didn't work at all!
Muscular Robber: Grrrr...
Mr. Krabs: Grrrr...
"Mr. Krabs: Good work, boy!"
"SpongeBob: You, too, sir!"
"Bill:  clearly I  misjudged you are both brave citizens and for that, on behalf of the mint I would like to present you both brand new extremely fine limited-run dollar bills with your faces on them."
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Oooooo...
Bill:
SpongeBob: Wow! It's-
Mr. Krabs:  Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
"Pearl: (takes dollars from Mr. Krabs) And I haven't charged you yet for taking me on this terrible vacation. Here's the two dollars I was short on those shoes. I must've maxed out daddy's credit card. (give dollars to clerk, and takes shoes) Yay, shoes!"
Mr. Krabs:  Shoes?
SpongeBob: Oh no...
Mr. Krabs:
"Mr. Krabs: And how was your meal today, ma'am?"
"Sweet Old Lady: Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience."
Sweet Old Lady: I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's the way you want it."
SpongeBob: Wait! I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely."
"Ivy (gray): My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough! Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty."
"Mr. Krabs: Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community."
SpongeBob:  Community!
"Pearl: Oh, I really hope people like it!"
Voice #1: Great!
Voice #2: Super good!
Voice #3: Number 1 with a star!
"SpongeBob: See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing."
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
SpongeBob: Let's see what other nice people are saying.
Dave: What are you shrieking about?
SpongeBob: Nothing! I just love to shriek!
"Mr. Krabs: Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!"
"Dave: When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside! P-Star7. Ouch!"
Mr. Krabs:  Not on my bulletin board!
"Surfer Fish: Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected."
"SpongeBob: Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted."
"SpongeBob: Huh? Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted. Signed, Guybesideu3?"
"SpongeBob: Huh?  Dumb-blurted! LOL!?, What's the Point?, I could make a better patty out of mud?! Where are all these notes coming from?"
"Mr. Krabs: Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!"
Martin: I want to express the worst side of myself!
"Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!"
Squidward: Huh?  Hmm.
SpongeBob: If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
Patrick:  Hello!
Nat Peterson: P-Star7 is my new hero.
"Patrick: Hey, that's me!"
"Harold: Yeah, right."
Fred: He really knows how to complain.
Patrick: But I wasn't com...
Unnamed customer: P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.
"Patrick:  Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse."
"Bubble Bass: You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it real. He's a true hero for our troubled times."
"SpongeBob:  Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em."
"SpongeBob: No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here."
"SpongeBob: No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here."
SpongeBob: Now it's smaller than that one!
"SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward!"
Squidward: Yes?
SpongeBob: Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
"Squidward: Oh, he responded hours ago."
"SpongeBob: Well, why didn't you tell me?"
Squidward: Because I don't care.
"SpongeBob: That's for me! Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139! Cordially, P-Star7."
Bubble Bass: His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.
"SpongeBob: Oh, why did you have to say that?"
"Bubble Bass: You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead.  Signed, HandsomeLad42."
"SpongeBob: You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register."
Sheldon: I brought a bag lunch.
Mr. Krabs: What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
Medley Fishbowl: Why would we buy food from a place that quote  Smells like stinky armpits?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Mr. Krabs: That's not true!
"Medley Fishbowl: Hey, it's on the board."
Bubble Bass: And the board is never wrong.
Mr. Krabs: And does anyone need to buy a pen?
Mr. Krabs: How about some paper?
Patrick: What's wrong?
SpongeBob: It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
"Patrick: Oh, I think they were all good things."
SpongeBob: Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
"Patrick: Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more."
SpongeBob: No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
Patrick:  You were Fry-Banshee?!
SpongeBob: Yeah.
"Patrick: Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves..."
SpongeBob: He said that?!
"Patrick: Oh, not yet!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?"
"Squidward:  I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!"
Mr. Krabs: He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
"Patrick:  No, I'm not."
"SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold."
"Mr. Krabs: Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!"
SpongeBob: You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
Sandals:  You smell!
Gus:  One of your eyes is too big!
Bubble Bass:  Close your mouth when you eat!?
"Pearl: Oh!  This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp! Oh, Daddy!"
"Squidward: Huh?  Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register. P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yokels understand I'm working here? Ironically!"
"Bubble Bass: Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright."
"Squidward: I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!"
"SpongeBob: People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!"
"Mr. Krabs: Okay, that's it! Everybody out!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message."
Mr. Krabs: We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
SpongeBob: A lesson in polite manners.
Squidward: Or we could push him off a cliff.
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward."
"SpongeBob: We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!"
"SpongeBob:  Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy."
"Mr. Krabs:  This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?"
"SpongeBob:  Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower."
Squidward:  I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
Mr. Krabs: Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
SpongeBob: So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
"SpongeBob: Surprise, P-Star7!"
"SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward: Patrick?!"
Mr. Krabs:  I'll tear ya to pieces!
"SpongeBob: Patrick, you're P-Star7?"
"Patrick: Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way."
"SpongeBob: So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth."
"Patrick: Yeah, I think."
"SpongeBob: You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along."
"Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower."
"Squidward:  Oh, ratfish!"
SpongeBob:  Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn?
"Squidward: Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7."
Johnny Elaine: This is a Bikini Bottom News special report.  Perch?
"Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!"
"Dirty Bubble: Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack!"
Police chief: Do what he says!
Perch Perkins:  Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act?
"Dirty Bubble:  Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV?"
"Officer Slugfish: Drop him, airhead!"
Perch Perkins: Yipe!
Officer Johnson:  I got him!
"Dirty Bubble: Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in—"
Police chief: Jail!
Johnny: Six months later...
"Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble."
"Warden: Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean."
"Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down!"
Warden:  Here's the address of your new job.
"Clean Bubble: I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns.  The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place!  Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do?  Greet people at the door? Serve the food?"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail."
"Clean Bubble:  D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something?"
"Mr. Krabs: Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy?"
Clean Bubble: Just call me Sparkles.
"Clean Bubble:  Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean."
Clean Bubble: Ah?
"SpongeBob: Yeah.  Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front."
Clean Bubble:
"SpongeBob: Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob."
"Clean Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh... DB, uh... DB."
"SpongeBob: Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB.  We'll be daily pallies!"
SpongeBob: Whoops.  Back to work!
"Clean Bubble:  Keep it clean, or you'll get mean.  Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!"
"Clean Bubble: Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Oh, I must be cured!"
"Clean Bubble: Wiping up filth, wiping clean every crack!"
"Dirty Bubble: I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back!"
"SpongeBob: Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble?"
Dirty Bubble:
"SpongeBob: Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?"
Dirty Bubble:
SpongeBob: What did you do with DB?
"SpongeBob: DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?"
"Clean Bubble: Yes, SpongeBob, it's me. I'm trying to change my evil ways and stay clean."
"SpongeBob: Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for ya!"
"Mr. Krabs: Now, this new job is very exclusive and very French."
Clean Bubble: Hmm? Ooh-la-la!
Mr. Krabs:  Eau de Toilette!
"Clean Bubble:  Oh, sacre pee-yew!"
Mr. Krabs:  Make it sparkle!
"SpongeBob: Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB.  I will clean them for you. Taupe sweet, mon ami."
"Clean Bubble: Dirt, dirt! Beautiful dirt!"
SpongeBob: Zut alors!  DB?  Incoming!
Dirty Bubble:
Fred: '
"Dirty Bubble: Pow! Hold onto your certy, here comes the dirty!"
"Clean Bubble: Thanks for keeping me clean, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!"
"Elaine: For weeks, SpongeBob worked with DB to stay clean and good!"
Clean Bubble:  Enjoy those patties!
"SpongeBob: Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!"
"Clean Bubble: Thanks to you, SpongeBob, I'll never be dirty again!"
Patrick: Speaking of dirty...  Ew.
"Dirty Bubble:  You want me clean, but I ain't willing! I've gotta be me, by being a villain!"
Patrick:  Aww... That's nice. He found his rainbow!
SpongeBob:  Uh-oh.
"Elaine: The Dirty Bubble has been seen everywhere, defiling dozens of decent denizens with dirty deeds!"
Girl and boy: Clean?
"Pirate: So I said to the scalawag, Listen here, you–"
Chubby sailor: It's time to have tea and cakes!
Sailor #1: Get him!
Family of three: Yay!
Family of three:  Aww.
"Old teacher: Yes, Billy, 2 plus 2 still equals 4."
Old teacher:  Rumpy rumpkins.
"Perch Perkins: Breaking news, the Dirty Bubble just wiped all the teacher's dirty looks right off their faces! Who will be next?"
"Dirty Bubble:  No more pimples, no more bumps, no more news guy's dirty looks!"
"Perch Perkins: Hello– Urrgh, that got in my mouth!"
Dirty Bubble:  Oh!
"SpongeBob: Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!"
"Dirty Bubble: Be gone, hygiene. I'm too big to stay clean!"
SpongeBob:
SpongeBob:
Dirty Bubble:
"SpongeBob:  It's on, now!"
Dirty Bubble:
"SpongeBob:  Help, help, call the cops, call Mr. Krabs, call my mommy!"
"Dirty Bubble: I think, for dessert, I'll eat more dirt!"
SpongeBob: Not Goo Lagoon!
"SpongeBob:  Thank you, my beloved pet Gary, thank you, my big pineapple, and my toolshed, and my mailbox, and Patrick!  Uh, what? Wow. Sometimes I just forget how absorbent I am."
"Dirty Bubble: Wait, what? Ow, just... stop spinning, you sponge! You're stealing my grunge!  Stop that rhyme!"
"Dirty Bubble:  I may be a squirt, but I'm still full of dirt!"
"SpongeBob: Aww, little mini DB is so cute!"
Lady officer: We got him!
"SpongeBob: Every time I wash dishes, I will think of you."
"Dirty Bubble: Hmph. Every time I have nightmares, I'll think of you, too!"
"Lady officer: Thank you, citizen. We'll take it from here."
"SpongeBob:  It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it."
SpongeBob: Just kidding!
Police officers:  Gesundheit!
SpongeBob: Thank you!  You got some schmutz under there.
"Mr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make."
SpongeBob: Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!
"Mr. Krabs:  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!"
Squidward:  How disappointing.
"Mr. Krabs: You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!"
Pearl:  Hello? Daddy?
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows!
"Squidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?"
SpongeBob: No new spatulas?
"Squidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?"
SpongeBob: Right!
"Squidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions."
"SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!"
"Mr. Krabs:  All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl."
"SpongeBob: Hello, pole."
"Pearl:  Hi, guys."
Mr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
"Pearl: Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas."
Mr. Krabs:  I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!
SpongeBob: What's in the box?
Pearl: It's a surprise.
SpongeBob: I like surprises.
"Pearl: Great, then close your eyes."
SpongeBob:  I'm ready!
"Squidward: Well, I like it so far."
Pearl:  Ta-da...  It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself.
"Squidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform."
"SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!"
Squidward: Fish paste.
"Pearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up."
"SpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!"
"Squidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual."
"Pearl: Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too."
Squidward: Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!
"Mr. Krabs:  Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for."
Squidward:  Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Pearl: Squidward is such a barnacle.
SpongeBob: A stick in the sand.
"Pearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style."
SpongeBob: Me? Really?
"Pearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me."
"SpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here."
"Pearl: Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise."
"Pearl:  SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?"
"Squidward:  For what, dare I ask?"
"Pearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, The Krusty Krab has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!"
"Squidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
Pearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?
SpongeBob:  The King Krab?
Pearl:  The Kandy Krab!
SpongeBob:  The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!
Pearl:  Aaah! No!
"SpongeBob: You're right, too scary."
SpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab!
Millie: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
"Fred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?"
Squidward: That's it! I quit!
"Shelia: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out!"
"SpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl."
"Pearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision."
"SpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter."
"Pearl:  SpongeBob, order up!"
SpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.
"Pearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments."
SpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
Pearl: Exactly.
"SpongeBob: All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw."
Nazz: This is so cool!
SpongeBob:  Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?
"Pearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!"
SpongeBob: Uh... right on.
Pearl: Check out this new menu I came up with.
SpongeBob:  Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
"Pearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.  I've got something more fun for you to do anyway."
"Gus: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention!"
"SpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?"
"Mr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy! Have a seat."
"SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem."
Mr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
"SpongeBob:  Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news."
Mr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.
"SpongeBob:  Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!"
"Mr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?"
"SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way."
"Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy!"
SpongeBob: What's it?
Mr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.
"SpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir."
"Mr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office."
"Pearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob: Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?"
"Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob."
"SpongeBob:  How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes."
"Pearl:  Oh, SpongeBob!"
Pearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
"SpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!"
"Pearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?"
SpongeBob:  I got it! I can pretend to  fire you. I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
"Pearl:  Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!"
SpongeBob:  Stop trying to break me in half?
"Pearl:  Deal.  Oh, boy!"
"SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl, I need to have a word with you!"
"Mr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen."
"SpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that..."
"Mr. Krabs:  Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best."
"SpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if..."
"Mr. Krabs: I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!"
"SpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired."
"Pearl: Thanks, SpongeBob.  Come on, gang, the mall awaits!"
"SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!"
"Mr. Krabs:  Oh, Pearly...  Is that a $20?  Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?"
"SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy."
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things.
"Mr. Krabs: That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff?"
"SpongeBob:  Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!"
Gary:  Meow?
Unnamed woman: Grandma! No!
"Plankton:  Get her, Grandma!  I'm the ghost of Plankton! Wooo!  Hey, that gives me an idea.  Hmm, if I were a ghost, I could walk right through the walls of the Krusty Krab and take the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
"Karen:  Ah! All right, that's it! You ruined another movie night with your secret formula garbage.  I'm pulling the plug."
Plankton:  Ah. Let's see. Now all I need to do is invent a...  Ghost extracting machine!
"Plankton:  I look like I just saw a ghost.  Success!  You gotta give up the ghost if you wanna make toast.  What?!  No, no, no! Stupid ghost hands!  What?  What's so funny? Stupid ghost!"
"Flying Dutchman: You are, that's what. You can't just float in on your first day and pick things up.  Here you go.  Oh, grab it.  Grab it! Get it!"
Plankton: I can't grab it!
"Flying Dutchman: I like you, squirt. I got a soft spot in me heart of thieves  I can teach you how to pick things up."
Plankton:  I love you.
"Flying Dutchman: But first, you need to learn the basics of being a ghost."
Flying Dutchman: First lesson... Shape-shifting.  Shape-shifting is one of the easiest things a ghost can do. You just have to think of a horrible thing and poof!  You become it!
"Flying Dutchman:  Now, you try."
Plankton: I did it!
Flying Dutchman:  That's not horrible! What were you thinking?!  Bad ghost! Bad!
"Flying Dutchman: Hmm. Now, that's horrible!"
"Plankton: Now, can you teach me how to pick things up?"
"Flying Dutchman: Not yet.  Next lesson, scaring.  Pay close attention, squirt. This is how you scare someone."
"Plankton: Okay, my turn!  Shh. Someone's coming.  Watch me scare this dummy real good."
"Flying Dutchman: Well, you scared yourself. I guess that counts.  Next lesson.  Haunting houses.  All right, pupil, it's time to apply all you've learned and frighten this guy's legs off."
Plankton: With pleasure.
"Squidward:  Who's there? Ohh, is that you, SpongeBob?"
"Flying Dutchman:  Oooh. Monster mouth with a bucket of ghost goo—very good marks.  Nice haunt, swabby!"
"Squidward:  Oh, what a terrible nightmare. Oh, thanks for being here, Clarry. You'll keep the monsters away."
