We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!,not spongebob,0
Gal Pals! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a Krabby Patty!  Perfect.",not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
The engine needed greasing.,not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Mrs. Puff!  Your boat and trailer just got hitched!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?",not spongebob,0
"This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back.",not spongebob,0
Boo! Who likes eggs?,spongebob,1
"Not now, SpongeBob.  Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary.",spongebob,1
Keep working on it.,not spongebob,0
Here comes our newest member!,not spongebob,0
Gal Pals! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me get your bag.",not spongebob,0
"tents, sleeping bags, sporting equipment, lanterns, pillows, extra blankets, umbrellas, food, a grill, swimwear, and suitcases with extra clothing. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out through all those camping supplies just as the trailer door closed.]",not spongebob,0
Nice and cozy.,spongebob,1
"♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout Gal Pals right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?",not spongebob,0
"Where am I?  Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets.  Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do?  Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive!  Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut.  I've got a lucky peanut!",spongebob,1
Here we are.,not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh, looks like we lost something.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen!",not spongebob,0
"Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend.",not spongebob,0
She must be psychic.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it!  All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!",not spongebob,0
"Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger.  Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, nature always provides.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, where's the newbie?",not spongebob,0
"Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right.",not spongebob,0
"I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes!  Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing.  Hello?  Shell-lo?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?",spongebob,1
"Uh, well, there are a lot of trees.",not spongebob,0
"Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees.  Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars.  Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees...",spongebob,1
"Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Gal Pals,  it's time to initiate our newest member.",not spongebob,0
You are now a Gal Pal.,not spongebob,0
That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?,not spongebob,0
Why would we do that?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, we like you.",not spongebob,0
We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I—,not spongebob,0
Puff! Shh.,not spongebob,0
Who's Slippery Giveth?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night.",not spongebob,0
We don't even remember what the fight was about.,not spongebob,0
It sure was a humdinger of an argument!,not spongebob,0
She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals.,not spongebob,0
Then she just ran off into these woods!,not spongebob,0
"Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge.",not spongebob,0
That's her pendant you're wearing.,not spongebob,0
"Flibberty Gibbet?!  Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?!  Thanks, gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me.",not spongebob,0
Sure you did.,not spongebob,0
You should have seen your face.,not spongebob,0
We got you good!,not spongebob,0
"Mm, Gal Pals.",not spongebob,0
What was that?,not spongebob,0
"'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank.",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.,not spongebob,0
She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.,not spongebob,0
And she did run off into these woods.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, that was all the parts!",not spongebob,0
"Quick, let's hide in the cabin!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right, SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!",not spongebob,0
"There's another tree.  And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works.  Tree, tree, tree, tree.",spongebob,1
"So, SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back.  We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom!  Ooh, what am I saying?",not spongebob,0
Let's scale it down a smidge.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up.",not spongebob,0
"You coming, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark.",not spongebob,0
"Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet!,not spongebob,0
"It's her! Oh, s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!",not spongebob,0
"I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!",not spongebob,0
Let's go!,not spongebob,0
Rawr! Hmm?,spongebob,1
"No, no! SpongeBob! Don't go in!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello.",spongebob,1
"Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Gal Pals.,not spongebob,0
"Wow!  Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it.  Wow!  I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.,not spongebob,0
"Did someone say my name?  Hi, gals!",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet!,not spongebob,0
I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!",spongebob,1
Gal Pals!,not spongebob,0
Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny.  What the...?!  What in Neptune's knickers is this?!,not spongebob,0
"Where's the dude in the boat, man? Where's the dude in the boat?!",not spongebob,0
"Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward.  Well, he's at his post right over the...  Where's me cashier?!  SpongeBob! Where in Poseidon's pantyhose is that sorry excuse for a cashier?!",not spongebob,0
Sorry excuse for a cash-? Ooh! You mean Squidward.,spongebob,1
Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!,not spongebob,0
He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring...  ...complete privacy.,spongebob,1
"Ooh. He requires, privacy does he?  What's all the ruckus?!  Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible!  Are you hurt?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. Thank you for ask-",not spongebob,0
"I wasn't talking to you!  Don't worry, papa's here.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs?  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle!",not spongebob,0
I didn't even know you had ankles.,not spongebob,0
"As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.",not spongebob,0
Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...,not spongebob,0
"It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.",spongebob,1
"Substantial fines?!  You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know.",not spongebob,0
Really? Maybe I should give them a call.,not spongebob,0
"Now now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid!",not spongebob,0
"First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker,  for I am certified.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no no no, don't touch me!  SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure.",spongebob,1
"Ow!  Get away from me!  Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!",not spongebob,0
Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask.,not spongebob,0
Hmm? Anything?,not spongebob,0
"Now if you want anything, just ask.",not spongebob,0
I could sure use a pillow.,not spongebob,0
And one more for my foot.,not spongebob,0
"Well, sure thing.  Okay, if that's all, I'll just get back to me--",not spongebob,0
Fluff it.,not spongebob,0
What did you say?,not spongebob,0
"I said, fluff it.",not spongebob,0
"Fluff my pillow, I'll fluff your pillow.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, I said, uh, will there be anything else, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"No thanks. That should do it.  Oh, Krabsy!",not spongebob,0
What can I do for you?,not spongebob,0
Just one more thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take over for me today.,not spongebob,0
What!? No!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's too bad. It looks like my twisted ankle might become a 'permanent injury.'",not spongebob,0
"Well, that would be an even bigger fine. You just sit back down and relax. We don't want you being injured any further.  That was close. Well, at least the Krusty Krab isn't very busy today.  Of course.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence?  Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?",spongebob,1
It's what criminals wear to bed. Don't worry about that. We don't need to bother those nice folks over at the OWS. We can do our own investigation.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent.",spongebob,1
"Well, no, not exactly, what I mean is...  I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something, and I want you to investigate.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs...",spongebob,1
Shhhh.  You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.,not spongebob,0
"Can do, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help.  Okay, you stand here...  Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun.  And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward.  Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, do what again?  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"Darn, one more time.",spongebob,1
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Krabsy, after tea, I think a full tentacle massage would be an order.",not spongebob,0
I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft...,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....",not spongebob,0
"I'll go get the massage oil now.  Boy, ya got anything?",not spongebob,0
"Not yet, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
I'm waiting!,not spongebob,0
Coming!,not spongebob,0
This just isn't adding up.,spongebob,1
Pudding?,not spongebob,0
"We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you.",spongebob,1
"Um, hello? Anybody here?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, for the love of peat moss.",not spongebob,0
"Anybody at all? Hmm, maybe they're on their lunch bre--",not spongebob,0
"Um, aren't you gonna wash your......",not spongebob,0
How long do I have to keep this up?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's gonna be a long, slow recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles.",not spongebob,0
Office Workers Safety Department. I'm here to investigate the accident.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS?!",not spongebob,0
"He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?",spongebob,1
"Uh, breakfast, green, Finland.",not spongebob,0
"Well I, for one, plan to give him my full cooperation.  Anything I can do, inspector?",not spongebob,0
"So, this is where the accident occurred. Can anyone tell me what happened?",not spongebob,0
"I'll be glad to...  I mean, I can re-live the whole tragic episode, if I must.  It was just another day at the Krusty Krab. I was at the register, giving it a nice shining between orders, when something caught my eye; a patty bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. I wasn't about to stand idly by and allow a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and vitamins. I must replace it with a proper bun!, I said. I dashed into action.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir.",not spongebob,0
What a diligent and charming individual.,not spongebob,0
"That's when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help.  Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I see. As you know, certain penalties are involved...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no...",not spongebob,0
One... Dollar.,not spongebob,0
"No! Why?! Why, why?! Huh?  What's this? Hold on a second. Me video surveillance camera!",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"I forgot. I, uh, um, borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here.  You... f-f-f-f-f-faker! Not to mention you were sleeping on the job!",not spongebob,0
What are you going to do to me?,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna make you pay.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, day!  Ow!  I stubbed my toe!  I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe!  D'oh, that was my favorite shirt.",spongebob,1
"And that was Aja by Eely Dan. Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, Sad Song.",not spongebob,0
That's a sad song!,spongebob,1
"That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me, I get to work with him all day.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, guess what?  Yeah, I'll come back later.",not spongebob,0
"He was a good little Krabby Patty.  I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I----I came to love him!  It just isn't fair!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!",not spongebob,0
But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—,spongebob,1
Krabby Patty nothing!  Krabby Patty nothing!  What now?,not spongebob,0
You yelled at me! You yelled at me!!!,spongebob,1
"All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.",not spongebob,0
And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.,spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
I have no idea.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.",spongebob,1
Au contraire.,not spongebob,0
What's this?,spongebob,1
It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.,not spongebob,0
Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.,spongebob,1
Thousands of tears later...,not spongebob,0
"Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore.",spongebob,1
"Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.",not spongebob,0
Excuse me a minute.,spongebob,1
Star... residence. Patrick speaking.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?",not spongebob,0
"No, I'm still at work.",spongebob,1
How can I help you?,not spongebob,0
Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?,spongebob,1
"Well, of course you can.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, great, thanks, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah.  Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, talk to you later.",not spongebob,0
"All right, see ya.  Okay, it's a bet.",spongebob,1
"Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to...  Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.",not spongebob,0
"Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?",spongebob,1
"Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth.  No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"There's a first time for everything.  Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible.",not spongebob,0
I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry.  I can do this!,spongebob,1
"Do what?  Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob.  Isn't that beautiful?",not spongebob,0
I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.,spongebob,1
"Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?",not spongebob,0
It's...,spongebob,1
Is that a tear I see?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, sunset's over.  Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.",spongebob,1
"Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.",not spongebob,0
Aww. He looks like an angel.,spongebob,1
That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.,not spongebob,0
Yeah...  No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.",not spongebob,0
"Mother, father?",spongebob,1
"Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.",not spongebob,0
"Ohh...  My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
No problem.,not spongebob,0
Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News. Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, let's turn it up.",not spongebob,0
Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"However, he did get down.",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,spongebob,1
"Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no.",spongebob,1
"And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans.",not spongebob,0
"What, what, what?",spongebob,1
They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—,not spongebob,0
"Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?!",spongebob,1
Fine!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, son, I'm late for work.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Dad.",not spongebob,0
I guess I can stay for a few throws.,not spongebob,0
"I love you, Dad.",not spongebob,0
"I love you, son.",not spongebob,0
You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.,spongebob,1
"Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob!  I'm gonna watch it all night!",not spongebob,0
"It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns.  Oh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What would you say to a little music?,not spongebob,0
I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments.,spongebob,1
Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting.,not spongebob,0
"You said something, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I just said, Relax and enjoy the song.",not spongebob,0
"That's a really sad song, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"You're not gonna cry though, are you?",not spongebob,0
"No.  Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed.",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward?",spongebob,1
How about a bedtime story?,not spongebob,0
"Now you're talking!  Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Umm...  How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?,not spongebob,0
That sounds like a very sad story.,spongebob,1
"Oh, very sad. Umm... There once was a little angler  who was, uh, little and sad.  One day the little sad angler was walking through the park.",not spongebob,0
Walking...,spongebob,1
"But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry.  He cried and he cried. And he cried even more.  And he kept crying...  ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.",not spongebob,0
"I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel-- Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on!  ...four, three, two, one!  Midnight!  Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the...",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what a great show.",not spongebob,0
"Well, at least we're still together, little ones.",not spongebob,0
"More popcorn, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No, no. No, no. Please.",not spongebob,0
"Don't be shy now. I made extra.  That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.",spongebob,1
"There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for 2 whole days.",spongebob,1
2 whole days?!?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!",spongebob,1
Tejas!,not spongebob,0
"She won't be back for 1 more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds!",spongebob,1
"Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here.",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
"I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.",spongebob,1
Is Sandy the one I call Mom?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome!",spongebob,1
Wa-hey!,not spongebob,0
"Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be in about...  ...Whoo! Right now!  ♪ Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya! ♪",spongebob,1
NO!  NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SING!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy.",not spongebob,0
"That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy!  First cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...",spongebob,1
"Wow, guys! You two, uh...  Really know how to, uhhh...  throw a party...",not spongebob,0
I knew it! You have been itching to see us!,spongebob,1
"Well, something's making my skin crawl.",not spongebob,0
Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return.,spongebob,1
This is gonna taste so good again.,not spongebob,0
"Dig in, Sandy!  Uh...",spongebob,1
"Looks... tasty, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Are you okay, Sandy?",spongebob,1
I'm fine. My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air.,not spongebob,0
"Uh... hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya a little somethin' somethin'.",spongebob,1
"Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.",not spongebob,0
Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?,spongebob,1
"Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?",spongebob,1
"Rashy sore! I mean, sure!",not spongebob,0
Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?,spongebob,1
"Creepin' critters! Feels like somethin's bitin' me.  I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight!  Hi...yah!  I'll get ya!  SpongeBob, my suitcase! Hurry!  I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea.",not spongebob,0
What's a flea?,spongebob,1
A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'.,not spongebob,0
"Ahahaha, he tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  OWWWW!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"No, but you can use this one right quick.",not spongebob,0
"Ow! Ah, ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah!  Hahaha, connect the dots!  I drawed a horsey!  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?",not spongebob,0
"'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites ya, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.",not spongebob,0
"I've been bit by a vampire flea!  Noooooo! I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening!! Ah, ah!!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick,  there ain't no such thing as vampires.",not spongebob,0
"Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me! Yagh!!!",not spongebob,0
Aah! Gimme that!  Phew!,not spongebob,0
"Nyahh! Oh. Sandy, please. Hellllp meeeee!",spongebob,1
I need this!,not spongebob,0
I need it more.,spongebob,1
Eee!,not spongebob,0
"Yah!  Enough! I will not take this anymore!  Whatcha gonna do now, punks?  Looky, it worked! Phew. I'm glad that's over.",not spongebob,0
"Um, is that what over looks like?",spongebob,1
Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad!  Run!,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
Wah!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!,spongebob,1
Hey!  Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla!  Run again!,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0

"Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, good to see ya.",not spongebob,0
Raah!  Help! Help! Help!,not spongebob,0
"Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.",not spongebob,0
Back off!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay?",spongebob,1
"Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!",not spongebob,0
"It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas and trouble and pain and itching... and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. Soooooo much pain! So much pain.  And as for you. If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.",not spongebob,0
Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did!,spongebob,1
You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship!,not spongebob,0
Stop smudging my helmet!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"WOULD YOU TWO MEN STOP YELLING AT EACH OTHER!!!  WHAT DOES THAT PROVE!!?? IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS, WE GOTTA WORK TOGETHER!",not spongebob,0
"You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ahhhh...  Ahhhhhhhh. Much better.  Whoa!",not spongebob,0
"I do not play games!  Quick! Get in the tree house, it's the only safe place left!  We should be protected here.  Hold on!",not spongebob,0
Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! That's it! Water!,not spongebob,0
Water!,not spongebob,0
"It sure is good to have you back, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!",spongebob,1
"Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged.",spongebob,1
"Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts?  Hey, rain! You better stop that!",not spongebob,0
AAAAAAHHH!!!!!,not spongebob,0
"If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...,spongebob,1
Don't care.,not spongebob,0
"I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain!  Hey,   that gives me an idea.",spongebob,1
What follows is a brief construction montage.,not spongebob,0
We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.,not spongebob,0
"Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!",spongebob,1
"I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!",not spongebob,0
But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.,not spongebob,0
"I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...",not spongebob,0
Join us on the back nine?,not spongebob,0
Just don't let it happen again! Or else.,not spongebob,0
"Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man.",spongebob,1
Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!,not spongebob,0
"Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't want to upset Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Can't wait to lose, huh?  NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and-",spongebob,1
Nice shot.,not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,spongebob,1
Moving my ball.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.",spongebob,1
Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?,not spongebob,0
Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.,not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick, this is just a game.",spongebob,1
"Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.",not spongebob,0
I think you're missing the point.,spongebob,1
"Speaking of m-m-MISSING!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  YES! See if you can top that!",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey.  A pressure-packed shot to be sure.",not spongebob,0
Aw.,not spongebob,0
"Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.",not spongebob,0
"Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.",spongebob,1
Whatever.  AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!,not spongebob,0
"All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.",spongebob,1
Watch out for the water hazard.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.",spongebob,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,not spongebob,0
Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you.  Oops.,spongebob,1
Show-off. I can do that.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, where did our balls go?!",spongebob,1
"Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.",spongebob,1
"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.",not spongebob,0
But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!,spongebob,1
Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!,not spongebob,0
"Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?",spongebob,1
"Okay, okay!",not spongebob,0
Now where is that darn ball?,spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, have you seen my ball?",spongebob,1
Was it a red one?,not spongebob,0
M-hmm.,spongebob,1
It might have been in the kelp salad.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you ate my ball?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, I'll get it.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, no.",spongebob,1
No?,not spongebob,0
"I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?",spongebob,1
I don't know. Got to be around here somewhere.,not spongebob,0
There it is!,spongebob,1
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Play it where it lies.,spongebob,1
Hole in one! Top that!,not spongebob,0
I could do that blindfolded.,spongebob,1
Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!,not spongebob,0
Aha!,spongebob,1
"Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again.",not spongebob,0
Patrick...,spongebob,1
Stop peeking! Hotter.  Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick...!",spongebob,1
AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!,not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,spongebob,1
I was just freshening up. But these fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold! Cold!,not spongebob,0
Would you please get back in the game?,spongebob,1
But I wanted to try his loofah.,not spongebob,0
"Those balls have got to be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.",not spongebob,0
Play it where it lies?,spongebob,1
Play it where it lies.,not spongebob,0
But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?,spongebob,1
"All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you're good to go.",spongebob,1
Fore!  It's all yours.,not spongebob,0
This one's for all the marbles.,spongebob,1
But I thought we weren't betting.,not spongebob,0
"No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game.",spongebob,1
What's going on here?,not spongebob,0
Hole in one!,not spongebob,0
Good morning.,spongebob,1
Sorry we woke you.,not spongebob,0
Wha-What?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?",spongebob,1
"Good game, pal.",not spongebob,0
Rematch next Saturday?,spongebob,1
"Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"This is how to live, isn't it my friend?",spongebob,1
You said it buddy.,not spongebob,0
He's amazing!,not spongebob,0
I'll say!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Who is that guy?,not spongebob,0
That's Larry the Lobster. He's like living large!,not spongebob,0
What's your secret Larry?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you've gotta take risks.  Live on the edge.",not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"And you can't... Uh... You can't...  And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless,  weak,  afraid of their own shadows.  Pathetic!",not spongebob,0
"Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?",not spongebob,0
I'll tell you how: by living each day as if it were their last!,not spongebob,0
How do we do that?,not spongebob,0
"By living like me, Larry.",not spongebob,0
But what's that have...,not spongebob,0
"By living, like Larry.",not spongebob,0
"Living, like Larry.",not spongebob,0
Living like Larry!,not spongebob,0
Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!,not spongebob,0
What's that Pat?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...LIVIN' LIKE LARRY!  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome!,not spongebob,0
"Hey Patrick, where you going?",spongebob,1
To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet!,not spongebob,0
I don't know about this Patrick.,spongebob,1
"You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it!",not spongebob,0
Livin' Like Larry,not spongebob,0
De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry.,spongebob,1
Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, where are we going?",spongebob,1
Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys.,not spongebob,0
"I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger...",spongebob,1
Here's to living like Larry!,not spongebob,0
"Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. Living like Larry doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.",spongebob,1
"Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.",spongebob,1
I see. And that's your final word on the subject?,not spongebob,0
Mmm-hmm.,spongebob,1
I feel sorry for you.,not spongebob,0
I wonder how Patrick's doing with his living like Larry thing.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!,not spongebob,0
"Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?",spongebob,1
Uh-uh.,not spongebob,0
Don't make us come in there kid!,not spongebob,0
"Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen.",spongebob,1
What the?,not spongebob,0
"I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of living in the moment are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did?",spongebob,1
Sure pal. Sure.,not spongebob,0
"By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky?",spongebob,1
He knocked over our motorcycles!,not spongebob,0
"So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry!",spongebob,1
Are you sure about this SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?",spongebob,1
"I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry!",spongebob,1
"Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!",not spongebob,0
Prepare for countdown!,spongebob,1
"I'm proud of them.  Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds!  Wait, don't do it! Stop!",not spongebob,0
3-2-1 Lift off.,spongebob,1
Drat!,not spongebob,0
Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!!,spongebob,1
"Whoooooa!!!  Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look!",not spongebob,0
Uh oh!,not spongebob,0
AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!,not spongebob,0
"What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more.  What would Larry do?",spongebob,1
What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do!  Come here! Come here I said! Hey!,not spongebob,0
"One monster Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
"Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!,spongebob,1
"Uh, One monster Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear Neptune.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
"We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?",spongebob,1
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on.,not spongebob,0
"Well, we better get back to work.",not spongebob,0
Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!,spongebob,1
Use another spatula'r.,not spongebob,0
"WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming, Spat!",spongebob,1
"Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.",spongebob,1
"flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula.]",not spongebob,0
"There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.",not spongebob,0
Go home. Get some rest. We'll try to do everything we can.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Doctor.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who's searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part.",not spongebob,0
Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!,spongebob,1
Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.,spongebob,1
I would give serious consideration to...  a replacement spatula.,not spongebob,0
OW!,spongebob,1
"Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.",not spongebob,0
I'm sorry.,spongebob,1
"Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.",not spongebob,0
"I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?",spongebob,1
Umm...  ...no.,not spongebob,0
How about now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?,spongebob,1
"Everything, huh?  Nice outfit.",not spongebob,0
"Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking?  Ooh, breezy today.",spongebob,1
"Nice outfit, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.",spongebob,1
What's all the lallygagging about?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
This better be good.,not spongebob,0
"Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.",spongebob,1
"Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?",not spongebob,0
"All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma.",spongebob,1
"Well, what can it do?",not spongebob,0
Can it make me famous?,not spongebob,0
Anything you want and more.,spongebob,1
"Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.",spongebob,1
What? Are you going against your commanding officer?,not spongebob,0
"No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.",spongebob,1
"With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact...",spongebob,1
Le Spatula 3000 at your service!,not spongebob,0
"Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job.",spongebob,1
"Uh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?",spongebob,1
"I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!",not spongebob,0
"But, but, I thought we were friends.",spongebob,1
"Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class.  Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook!",not spongebob,0
"Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something.",spongebob,1
"How's that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon.",not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
"Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!",not spongebob,0
"I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!",spongebob,1
I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.",spongebob,1
"Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers.",not spongebob,0
Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...",not spongebob,0
I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone!,spongebob,1
"Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm so sorry.",spongebob,1
"Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary.",not spongebob,0
"Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?!",spongebob,1
&#160;: All that glitters is not gold.,spongebob,1
"Goodbye, best friend!",spongebob,1
"I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.",spongebob,1
One monster Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy.  See you later, Gare.  Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun… together. Okay… …Love you, Gare-bear. Bye.",spongebob,1
"Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru-  Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone.  Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.",not spongebob,0
"Eh?  Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price.  SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay.  Too distraught to even answer the phone.,spongebob,1
"Hello. You've reached SpongeBob and… C'mon Gary.  Meow.  Gary.  The two of us are having too much fun together to answer the phone right now. so, leave the massage and will call you right back. Not as long as we take a break and have fun… together!",not spongebob,0
"My outgoing message is a lie.  Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up…",spongebob,1
"Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon.",spongebob,1
"Well, well, well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.",spongebob,1
"Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.",not spongebob,0
"Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.",not spongebob,0
"You're the best, Mr. Krabs!  Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
"Wow, Dad, is it really mine to keep?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely.  And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.",not spongebob,0
"Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.",spongebob,1
"Hey, thanks, Dad.",not spongebob,0
They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!,spongebob,1
You wish to have one of my rare and extremely dangerous… huh?,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, this is the one.",spongebob,1
"Beware, boy, this is no ordinary pet!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!",spongebob,1
You must to understand. These pets can be very unstable. especially around other pets!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye.",spongebob,1
Why bother? They never listen.,not spongebob,0
"Sheriff, I've caught the bank robber.  There's your culprit right here. Now cuff him.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I've brought you a surprise.  Your very own play pal.  His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back.",spongebob,1
"Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here, you.  There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas.",spongebob,1
"Done!  Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot!  Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends.  Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond.  Great, now my enchiladas are cold.",spongebob,1
"Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?!  Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight.  I hope you're happy now.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend.  Aww, look at you two so cute together.",spongebob,1
Meooooooow.,not spongebob,0
"I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.",spongebob,1
"Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Gary! Shame on you!  Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless.  See? There he is, fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please?  Good night.",spongebob,1

Phew.  Meow!,not spongebob,0
Oooow! Mah!,not spongebob,0
Mah!,not spongebob,0
"Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along!  Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh, well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. Whoa!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right, Gary, you have left me no choice!",spongebob,1
"Gary!  You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary!  Bad! Bad! Bad boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad!  I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh, hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy?  What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt.",spongebob,1
MEOW!,not spongebob,0
This is exactly what I was talking about--,spongebob,1
"Fluffy! Fluffy, wait!  Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?",spongebob,1
"Ah, this is more like it. From now on, I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home.",spongebob,1
What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out.",spongebob,1
"Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so?  Serve ‘em up, snail!",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!,spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"It's part two of the two-part special, The Case of the Curious Cliff Hanger. Well, I've rearranged the living room for optimal TV viewing.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
The popcorn's a-popping.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"And the soda's on ice. All that's left is to set the VCR to record  so I can relive the magic over and over forever.  Hmm, but which tape to use? Don't have any blank ones left. Hmm.  Oh, here we go. Who needs a tape of their own birth, anyway?  Yoop, done!  Now it's just one quick shift at the Krusty Krab, and I'll be back for the evening's entertainment.",spongebob,1
"Normally I like working, but today is moving  so slowly.",spongebob,1
"Oh, at this rate I'm never gonna see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.",spongebob,1
Hmm?,spongebob,1
"We'll help you get through the day, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
And tonight we'll conquer evil!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, you guys always make me feel better.  Hmm?",spongebob,1
One Shift Later...,not spongebob,0
"All right, bye, Squidward! Bye, Mr. Krabs!  See you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob. My boat has a flat tire. Could you help me change it?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, well,  I gotta get home for Mermaid Man, but—but sure, I guess I have a little time.",spongebob,1
"Oh, good. Let me know when you're done.",not spongebob,0
"Luckily, I brought all my tools.  Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer— Whoa!  Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!",spongebob,1
Gotta get that old tire off. And...  Yes? No. Maybe if I try...,spongebob,1
Hmm. Ah-ha!,spongebob,1
"Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go.",spongebob,1
"Thanks again, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
"Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace.  Ah, home sweet pineapple!",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy! You got a minute?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, not really, but—",spongebob,1
"I double-parked my rock, and it got towed.  Could you help me get it back?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. Mermaid Man is on soon.",spongebob,1
You'se guys can take a look around on your owns.,not spongebob,0
"They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, buddy. I'll know it when I feel it. Oh, this might be it! Give me a hand!",not spongebob,0
"Ow! No, this isn't it. Oh, ooh, this one might be it!",not spongebob,0
"Ouch! No, this isn't it either. Ow! No. Ow! No.  No.  No.",not spongebob,0
This is it. This is my rock!,not spongebob,0
Congratulations. Now there's a little matter of the fee.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, talk to him.",not spongebob,0
Here you go.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob! See you at home for Mermaid Man! Whoo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. I could really use your help.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause Mermaid Man is on and it's the lost episode—",spongebob,1
"Oh, it won't take more than a minute.",not spongebob,0
My laser acorn experiment blasted a nut-sized hole in my dome. Could you stick your finger here while I go get my fix-it-up kit?,not spongebob,0
I don't really have a lot of time to—,spongebob,1
"Thanks, be right back!",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I can't wait to see that long lost Mermaid Man episode tonight.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, for sure. No real fan would miss it. Not for the world.",not spongebob,0
"All righty, SpongeBob. I'm ready to—What?",not spongebob,0
That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna—,spongebob,1
"Boy-o, you gotta help me sort me loose change!",not spongebob,0
But Mermaid Man.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it!  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.,spongebob,1
"Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, Mermaid Man!  Oh.  Where'd I put my keys?  Did I leave them on the table again?  No, my tape!  My soda!  My popcorn!  My Mermaid Man!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, SpongeBob. Why all the waterworks?",not spongebob,0
I was so busy helping everyone that I missed Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!,spongebob,1
they took his kindness for granted and inexplicably ruined his chances of seeing the episode he's been looking forward to watching.],not spongebob,0
"All right, listen up. SpongeBob has helped every single one of us dozens of times over. But we ain't been very helpful to him today.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I was a lousy friend.",not spongebob,0
"Now, we may have taken advantage of his kindness, but I got a plan to make things right.",not spongebob,0
The Next Day...,not spongebob,0
Play…,spongebob,1
"Hey there, SpongeBob. Feeling any better?",not spongebob,0
"Aww,  why don't you come with me? I have a little surprise for you.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not really in the mood, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Aww, quit acting like a calf with colic.  Come on, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?",spongebob,1
Don't worry about that. Just sit right here and enjoy the play.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay.",spongebob,1
"Welcome, ladies and morons! It's time for the exciting conclusion to... The Case of the Curious Cliffhanger!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Whoa!,spongebob,1

"What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.",spongebob,1
"Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well.",not spongebob,0
Yes?!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?",spongebob,1
So what?,not spongebob,0
How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?,spongebob,1
I hear you crying all the time.,not spongebob,0
"Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.",spongebob,1
"Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please.  Okay... can someone else take my order?",not spongebob,0
I'll wait.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.",spongebob,1
Really? Do you think you can?,not spongebob,0
No problem.,spongebob,1
"Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay.",not spongebob,0
"You love music, right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Mmm hmm.,not spongebob,0
Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!,spongebob,1
"Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!",not spongebob,0
See? Your happiest memory is forming!,spongebob,1
Oops. That was a sour note.,spongebob,1
This is not my happiest memory...,not spongebob,0
Why are we at the Art Museum?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!",spongebob,1
Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?,not spongebob,0
"Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece!",not spongebob,0
Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!,spongebob,1
Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!,not spongebob,0
Your happiest memory?,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece,not spongebob,0
Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!,not spongebob,0
Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light...  of my flamethrower!,not spongebob,0
And now he's melted it...  Not a happiest memory...,not spongebob,0
Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!,spongebob,1
What a majestic view!,spongebob,1
What view?,not spongebob,0
Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?,spongebob,1
Very nice... except that I'm  afraid of heights!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down!,spongebob,1
What?! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...,not spongebob,0
Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here!  You plant it!  All that time and money and resources wasted on...,not spongebob,0
Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!,spongebob,1
Uh oh...,not spongebob,0
Stupid amateurs...  Fantastic...,not spongebob,0
"Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead...",not spongebob,0
Two weeks later...,not spongebob,0
"Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!",spongebob,1
Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!,spongebob,1
Meow...,not spongebob,0
Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? Hello!?  Hello?",spongebob,1
"I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?",spongebob,1
Yes...  Thanks for stopping by.,not spongebob,0
Sigh... meow.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!",spongebob,1
I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
I have a package for a Squidward Tentaclees?,not spongebob,0
Tentacles. Yes that's me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, here you go.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  Gotcha! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!?",not spongebob,0
"Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?",spongebob,1
You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... want... a... happiest memory!,not spongebob,0
So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?,spongebob,1
"I feel wonderful!  This is it, my happiest memory!",not spongebob,0
Sigh... he's so handsome!,spongebob,1
"Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!",not spongebob,0
"Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!",spongebob,1
"Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.",spongebob,1
What's this? Where are the doubloons?,not spongebob,0
"There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt.",spongebob,1
Based on a real treasure map.,not spongebob,0
Take a break and play around with us.,spongebob,1
"Yeah! C'mon, sweaty!",not spongebob,0
Have you finished cleaning the tables?,not spongebob,0
"I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?",not spongebob,0
I already took care of it.,spongebob,1
"Hahaha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.",not spongebob,0
"My turn!  Five!  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm...  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're fired.",not spongebob,0
But I don't even work here!,not spongebob,0
"Would you like a job, starting now?",not spongebob,0
"Boy, would I!",not spongebob,0
You're fired.,not spongebob,0
"My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.",spongebob,1
Shiver me timbers!,not spongebob,0
"Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.",not spongebob,0
"You are a real pirate. Go straight to the X that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.",spongebob,1
"Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one--   Help! Help!  My leg!",not spongebob,0
Can't you see we're closed?!  Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.",not spongebob,0
"I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you can't walk out on me now.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?",spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you gotta...!",spongebob,1
"Tread softly, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs...",spongebob,1
"I'll roll for you, boy.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr...",spongebob,1
"Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr...",spongebob,1
"One, two, three...",not spongebob,0
"MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?",spongebob,1
"A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? Though it is treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.",not spongebob,0
Pirates?,spongebob,1
"Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?",not spongebob,0
"Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!",not spongebob,0
"Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!",spongebob,1
"Now, don't you feel more like pirates?",not spongebob,0
"Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!",spongebob,1
And I'm BlindBeard the Pirate!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,spongebob,1
"Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.",not spongebob,0
Really? Can we see the map?,spongebob,1
Uh... no. Only the captain can lay eyes on the map!,not spongebob,0
"Okie dokie, then!",spongebob,1
"Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, okie dokie, then! A pirate says, arrgh!",not spongebob,0
"Okie... oops.  I mean...  ARRGH, Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH...",spongebob,1
"Out with it man, ARRGH!",not spongebob,0
"I, ARRGH, think, ARRGH, he's trying, ARRGH, to say--  land.",not spongebob,0
"AAAARRGH!!! From now on, only the captain says 'arrgh'! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?",not spongebob,0
"The whole ship is underwater, captain.",spongebob,1
"Arrgh. We're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot.  This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, cap'n?",spongebob,1
"Ensign Patrick, which way is east?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh...  let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!",not spongebob,0
"9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the X? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east!",not spongebob,0
"Ohhhh, east? I thought you said weast.",not spongebob,0
Weast? What kind of compass are you reading lad?,not spongebob,0
"This one, sir.",not spongebob,0
"That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, we're tired.",spongebob,1
And hungry.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just a... bunch of sand!",not spongebob,0
"Don't cry, Captain Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.",spongebob,1
You'll stay with me then?,not spongebob,0
We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!,not spongebob,0
I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!,not spongebob,0
And all for one!,not spongebob,0
"I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.",spongebob,1
"I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks!",not spongebob,0
But we've only been gone a few hours!,spongebob,1
"...I know, hehehehe.",not spongebob,0
"I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!",spongebob,1
Captain Krabs?,not spongebob,0
He's not here.,spongebob,1
Look! The treasure map.,not spongebob,0
"Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Yeah...,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
Nothing.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.",spongebob,1
"I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?",not spongebob,0
"No, guess there isn't.  Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself!",spongebob,1
"THE MAP! THE MAP! GOTTA SEE IT, GOTTA LOOK AT IT!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
Did you notice something familiar about this map?,not spongebob,0
"You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?",spongebob,1
Do you think this is a problem?,not spongebob,0
Ahh! Mr. Krabs!!,not spongebob,0
Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?,not spongebob,0
We're sorry!,not spongebob,0
"That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?",not spongebob,0
"Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!",spongebob,1
I think that.,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!,not spongebob,0
Look! It's the X.,spongebob,1
X marks the spot!,not spongebob,0
Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!,spongebob,1
"Well, what are you waiting for, lads?  Dig! Dig!  Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!",not spongebob,0
"We got it, Captain Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha! Hand it up to me, lads! Heave!  We finally found it!",not spongebob,0
The Dutchman's Treasure!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!,not spongebob,0
We found it together. So we deserve a share!,spongebob,1
"Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!",not spongebob,0
What about loyalty?,spongebob,1
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,spongebob,1
All for one!,not spongebob,0
And one for all!,spongebob,1
All for one!!,not spongebob,0
And one for all!!,spongebob,1
I'm the Flying Dutchman...,not spongebob,0
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,spongebob,1
"I'm the Flying Dutchman...  WHO DARES WAKE THE FLYING DUTCHMAN?! Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,not spongebob,0
Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure???,not spongebob,0
They did!,not spongebob,0
Arrgh!  So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Two gold doubloons!,not spongebob,0
Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.",not spongebob,0
"Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!  Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!",not spongebob,0
Plastic!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!",not spongebob,0
"Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.",not spongebob,0
"Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer!  Welcome to art class!!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry...",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!,not spongebob,0
"This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?",spongebob,1
You're looking at him.,not spongebob,0
"You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.",spongebob,1
Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.,not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.",spongebob,1
"So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, please.",spongebob,1
"Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.",not spongebob,0
I have no talent.,spongebob,1
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.,spongebob,1
"If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me.",not spongebob,0
"If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.",spongebob,1
"Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say  circle one.  Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"How's this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.,not spongebob,0
"Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.",spongebob,1
Gimme that.  Forget the circles.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.",spongebob,1
"Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog!  What are you doing, now?",not spongebob,0
"I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time...",spongebob,1
"Do you want to learn art, or not?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.",spongebob,1
"Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently...",not spongebob,0
How's this Squidward?,spongebob,1
"It's beautiful.  I mean... this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!",spongebob,1
"Hello, there!",not spongebob,0
"But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!",spongebob,1
"Good day, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.",not spongebob,0
The world famous art collector?,not spongebob,0
The one and only.,not spongebob,0
"Well, what are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.,not spongebob,0
Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: Squidward en repose.,not spongebob,0
"I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.",not spongebob,0
Why not?,not spongebob,0
Because. It's an art collection!,not spongebob,0
How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.,not spongebob,0
More like: Belongs in the Trash!,not spongebob,0
Sorry. I must've missed that one.,not spongebob,0
Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...",not spongebob,0
"Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw.  Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...",not spongebob,0
Fame!,not spongebob,0
...fortune...,not spongebob,0
Fortune!,not spongebob,0
...anything his heart desires!,not spongebob,0
Anything?!?!  It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!,not spongebob,0
"I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.",not spongebob,0
I could use a little help.  My fame! My fortune! My hair!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.",not spongebob,0
"Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye.  I gotta find SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?",not spongebob,0
"Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.",spongebob,1
"Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.",not spongebob,0
Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them.,spongebob,1
"Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.",not spongebob,0

I... can't!,spongebob,1
"Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!",not spongebob,0
"I did it, Squidward.",spongebob,1

"Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it!  There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da!",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.",not spongebob,0
"First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.",spongebob,1
Now you've got it.,not spongebob,0
I've gotta embrace the marble!,spongebob,1
Right.,not spongebob,0
I've gotta sniff the marble!,spongebob,1
"Well, uh, okay.",not spongebob,0
I've gotta lick the marble!,spongebob,1
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.,spongebob,1

"With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy...",not spongebob,0
"But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.

Are you getting hungry?,spongebob,1

I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us.,spongebob,1
That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though.,not spongebob,0
It couldn't?,spongebob,1
Nope. I had its vocal cords removed before the trip.,not spongebob,0

"Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, but it looks like everything worked out just... fine...",not spongebob,0

It sounded like it came from the other side of this big rock!,not spongebob,0
"This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall!)",spongebob,1
Do you think it belongs to that gift shop right there?,not spongebob,0
What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere?,spongebob,1

"Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff!  You gonna buy something?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not in the market for any souvenirs.",not spongebob,0

Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!,not spongebob,0
Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic  replacement for our recently deflated national treasure!   Won't you little fella?,not spongebob,0

I'm not sure how to respond to that.,not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!,spongebob,1
"Hey! We're stuck here, remember?",not spongebob,0
Why is that?,not spongebob,0
Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left. See?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, heroes! Is there anything we can do?  That's a heavy piece of nothing...  So, is that it?",spongebob,1
"Yes. Uh, thank you, boys. We don't usually do this, but in term for pushing the invisiboat up all those hills, there's something I'd like you to see. But you must promise to not touch anything.",not spongebob,0
Okay!  Wow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582! Man Ray's power glove!",spongebob,1

What went wrong?,not spongebob,0
"Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man, what happened to the tartar sauce?",not spongebob,0
Good thing that was around. I was starving.,not spongebob,0
Curious. Could I have forgotten to refill it?,not spongebob,0

I don't got time for that!,not spongebob,0

"Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time. Hello, fellow citizen.  Hello, Squilliam.",spongebob,1
Man Ray is great.,not spongebob,0
Yeah.  Must be taking care of his community service obligations.,spongebob,1
That'll teach him to jaywalk.,not spongebob,0
"Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city?",spongebob,1
"Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the clatter of prison chains.",not spongebob,0
"I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?",spongebob,1
No. But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard!  It's missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!,not spongebob,0
"Even worse than that, Patrick. The police got new uniforms!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! What did they do with those old ones?!",not spongebob,0
"And yikes! What happened to the Krusty Krab?!  The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?",spongebob,1
I’m all out of Man Ray dollars?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past. And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler. Oh, we got to do something.",spongebob,1
But what?,not spongebob,0
What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis. See if I still have a job!,spongebob,1
"Hey, you’re not eating fast enough!",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, Squidw...",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here?,spongebob,1
Just getting stuck in a wasted life.,not spongebob,0
Order up!,not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man! He's wearing a hairnet!  What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?",spongebob,1
"I lost the desire and the physique to fight long ago, kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you're my age.",not spongebob,0
"What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight.",spongebob,1
"You got spaghetti for brains, kid? We are the younger ones. The older ones...  Bless their souls... have been immortalized in this very restaurant.",not spongebob,0
I am so sorry for your loss of... yourself.,spongebob,1
"I hate to break up the memorial service, but we're out of tartar sauce out here.",not spongebob,0
"Tartar sauce?! The topping that destroyed life as we knew it! If only my tartar sauce attack hadn't failed that day, we wouldn't be living in this wasteland! We're already out?",not spongebob,0
Yep. Chewy bits...,not spongebob,0
"I knew I recognize you from somewhere, you were there. And you ate that tartar sauce on that day! Do you realize what you’ve done?!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mermaid Man. We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help, of course.",spongebob,1
"I'm not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had me by the neck! Oh, e-evil!",not spongebob,0
Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?,spongebob,1
"Barnacles, no! It means he put this electro-collar on me that won't allow me to leave the restaurant!",not spongebob,0
Oh. Let's get the nasty thing off of you.,spongebob,1
Haven't you two idiots done enough damage?,not spongebob,0
"I can't get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?",spongebob,1
Keep away from me!,not spongebob,0
Ta-daaa! You're free! Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?,spongebob,1
"I suppose you’ve proven your medal, kid. But I'll have my eye on you two. Now let's pop that Dirty Bubble!",not spongebob,0
"Actually, we're fighting Man Ray.",spongebob,1
"Oh. Well, in that case, let the lighthouse of justice shine on Ray Man!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I suppose that's close enough. Back to the past, gents, just stop you from eating the tartar sauce again for the first time. Hmm.",not spongebob,0
I am ready to rule the world and its riches!,not spongebob,0
"Not so fast, Man Ray!",not spongebob,0
We've got a little surprise for you.,not spongebob,0
Keep your tongue out of the tartar sauce!,not spongebob,0
Impostors!,not spongebob,0
"Who are you calling impostor, impostor? I must prevent our tartar sauce from being eaten by that fool!",not spongebob,0
If I want to get near my tartar sauce I gotta to go through me first!,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna make me eat those words!,not spongebob,0
Bring it.  Take this!  I’ll never let you win.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, I will.",not spongebob,0
"What do you make of this, Barnacle Boy?",not spongebob,0
"Tangled timeline, Mermaid Man. I-",not spongebob,0
You old coots provided me the perfect distraction. Now prepare to be disappeared!,not spongebob,0
"Sounds good on paper, you purveyor of pure evil, but, fortunately, we all know what happens to paper underwater. Barnacle Boy, the tartar sauce.",not spongebob,0
Wow! I've never eaten that much tartar sauce.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, you have.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it sure ain't sittin' right.",not spongebob,0
"Foolish mools. Once again, your bufoonery has given me victory!  Oh, I'm going to savor this. It's not every day I get to defeat Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy three times over!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don’t eat the tartar sauce!",not spongebob,0
"You’re too late! Your fat friend beat you to it. Now, prepare to taste laser!  So how...",not spongebob,0
I told you we had to go back farther!,not spongebob,0
Uh...,not spongebob,0
"Up, up, and away!",not spongebob,0

I can't get my head around this. Where are they all coming from?  Another machine?,not spongebob,0
I took care of your blasted time machine!,not spongebob,0
Uh! I got to sit down and think this through.,not spongebob,0
Gotta! You've got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, did you say something? I'm still trying to comprehend what just happened here.",not spongebob,0
"It's pretty simple, really. You were defeated by a convoy of continuum-cruising crime stoppers. Thank you, SpongeBob and Patrick.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi there! Hello! Hello! Hello!",not spongebob,0
We just wanted to come back and revisit the day that evil was defeated forever.,not spongebob,0

You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
I heard they have better weather over there.,not spongebob,0
"No! Wait!  This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  At ease!  How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?",not spongebob,0
"I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!",spongebob,1
"I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!",not spongebob,0
"Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!",spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
"One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.",spongebob,1
How?,not spongebob,0
I took him to see a hypnotist.,spongebob,1
You took Patrick to a hypnotist?,not spongebob,0
No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.,spongebob,1
I thought you said it was a barnacle.,not spongebob,0
What did I say?,spongebob,1
Pelican.,not spongebob,0
He was a really good hypnotist.,spongebob,1
Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.,spongebob,1
Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?,not spongebob,0
Hypnosis? No! Hold still now.,spongebob,1
Is everything okay?,not spongebob,0
I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work!,spongebob,1
Did it come off?,not spongebob,0
Gettin' there.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how much longer?",not spongebob,0
"Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.",spongebob,1
Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.,not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?",spongebob,1
There's more!,not spongebob,0
"I mean, you're right. There's more.",spongebob,1
All I did was wash with soap and water!,not spongebob,0
Hmm... Water and... this soap?,spongebob,1
"Yes, but why?",not spongebob,0
"Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
More for me!,spongebob,1
"No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing.",spongebob,1
"Pearl, I'm home!",not spongebob,0
"Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewels!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.",spongebob,1
I'm not going to the dance!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.",spongebob,1
And what exactly would that do to me?,not spongebob,0
"I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!",spongebob,1
How?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again.",spongebob,1
Okay. Where do you keep your soap?,spongebob,1
"In the basement. Duh, where else?",not spongebob,0
Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?",spongebob,1
"Why, it's my old soap press!",not spongebob,0
Soap press?,spongebob,1
"That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
Leftover Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
"Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...",spongebob,1
I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?,not spongebob,0
Krabby Patty essence.,not spongebob,0
That's grease!,not spongebob,0

"The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!",spongebob,1
Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...",spongebob,1
Are you done yet?,not spongebob,0
"All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  And, ta-da. What do you think?",spongebob,1
"I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?",not spongebob,0
We shall see shortly.,spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
Shh. Trust me.,spongebob,1

I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.,not spongebob,0

"No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.",spongebob,1
I want an award!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day.",spongebob,1
I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.,not spongebob,0
But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.,spongebob,1
That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.",spongebob,1
Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!,not spongebob,0

The smallest you can think of.,spongebob,1
A job at the Krusty Krab?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.,spongebob,1
Then let's go.,not spongebob,0
"Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.",not spongebob,0
"And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?",spongebob,1

At least I'm safe inside my mind.,not spongebob,0
Stop copying me!,spongebob,1
There's no award for that!,not spongebob,0

"Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?",spongebob,1
Until I have as many awards as you.,not spongebob,0
We'll see about that!,spongebob,1
"No, we won't.",not spongebob,0
I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.,spongebob,1
"Me, too.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you don't!",not spongebob,0
"Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.,not spongebob,0
My turn!,not spongebob,0
"I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
What's so great about being a big pink loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.,not spongebob,0

"Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!",spongebob,1
Nobody does.  I lost her in the surf when we were kids.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock!,not spongebob,0

"Thanks, sis!",not spongebob,0
Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.,not spongebob,0
"Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.",not spongebob,0
"If big nose no like sand, big nose move!",not spongebob,0
"This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor.",not spongebob,0
No laughing!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you jokester.",spongebob,1
Do you think she looks a little... miffed?,not spongebob,0
Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!,not spongebob,0
Shame on you two! Look what you've done!,not spongebob,0
Look what we've done?!,not spongebob,0
"Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss.",not spongebob,0
"Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder.",not spongebob,0
"Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?",not spongebob,0
Blecorate?,not spongebob,0
"You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!",not spongebob,0
Make new house spiffy.  Spiffy!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!",not spongebob,0
Blecorate.,not spongebob,0
"That's the spirit, Sis.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!",not spongebob,0
"You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!",not spongebob,0
More spiffy!,not spongebob,0
But that's from...  My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!,not spongebob,0
"How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...",not spongebob,0
"Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?",spongebob,1
"No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!",not spongebob,0
"It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-",spongebob,1
Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water!  Meanies go home!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock.",not spongebob,0
Meanies is mean. .,not spongebob,0
"Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.",spongebob,1
The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!,not spongebob,0
I don't think you should do that.,spongebob,1
"Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get!",not spongebob,0
Who makes noise?  Spiffy broken!  Sister mad!,not spongebob,0
"Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.",spongebob,1
Sister Sam rearrange now!,not spongebob,0
Please don't.,spongebob,1
"Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started.",spongebob,1
Huh?!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?",spongebob,1
"Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!",not spongebob,0
That'll teach those meanies.,not spongebob,0
"Your still my rock big, sis.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?!",not spongebob,0
She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess she can get a little carried away.",not spongebob,0

"So, we meet again, Crazyfish!",spongebob,1
Bring it on!,not spongebob,0
With pleasure!,spongebob,1
So loud!,not spongebob,0
"You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!",spongebob,1
"You bet your frosting, Sponge-cake.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting.  Hey, that's cheating!",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You promise you won't laugh?  Okay, here goes.  Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste.  Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd...  Gare...?",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.  Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh!  SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did someone hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson.",spongebob,1
"Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"Hmm...  Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"He was big and mean. Oh, but old SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.",spongebob,1
What did you do?,not spongebob,0
I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.,spongebob,1
With tears?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.",spongebob,1
Then what happened?,not spongebob,0
"I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...",spongebob,1
I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed!,not spongebob,0
"That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy.",spongebob,1
There goes a real hero.,not spongebob,0
"Slugger, that's me.  What the?",spongebob,1
Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Whoa!  Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...",not spongebob,0
Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need them. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.,spongebob,1
"A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.",not spongebob,0
"Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.",spongebob,1
Why? Did he write it down?,not spongebob,0
"No, I engraved it on his pain gland.",spongebob,1
"Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!",spongebob,1
Jack M. Crazyfish?,not spongebob,0
"It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.",spongebob,1
So how'd you get the black eye then?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner.",spongebob,1
"Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty! I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part.",not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking.",spongebob,1
Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.,not spongebob,0
That's right.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm...",not spongebob,0
"Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.",spongebob,1
Not really.,not spongebob,0
"All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?",spongebob,1
"It was me, I said it.",not spongebob,0
"Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum.",spongebob,1
Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.,not spongebob,0
He's right.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  Don't worry, I'll save you. I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!",spongebob,1
"Uh, what did you say he looked like again?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...",spongebob,1
Little green hat?,not spongebob,0
"I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real...",spongebob,1
I'm looking for SpongeBob Squ--,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.",spongebob,1
I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walking, like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?",spongebob,1
"Uh, not really. I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.",spongebob,1
"Where I'm from, sorry don't cut it. We settle things in a different kind of way.",not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. BlackJack.  Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack! The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids!",spongebob,1
"Come on, little man! Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.",not spongebob,0
Why should we?,not spongebob,0
Because it'll show what a little man you are.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man.",not spongebob,0
"That brute has my parents! I got to get over there!  Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents!  Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? Do not cross? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed! NO! Get it together, SquarePants! To face BlackJack, you've got to be as tough as nails!  Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic! The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?  What's this? BlackJack smashed my family portrait! Oh, no! What has he done with my parents?!",spongebob,1
"Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you; what with you in the office all hours of the day.",not spongebob,0
I got a new outfit for ya!,not spongebob,0
"That fiend! Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note.  SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm going to do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack.  He's going to get Grandma, too! I have to stop him!  Grandma, where are you? Are you okay? Grandma? You in here? Grandma?  Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp! Oh, that animal!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?,spongebob,1
"Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.",not spongebob,0
But where's BlackJack?,spongebob,1
"Oh, BlackJack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.",not spongebob,0
Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?!,spongebob,1
"And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun.  And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.",not spongebob,0
"Cleaning up the mess?  I got to get help! I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's! He'll know what to do.  Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help!",spongebob,1
"Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby.",not spongebob,0
I need you to help me rescue my parents!,spongebob,1
"Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right.",not spongebob,0
346 minutes later...,not spongebob,0
"Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents! They're in danger!",spongebob,1
What? You want to build a fence?  The boy came to work.,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I came to try to find my...",spongebob,1
"And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you.  Ah.  And how many candles you burning out there? Over.  Do you copy? Over?  Copy? Do you copy?",not spongebob,0
"Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue! Please help me!",spongebob,1
"Well, of course you can!",not spongebob,0
"Much, much, much later...",not spongebob,0
I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!,spongebob,1
Landscaping? Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping?,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Uncle Captain Blue! We don't have much time. Cousin BlackJack has my parents held captive at his house!",spongebob,1
"They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.",not spongebob,0
That's why we have to rescue them now!,spongebob,1
"Whoa, there, Little Bobby. No can do.",not spongebob,0
"But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you!",spongebob,1
"No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?",not spongebob,0
You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?,spongebob,1
"Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to BlackJack's right now.  Just try to relax until we get there.  There it is. We're here.  Uh, lock the door behind you, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy.",spongebob,1
Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?,not spongebob,0
Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home.  Mother!  Mom?,spongebob,1
Help me!,not spongebob,0
"They're trapped in the basement!  Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here!",spongebob,1
"Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.",not spongebob,0
Party?,spongebob,1
"Oh, why, yes. We're celebrating your cousin BlackJack's release from prison.",not spongebob,0
Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...,not spongebob,0
"I told you, Harold, that was the fumigators' fault.",not spongebob,0
The fumigators? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?,spongebob,1
"The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill, but they should be gone by now.",not spongebob,0
"So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, your cousin BlackJack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.",not spongebob,0
"That's right, little man!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well here comes the man of the hour. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days.",not spongebob,0
"Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?",not spongebob,0
To quiver!,spongebob,1
I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time! THAT'S IT! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle?! Well, let's tussle it up!  Cousin BlackJack?",spongebob,1
In the living flesh!,not spongebob,0
That tickles!,spongebob,1
"Just like the old days, eh, cousin?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit.",spongebob,1
"97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?",not spongebob,0
Breathing.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.",not spongebob,0
"I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--",spongebob,1
I don't care what Mr. Krabs says! I just want--,not spongebob,0
Coffee rain!,spongebob,1
It's hot chocolate.,not spongebob,0
"Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait!",spongebob,1
It's locked!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Huh? The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid...",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Oh, why can't I just find?",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
What?!,not spongebob,0
"You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?,spongebob,1
"Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.",not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
So I could get further away from you!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?",not spongebob,0
"No, but you can help yourself to this ticket.",not spongebob,0
"Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school.",not spongebob,0
"Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?  Boating school.  Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Good morning class. Would everyone please take a seat?,not spongebob,0
"Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.",spongebob,1
"Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left.",not spongebob,0
But there's one right next to SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Do you mind?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.",spongebob,1
"We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?",not spongebob,0
Quiet in the front please.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.",spongebob,1
"Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.",not spongebob,0
"Um, I got caught speeding.",not spongebob,0
Very good. Next.,not spongebob,0
I don't see what's so very good about it.,not spongebob,0
"No, I didn't mean very.",not spongebob,0
I know exactly what you meant.,not spongebob,0
Next.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I am here because I.",spongebob,1
"We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir?",not spongebob,0
Me?,not spongebob,0
"Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?",not spongebob,0
"Why I'm.  All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!",not spongebob,0
"Yours too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.",not spongebob,0
"Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?",not spongebob,0
"Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.",not spongebob,0
His side?,not spongebob,0
"Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever.",not spongebob,0
Do you like it Squidward?,spongebob,1
Shut it.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy?",spongebob,1
"I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?",spongebob,1
"Mmm, Bon appétit, Squiddy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my...",not spongebob,0
"Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, didn't see that coming.",not spongebob,0
"Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, step on the gas?",spongebob,1
Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!",not spongebob,0
"I got it, I got it.",spongebob,1
Just let go of it!,not spongebob,0
Hooligans!,not spongebob,0
"Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.",not spongebob,0
How?,not spongebob,0
By using this shrink ray.,not spongebob,0
Mother of mercy!  Where'd they go?,not spongebob,0
There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip.,not spongebob,0
What's the matter?,not spongebob,0
Potato chips are his favorite snack.  Johnson! No!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no.",not spongebob,0
I never will understand these city folk.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, where'd Squidward go?",spongebob,1

"Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-",spongebob,1
"How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!",not spongebob,0
"Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.",spongebob,1
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
3 more minutes class.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.",not spongebob,0
2 more minutes.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, please? This is important.",not spongebob,0
"You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.",spongebob,1
"No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before.",not spongebob,0
Before what?,spongebob,1
Before before.,not spongebob,0
"1 more minute, class.",not spongebob,0
"Before we were,  boating buddies.",not spongebob,0
Yay!,spongebob,1
"Okay class, time’s up.",not spongebob,0
Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?,not spongebob,0
"You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.",not spongebob,0
Next week?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.  But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school!",spongebob,1
"This is it, Gary!",spongebob,1

"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm getting mine next.",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.",spongebob,1
Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you.,not spongebob,0
How are we going to do that?,spongebob,1
"Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head?",spongebob,1

"Splendid! Wonderful!  There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head?  Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna?  And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers?  Oh, yes, but that would be cheating.",not spongebob,0
HAHA! CHEATING!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!,not spongebob,0
I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!,spongebob,1
"Yes, my star pupil?",not spongebob,0
I think I'm cheating...,spongebob,1
"What's that, dear?",not spongebob,0
I think I am cheating!,spongebob,1
You've... you've let go of the wheel.,not spongebob,0
I do have an antenna under my hat!  There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!,spongebob,1
WHAT!?!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!",spongebob,1
Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff. This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.,not spongebob,0
"Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts.",not spongebob,0
Ripping good day for a spot of driving.,not spongebob,0
And a driver without boat smarts.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!",spongebob,1
"Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure.  Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level.  While this driver pays no need to boat smarts.  Buckling Up.  As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision.  Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign.  Now this driver, with no regard for safety.  Well, at least he had his seat belt on.  Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now?  You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, perfect.",spongebob,1
"Hey, use your mirrors, fool!",not spongebob,0
"Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet.",spongebob,1
Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road.  And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety.",not spongebob,0
Jerk!,not spongebob,0
Hi there!,spongebob,1
Help! Lunatic driver!,not spongebob,0
How's it going?,spongebob,1
I can't feel my hair. My leg!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law.",not spongebob,0
"Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!,spongebob,1
Never mind.,not spongebob,0
Closing time. The happiest time of the day!,not spongebob,0
"Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.",spongebob,1
What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!,not spongebob,0
Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.",spongebob,1
"And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun.",not spongebob,0
But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.,spongebob,1
You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?,not spongebob,0
The next day...,not spongebob,0
"Order up, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.",spongebob,1
"Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?,not spongebob,0
What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.,not spongebob,0
"Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?",not spongebob,0
Because it growled at me.,spongebob,1
"You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No... no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then...  SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.",not spongebob,0
"So I'm gonna be okay, doc?",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart.  Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no!  Oh no, this is terrible!",not spongebob,0
"Everything okay, doc?",not spongebob,0
Don't touch me!,not spongebob,0
That's not a good sign.,not spongebob,0
"Har, har har har har har har har har har!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!",not spongebob,0
"Eugene Krabs, your time has come.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room.  Excuse me, nurse?",not spongebob,0
Yes?,not spongebob,0
I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's in that room right there.",not spongebob,0
"No, that's Harold Flower's room.",not spongebob,0
Harold Flower?,not spongebob,0
"So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?",not spongebob,0
What do you want from me?,not spongebob,0
I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!,not spongebob,0
Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!  Here we are.",not spongebob,0
Blec! Why does it smell so foul?,not spongebob,0
Davy Jones works out a lot.  These are his socks. Get in!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.",not spongebob,0
Mommy!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.",not spongebob,0
You have me word as a sailor.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, boys!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?",spongebob,1
"Well, it was.",not spongebob,0
"You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?",not spongebob,0
A Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?",not spongebob,0
I don't go hungry?,not spongebob,0
"No, silly! It means free toy!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.",not spongebob,0
"I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.",spongebob,1
Great!,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, sir.",spongebob,1
Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?,not spongebob,0
"Eugene, my man.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! How's the break coming?,not spongebob,0
"Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?",not spongebob,0
This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!,not spongebob,0
No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.,not spongebob,0
"Here's your mail, Eugene.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.",not spongebob,0
"Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And...there's no money in here.  How delightful.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Me, too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.",not spongebob,0
Uh... dream?,not spongebob,0
Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!,not spongebob,0
"Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.",spongebob,1
Here's the bill.,not spongebob,0
"You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!",not spongebob,0
Your luck just ran out!,not spongebob,0
"Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.",not spongebob,0
"Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.",not spongebob,0
A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!,not spongebob,0
"I'm not cheap, I'm generous!",not spongebob,0
You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.",not spongebob,0
Wait just a burger-flipping second!,spongebob,1
Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?,not spongebob,0
"That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.",spongebob,1
He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.,not spongebob,0
I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.,spongebob,1
"You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?",not spongebob,0
"That depends, how much money we talking about?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
62 cents.,not spongebob,0
I'll take the money.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Squidward, money!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?",not spongebob,0
You think I could've gotten more?,not spongebob,0
He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!",not spongebob,0
"Here, take him back.",not spongebob,0
You heard what I said about the money?,not spongebob,0
"Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!",not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!",spongebob,1
He's your problem now.,not spongebob,0
"Heh, about trading you for pocket change...",not spongebob,0
"Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.",spongebob,1
You would have?,not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
Dutchman's residence.,not spongebob,0
"So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.",spongebob,1
"La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The Ild Ones! That's a strange name.  Scallop!  Bye Ild Ones. I like your silly name. Hmm...w. Oh, oh, they're not the Ild Ones. They must be the Wild Ones.",spongebob,1
"The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!",not spongebob,0
"No; I don't know who you are, either.",spongebob,1
"Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon!",not spongebob,0
Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?,not spongebob,0
"There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!",spongebob,1
"Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?",not spongebob,0
Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!,spongebob,1
What are you going on about? Bikers?,not spongebob,0
"The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea.",spongebob,1
"Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, this is serious!",spongebob,1
That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course.,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"A horrible biker gang called the Wild Ones are coming. We've got to run, hide!",spongebob,1
"Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around.,not spongebob,0
"Like this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
That's it.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.",spongebob,1
Huh.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I heard you. But what didn't hear was a hello.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.  Bloodthirsty bikers! Ah! We got to hide!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
"I... I don't want to talk about it, man.",not spongebob,0
Hide me!,not spongebob,0
"No, hide me!",spongebob,1
Hide me!,not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
"No, me!",not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
Me!,not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
No! No more running.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants.,not spongebob,0
Their leather socks.,spongebob,1
"If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.",not spongebob,0
"Say that again, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Little baby doody-heads?,not spongebob,0
"No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?",spongebob,1
I wouldn't mess with ya.,not spongebob,0
"Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, I feel protected now.",not spongebob,0
"Those are some mean looking rides, dudes.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.",spongebob,1
See?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's your salivation.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?",spongebob,1
Does that part include laughing at you? ‘Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.,not spongebob,0
Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?,spongebob,1
I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?",spongebob,1
"No, I don't.",not spongebob,0
What about our biker club?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
How about our biker organization?,spongebob,1
"No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.",not spongebob,0
What about our coalition?,spongebob,1
"Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.",not spongebob,0
"We'll just pencil you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.",spongebob,1
This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.,not spongebob,0
"Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.,not spongebob,0
Then can we save the town?,spongebob,1
Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me!  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind!  Oh. Thanks, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.",not spongebob,0
"Me? Annoying?  Yeah, right.",spongebob,1
"You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.",not spongebob,0
"What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...",spongebob,1
Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming!,not spongebob,0
"The Wild Ones?  Mable, get the kids!",not spongebob,0
"Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?",not spongebob,0
Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.,not spongebob,0
"What's that, missy?",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Howdy, we're the Mild Ones.",not spongebob,0
Mild Ones?  Oh!,spongebob,1
"Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.",not spongebob,0
Don't you want to spend any money?,not spongebob,0
Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride.,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?",spongebob,1
Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!,not spongebob,0
"Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make.",not spongebob,0
Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!,spongebob,1
"Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!",not spongebob,0
How disappointing.,not spongebob,0
"You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!",not spongebob,0
Hello? Daddy?,not spongebob,0
Thar she blows!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?",not spongebob,0
No new spatulas?,spongebob,1
"No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
"So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.",not spongebob,0
"Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!",spongebob,1
"All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, pole.",spongebob,1
"Hi, guys.",not spongebob,0
It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!,not spongebob,0
"Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.",not spongebob,0
I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!,not spongebob,0
What's in the box?,spongebob,1
It's a surprise.,not spongebob,0
I like surprises.,spongebob,1
"Great, then close your eyes.",not spongebob,0
I'm ready!,spongebob,1
"Well, I like it so far.",not spongebob,0
Ta-da...  It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!",spongebob,1
Fish paste.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!",spongebob,1
"Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.",not spongebob,0
"Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too.",not spongebob,0
Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!,not spongebob,0
"Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.",not spongebob,0
Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.,not spongebob,0
Squidward is such a barnacle.,not spongebob,0
A stick in the sand.,spongebob,1
"But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.",not spongebob,0
Me? Really?,spongebob,1
"Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here.",spongebob,1
"Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?",not spongebob,0
"For what, dare I ask?",not spongebob,0
"The new name for our new look. I mean, The Krusty Krab has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!",not spongebob,0
"Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?,spongebob,1
Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?,not spongebob,0
The King Krab?,spongebob,1
The Kandy Krab!,not spongebob,0
The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!,spongebob,1
Aaah! No!,not spongebob,0
"You're right, too scary.",spongebob,1
The Kuddly Krab!,not spongebob,0
It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
"That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?",not spongebob,0
That's it! I quit!,not spongebob,0
"Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision.",not spongebob,0
"Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, order up!",not spongebob,0
Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.,spongebob,1
"Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.",not spongebob,0
But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.,spongebob,1
Exactly.,not spongebob,0
"All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.",spongebob,1
This is so cool!,not spongebob,0
Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?,spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!",not spongebob,0
Uh... right on.,spongebob,1
Check out this new menu I came up with.,not spongebob,0
Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
"Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.  I've got something more fun for you to do anyway.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention!",not spongebob,0
"This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?",spongebob,1
"Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.",spongebob,1
Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.",spongebob,1
How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
"What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?",not spongebob,0
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.",spongebob,1
"That's it, boy!",not spongebob,0
What's it?,spongebob,1
You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.,not spongebob,0
"That's not what I said, sir.",spongebob,1
"Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office.",not spongebob,0
"Totally rude, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?",spongebob,1
"Sure, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes.",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!,not spongebob,0
"Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!",spongebob,1
"No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?",not spongebob,0
I got it! I can pretend to  fire you. I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.,spongebob,1
"Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!",not spongebob,0
Stop trying to break me in half?,spongebob,1
"Deal.  Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl, I need to have a word with you!",spongebob,1
"Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.",not spongebob,0
"It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...",spongebob,1
"Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...",spongebob,1
"I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, you're fired.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob.  Come on, gang, the mall awaits!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!",spongebob,1
"Oh, Pearly...  Is that a $20?  Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?",not spongebob,0
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
She's off to bigger and better things.,spongebob,1
"That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff?",not spongebob,0
"Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Ooh— Ooh— Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?,spongebob,1
We're so lucky.,not spongebob,0
Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar.  Whaa?  Huh?,spongebob,1
"Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, we need the combination!",not spongebob,0
I got it covered.,spongebob,1
Nyah!,not spongebob,0
Doink!  Mm. Mm-hmm.  Voilà!,spongebob,1
Ahh—ooh!,not spongebob,0
See? This is fun!,spongebob,1
Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso!  Ahh! Can't see my own feet.,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm. Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.,spongebob,1
Out of sight... Out of my mind.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, watch it!  Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks!  He'll pop out any second now.  Well?  Nothing. All right.  I really did it!  Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?",not spongebob,0
"It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it! Just don't blow it this time.",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Oh! Ahh!  Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula?  Ohh!  I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.",spongebob,1
"That's a trash can, you nitwit!  The formula?!  Face it, SpongeBob!  The formula—",not spongebob,0
Don't say it!,spongebob,1
Is gone.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I asked you not to say it!  Why would you ever do that?",spongebob,1
Come on.  Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up.  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please!  Oh, thank you.",not spongebob,0
Ah! It's alive!,spongebob,1
Hold on.  Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!  What are we gonna do?,spongebob,1
Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Come on! Open up!  Ahh!  Open Sesame?  It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.",not spongebob,0
"Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock.  It won't open until tomorrow morning.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I've waited this long.  What's a few more  excruciatingly long  hours?",not spongebob,0
"Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.",spongebob,1
Don't let the bed urchins bite.,not spongebob,0
"Eh, sure. You, too, you two.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's go get that formula.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, we are gonna pull  a Plankton on Plankton!",spongebob,1
Nyah! Whaa?,not spongebob,0
Sorry.  Stepped on my tail.,spongebob,1
What are you wearing?,not spongebob,0
"I'm a cat burglar!  Okay, I'll change.",spongebob,1
Hang on.  Ooh.,spongebob,1
And just how am I supposed to get in?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain!  I love a good romance.",not spongebob,0
Phew.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, honey.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Making sure he's asleep.,spongebob,1
Yeesh!  Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!",spongebob,1
Will you get him off of me?!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Ahh!  Get the stick, boy!  Fetch!",spongebob,1
Look out!,not spongebob,0
Diodes...zebras...Make a new batch of chum...,not spongebob,0
It's okay. She's in sleep mode.,spongebob,1
"Oh, dear, the chum is escaping.",not spongebob,0
This must be it.,not spongebob,0
Remain still for retina scan.,not spongebob,0
Now what'll we do?,not spongebob,0
Good thing I brought this!  They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.,spongebob,1
Looks like they captured the rest of him too!,not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
I'll take it from here.,not spongebob,0
I'm fine.,spongebob,1
You go first this time.,not spongebob,0
Hmm-mmph.,spongebob,1
You okay?,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!,spongebob,1
Heh...sorry.,spongebob,1
Ahh.  I can't believe that actually worked!,spongebob,1
"Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er... Why are you two smoldering?",not spongebob,0
"We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.",not spongebob,0
"No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed!",spongebob,1
You did what!?!?!? Plankton stole me formula?!,not spongebob,0
That's what he said. Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Then I'll just have to steal it back.  Hmm. Uh-huh.  Oh.  Don't worry. Papa's here.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!  Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no! Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you.  You're me new security system.",not spongebob,0
Yay!,spongebob,1
Wait! I'm claustrophobic!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Spatula down, sailor!",not spongebob,0
"What's going on, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"According to the nice man from the Labor Authority, it's time for your break, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
We get breaks?,spongebob,1
Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Well, of course you do, boy-o. Why, if I don't give you a five-minute break once every 20 years, this lovely man could fine me big bucks.",not spongebob,0
Nice meeting you.,spongebob,1
"And you don't want me to get fined, do you?",not spongebob,0
No! Never.,spongebob,1
Good! Then you just sit here and don't do or say nothing for five minutes  Oh—and enjoy your break.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! What are you doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, I just spotted a spot.",spongebob,1
"You can't work on your break, boy-o! Period! Remember the fines?",not spongebob,0
"I knew it! I've had my eye on you for years, Krabs! Oh, this violation is really gonna cost you!  Hmm...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can see we're gonna have to take drastic measures here.",not spongebob,0
Employee break room? I never knew this was here!,spongebob,1
"Oh, it's beautiful! Like stepping through a portal into the magical realm beyond!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, whatever. Five minutes!",not spongebob,0
I just hope there's enough time to enjoy everything.  Ooh!,spongebob,1
"Ooh.  Enjoy your carousel, my little hot dog friends.",spongebob,1
Surf's up!  Wipe out.,spongebob,1
I think this used to be...creamed corn!,spongebob,1
"Sorry, bub. Ha! I was meatloaf before I expired.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Globby, you're so silly.",spongebob,1
Voilà! My break room band. Scrubby and the Cleaning Crew. Hmm...  Let's see if I wired everything right.  Perfect.  Yeah!,spongebob,1
"Huh?  Ooh, music. I didn't know the Krusty Krab had a lounge.  Ooh!",not spongebob,0
Shake a leg!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on in, everyone. Try the funk, it's fresh.",spongebob,1
"I sure dig that! There we go, yes!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Where'd all me paying customers go?  What— Ow! What the—  A party?! I don't remember charging anyone for a party on me premises!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
"All right, that's it! Five minutes are up, SpongeBob! Break's over, everyone out! Everyone out! Out, out, out, out, out!",not spongebob,0
"You're in compliance this time, Krabs.  After-break at my house!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, that was so much fun! I can't wait for my next break in 20 years!",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, boy-o, 'cause it's time you got back to making me money.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Hmm, wonder where Squidward got to. Oh, well.",spongebob,1
"Hey, bub, have you seen my lid anywhere?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I'm on my break.",not spongebob,0
"Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick. We're all out.",spongebob,1
"Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip!?",not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
What are you two morons doing?,not spongebob,0
Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.,spongebob,1
At 3:47 in the morning?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
In my bedroom?,not spongebob,0
We come here every morning.,spongebob,1
You sneak into my house every morning?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
It's our favorite pastime.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?,not spongebob,0
Story time!,not spongebob,0
"Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave.",spongebob,1
"And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--",not spongebob,0
3 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
--for as long as time shall stand.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Get out!  Perfect.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party.",spongebob,1
"Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is so neat.",spongebob,1
"I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in.",not spongebob,0
Let's do it again.,not spongebob,0
Let's do it again.,spongebob,1
"Can we, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Huh? What? No! Get out!,not spongebob,0
But--,spongebob,1
"No! You're going out this door, right now--",not spongebob,0
"You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us.",spongebob,1
Do they have cute sea horses there?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they're pretty adorable.",spongebob,1
And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
Can I come?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh—yeah.  Good night, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Uh, new glasses?",not spongebob,0
"No, no. I mean he seems happier.",spongebob,1
"Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you!",not spongebob,0
He's probably happy about his new glasses.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, SpongeBob.  Honk!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, what are you doing here?",spongebob,1
"You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us.",spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?,spongebob,1
I wanted to help you work.,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Mr. Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!,not spongebob,0
How are we today? Everything a-okay here?,not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke.,not spongebob,0
"Mommy, I'm scared.",not spongebob,0
Who wants a free refill?,not spongebob,0
Did someone just say free?  What's the problem here?,not spongebob,0
"He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce,  and then he gave me a free hat!",not spongebob,0
Free?!  Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them.",spongebob,1
They look okay to me.,not spongebob,0
But he's not a real fry cook.,spongebob,1
"He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.",not spongebob,0
"Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
What's the meaning of this?,not spongebob,0
What's wrong with it?,spongebob,1
A smiley face with dimples?,not spongebob,0
Dimples? It was him! New Squidward did it.,spongebob,1
Mr. Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
"I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month.",not spongebob,0
"Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know.",not spongebob,0
The guy you're looking for is over there.,spongebob,1
Oh. SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--",not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm?,spongebob,1
Help me spell 'Squidward'.,not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house!",not spongebob,0
"Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake.",spongebob,1
I love being Employee of the Month.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy  but me!  Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there.",spongebob,1
He's too proud.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I want to dance funny, too!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, what's the big idea?  I don't need this aggravation! Why are you still standing here?!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!  What is happening in me restaurant?!,not spongebob,0
"The customers have gone crazy!  SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!",not spongebob,0
"But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing.  SpongeBob has passed away!",not spongebob,0
Or...maybe he's just seriously injured.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.",not spongebob,0
With pleasure!  What? Too soon?,not spongebob,0
Prepare yourselves for the horror.  Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Okay.",not spongebob,0
"But probably, like I said, the horror!",not spongebob,0
Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face!  Get away from him!,not spongebob,0
Such a nice kid.,not spongebob,0
"I—I—  Oh, good morning, everyone.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're alive!",not spongebob,0
"I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?",spongebob,1
"You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.",not spongebob,0
"You mean, the best.",not spongebob,0
"Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up.  See?  Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.",spongebob,1
"Oh, my clock!",spongebob,1
"Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together.  It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.",spongebob,1
"Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow.  Or else.",not spongebob,0
Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?,not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you.  Wow!",spongebob,1
"Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.",spongebob,1
"That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know,  I could totally fix your clock for you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and—  Well, okay, are you sure?",spongebob,1
"Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful.  Why don't you fix?!  Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.",spongebob,1
Hmm!  In that case...,not spongebob,0
"Um, hello?",spongebob,1
"Hello, there!  Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time  for a bargain. How can I help you?",not spongebob,0
Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?,spongebob,1
"Hmm…  Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second,  I have many others I can show you.",not spongebob,0
"Wow. So many to choose from.  Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. I'll just take 'em all!",spongebob,1
"Ah! I'm rich!  Whoo!  Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works.  Goodnight, Gare-bear.",spongebob,1
One hour later...,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
Late.,not spongebob,0
I hope this one works.,spongebob,1
Late again...,not spongebob,0
Late!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
You get the idea!,not spongebob,0
"Late!  Late!  Late!  Still late!  Late!  Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!",not spongebob,0
Still late.,not spongebob,0
"Late again.  I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow.  Or else.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know how many more or elses I can take.  I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what a great idea!",spongebob,1
"0 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I really thought that last or else would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.",not spongebob,0
"Right on time!  Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.",not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
Good morning...,spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today.  D'oh!",not spongebob,0
"Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Just five more minutes, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Sir, there's a line.",not spongebob,0
I'm filing a complaint.  I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.",not spongebob,0
What in Poseidon's beard?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, looks like it's—",not spongebob,0
Time for or else?,spongebob,1
You better be at work on time or else  I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, what?  No!",spongebob,1
I did it!,not spongebob,0
"Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!",spongebob,1
"Uh, kind of.",not spongebob,0
"Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.",not spongebob,0
"Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga-dinga!",not spongebob,0
Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey, Squidward! Want to play?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Are you sure?,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy!  Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!",spongebob,1
Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!",spongebob,1
How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?,not spongebob,0
"I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!",spongebob,1
"This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm not hungry.",spongebob,1
"Well, thanks for stopping by.",not spongebob,0
Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!,spongebob,1
Why would I do that?,not spongebob,0
He's hungry.,spongebob,1
"He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!",not spongebob,0
"What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.",not spongebob,0
I'm not taking an order for a bubble.,not spongebob,0
Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit.,not spongebob,0
May I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything.",spongebob,1
"One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table.",not spongebob,0
Bubble Buddy's thirsty.,spongebob,1
How about a glass of our finest shampoo?,not spongebob,0
Sounds great!,spongebob,1
"Here's your hair care product, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?",spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
Think of the customer.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!",spongebob,1
And?,not spongebob,0
"Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?",spongebob,1
We? How about you take these patties and sh...,not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.",spongebob,1
"What, is he allergic to bread, too?",not spongebob,0
"Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...",spongebob,1
"Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.",not spongebob,0
"That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab.",not spongebob,0
What's this?,not spongebob,0
Bubble money.  At least they left a tip!,not spongebob,0
"Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here.",spongebob,1
"Dudes, bury me!",not spongebob,0
See what I mean?  All done!,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy.",spongebob,1
"Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in.  Dude?",not spongebob,0
My friend's in there.,spongebob,1
Congratulations.,not spongebob,0
Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!,spongebob,1
"It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!",not spongebob,0
"Later, groupies!  Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again.",not spongebob,0

Popcorn! Peanuts!,not spongebob,0
Ice cold drinks!,not spongebob,0

"Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished!",spongebob,1
He kept us waiting for a bubble?,not spongebob,0
That's nothing! He called us fat!,not spongebob,0
He washed my flipper!,not spongebob,0
He owes me money!,not spongebob,0
He made me provide excellent service!,not spongebob,0
Dudes! He made me experience high tide!,not spongebob,0

No... But are we just gonna wait around until he does?,not spongebob,0
I say we tip something over!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey!",not spongebob,0

Get the lifeguard!,not spongebob,0
Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?,not spongebob,0
Pop the bubble!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?",spongebob,1
Yes...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?",spongebob,1
No...,not spongebob,0
Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.",spongebob,1
No. Go as in...,not spongebob,0
Why?!,spongebob,1
You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!,not spongebob,0
No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never...,spongebob,1
"Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!",not spongebob,0

So long.,spongebob,1
Happy Leif Erikson Day!,not spongebob,0

Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.,spongebob,1
Uh...hi?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you stupid bubble, I just washed those!",not spongebob,0
My spine!,not spongebob,0
Why don't you watch where you're going?!,not spongebob,0
Get back here!,not spongebob,0
I'll sue!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see now. Dear SpongeBob...",spongebob,1
"The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!",spongebob,1
"♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.",spongebob,1
"No, I don't!",not spongebob,0
You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.,spongebob,1
"So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!",spongebob,1
Would you please get your friend out of my house?,not spongebob,0
Where is he?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  Oh no! You don't think he p-p-p-p-popped in there ...?!",spongebob,1
There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!,not spongebob,0
Phew...,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha!",spongebob,1
Of course.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!",spongebob,1
"Shiny, no!",spongebob,1
"Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window!",spongebob,1
"I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye!",spongebob,1
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Morning, laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?",not spongebob,0
"This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.",spongebob,1
"Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble.",spongebob,1
Put it there!  Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Come here you little rascal!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.",spongebob,1
"Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?",not spongebob,0
"Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.",spongebob,1
"Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.",spongebob,1
Woooowww! Hernia.,not spongebob,0
What in the name of Neptune is going on-,not spongebob,0
Money! Yay!,not spongebob,0
"There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt.",spongebob,1
You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.,not spongebob,0
"That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the let's do nothing at all game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-",spongebob,1
Shiny? Shiny where are you?,spongebob,1
"Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get you to my house and keep you away from sharp pointy things.",spongebob,1
"Oh, tartar sauce. Oooh!",spongebob,1
"Bikini Bottom Pin Factory?! Shiny, no! I'll save you!  You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose.",spongebob,1
"Where's Shiny? Oh, no!  Scissor Works? I'll save you, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed!",spongebob,1
"Shiny?  Pitchfork Pantry. Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace safe for you to visit. Ah, that's it. The Pillow Foundry. You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.",spongebob,1
"Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know!",spongebob,1
"Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, now!  Phew, he's okay.",spongebob,1
Uh-oh.,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's...  ...doing great.",spongebob,1
"I see you've grown a second head, again, son.",not spongebob,0
Again?,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it.  So, did my son behave himself?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil, sort of way.",spongebob,1
"Well, see you later.",not spongebob,0
"Bye-bye. Anytime you need a babysitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.",spongebob,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the most fascinating place on Earth, Bubbletown! A bouncing, vibrant city, where everyone... and everything is comprised entirely of globules of air!",not spongebob,0
Ooh!  A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!,spongebob,1
Let's take a closer look at this effervescent city! Some bubbletowners drive to work in their bubble cars. While others simply float. Having a bubble car is great because parking is a cinch!  Bubbletown also provides excellent public transportation. Seats are always available because these high-tech buses can account for any number of passengers.  Here are some workers going to work in their bubble building.,not spongebob,0
"You may wanna use the door.  This office uses stand-up desks, and the ceiling for a more efficient work environment.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa-whoa.  Wow!",spongebob,1
"Yes, there's all kinds of things to see and do in Bubbletown! You can enjoy Bubbletown's very own band!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
"And if you're hungry, why not try a bubble dog from one of our many bubble food vendors?",not spongebob,0
"One, please?",spongebob,1
Here you are.,not spongebob,0
"Mmm!  Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs!  Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Gee, it's good to see ya!",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, oops. Sorry.",spongebob,1
"Oh, don't worry about it.",not spongebob,0
"So, how you been? How are things?",spongebob,1
"Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter.",not spongebob,0
Let me see if I can fix that for you.,spongebob,1
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.",not spongebob,0
"Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!",not spongebob,0
"You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof.",not spongebob,0
Honey!,not spongebob,0
I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...,spongebob,1
And...clear!,not spongebob,0
Count me in!,spongebob,1
Fantastic!,not spongebob,0
"Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!",not spongebob,0
I need some pajamas.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, mm, uh-huh.",spongebob,1
I want another sandwich!,not spongebob,0
Monster truck tires!,not spongebob,0
"Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!",spongebob,1
"Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown!",spongebob,1
Watch out for those—,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—",spongebob,1
"Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Whoa!  My eyes!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, come back!",not spongebob,0
"Amy, will you marry me?",not spongebob,0
Yes! I will!,not spongebob,0
Aw.,not spongebob,0
I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.,not spongebob,0
I wuv to learn!,not spongebob,0
Hey! That was my job!,not spongebob,0
I'm so sorry! I can't stop!,spongebob,1
Watch out!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.",not spongebob,0
No! Stay away!  I'm a monster!  A monster!  Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!,spongebob,1
My bubble legs!,not spongebob,0
My monster truck tires!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, that doesn't look great.  But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.",not spongebob,0
I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.",spongebob,1
"All right, you get one phone call.",not spongebob,0
"Okay.  The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second.  Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um... I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry!",spongebob,1
Later…,not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Du, huh, what, who?",not spongebob,0
What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?,not spongebob,0
I'm okay!,not spongebob,0
Well…?,not spongebob,0
What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.,not spongebob,0
What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—",spongebob,1
"Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can!",not spongebob,0
Wha—whoa.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.",spongebob,1
"Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!",not spongebob,0
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!,not spongebob,0
"Eat claw, bubble cop!",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh?,not spongebob,0
Honey!,not spongebob,0
"Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here.  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
You popped it all.  There's nothing left!,spongebob,1
"Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.",not spongebob,0
"No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved.",spongebob,1
"So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Let's blow this popsicle stand.,spongebob,1
"I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
"Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o!  I am making money claw over fist here.  Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?",not spongebob,0
There is none!,not spongebob,0
Exchange rate?,not spongebob,0
That's it. We're done here.,not spongebob,0
Huh.,spongebob,1
I wuv to learn!,not spongebob,0
After you.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, thank you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
My turn.,not spongebob,0
Neato.  Watch this.,spongebob,1
Wow.  Monosodium glutamate!,not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles.",not spongebob,0
Hmm...,spongebob,1
I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.,not spongebob,0
Nah.,not spongebob,0
"20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
Squidward.,not spongebob,0
What? What? Who said that?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request?",not spongebob,0
Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?,not spongebob,0
Avenge me.,not spongebob,0
Avenge me?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
I must have more.,not spongebob,0
You want more?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you moron, you ruined my bon…  ...sai.",not spongebob,0
Let's go to Sandy's.,spongebob,1
"Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy",not spongebob,0
Maybe even smarter.,spongebob,1
"Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.",not spongebob,0
Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb.,not spongebob,0
"I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you.",spongebob,1
"That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines.",not spongebob,0
Oops.,spongebob,1
"I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.",not spongebob,0
Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door.,spongebob,1
Even I knew that was dumb.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?,spongebob,1
I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.",not spongebob,0
She's totally losing it.,not spongebob,0
Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.,not spongebob,0
Never mind. She seems fine.,not spongebob,0
"Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight.",spongebob,1
"Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut.",not spongebob,0
"Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.,not spongebob,0
Ahh...  You taste like glass.,not spongebob,0
Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.,spongebob,1
Get what over with?,not spongebob,0
Where's Sandy,spongebob,1
I thought she was with you.,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,spongebob,1
"Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.",not spongebob,0
"No Sandy, you need air, not food!",spongebob,1
Hey! What's going on out here?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.",spongebob,1
"Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. I believe. Good old atomic number eight.",not spongebob,0
"Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.",not spongebob,0
But how are you gonna get them down?,not spongebob,0
Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.,spongebob,1
Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back.",spongebob,1
"Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'm ready.",spongebob,1
"Just a little bit further. Okay, got it.",not spongebob,0
"Hurry up, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hm-mmm.,not spongebob,0
Looks like her color's coming back.,not spongebob,0
"That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air.",spongebob,1
I said what?,not spongebob,0
"So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy.",not spongebob,0
"Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later.",not spongebob,0
"No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I guess so.",not spongebob,0
"And you breathe air, right?",spongebob,1
"Sure, my nose is full of it.",not spongebob,0
You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.,spongebob,1
I guess us mammals have to stick together.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.",spongebob,1
But how are you going to get up there?,not spongebob,0
I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.,spongebob,1
"An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"I know. Wish me luck, old friend.",spongebob,1
"SquarePants, I salute you.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down.",spongebob,1
"Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghost!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, here we go.",spongebob,1
"Ah, ah! Oof!",not spongebob,0
"Welcome back, Sandy.",spongebob,1
I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble.",spongebob,1
"Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. At least it's structurally sound.  Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.",not spongebob,0
"Then why don't you fix this rust bucket up? Look around. Chipping paint, bad plumbing, dust bunnies--  it's no wonder you don't have any customers.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul.  Whoa! Whoa!  I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor.  Ah! This is a job for an imbecile!  Or two imbeciles.  Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.",not spongebob,0
"Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Uh-huh. I came prepared, too.  Alright, let’s do it.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.",not spongebob,0
"Pizzazz, yeah!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, really?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen now, would you?",not spongebob,0
"No, sir. Uh-uh.",not spongebob,0
"Well, hop to it, lads.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.",not spongebob,0
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.,not spongebob,0
"What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?",not spongebob,0
"Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz!",spongebob,1
"Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?",not spongebob,0
Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.,not spongebob,0
Let's show him,spongebob,1
"You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons.,not spongebob,0
"Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?,spongebob,1
"Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut.",not spongebob,0
I see what you mean.,spongebob,1
Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?,not spongebob,0
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.,spongebob,1
"Secret formula, here I come.",not spongebob,0
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.,spongebob,1
"Perfect. Huh?  No! No! NO! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes. Voila!",not spongebob,0
A log cabin?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art.",not spongebob,0
Everyone's a critic.,not spongebob,0
I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?",not spongebob,0
I guess I hadn't thought about that.,spongebob,1
"I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.",not spongebob,0
"See, SpongeBob? Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird.",not spongebob,0
"CAN'T YOU TWO DO ANYTHING RIGHT? I give you one simple task after another and...  Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing, life guarding, creative writing—all such bitter failures.",not spongebob,0
"Oh. It's okay, little green... creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest  restaurant in Bikini Bottom!",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating!",spongebob,1
"Oh, goodbye, paintbrush.  Hello, antique fitting!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.",not spongebob,0
Hup-hup-hup-hup!  Hup-hup-hup-hup!,not spongebob,0
"I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No. No tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula is — one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe travel size. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!! Yaaagh!!!  Huh!? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHUM BUCKET?!?!?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.",not spongebob,0
I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation.,spongebob,1
And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!/Yay!,not spongebob,0
"And I bet you tried to steal this, too.",not spongebob,0
"Hehehhehheh... well, steal is such a strong word.",not spongebob,0
You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. Do ya?,not spongebob,0
Now stay away from me...,not spongebob,0
"...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors. Heh-yah!  Ahhhhhhhhhhh.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.",not spongebob,0
"Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day.",not spongebob,0
"Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?",not spongebob,0
"That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.",not spongebob,0
And these metal decorations?,not spongebob,0
Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.,not spongebob,0
And the computer?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's Plankton's wife.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.",not spongebob,0
But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's true—it is pretty classy in here. Gimme four!",not spongebob,0
"And how was your meal today, ma'am?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.",not spongebob,0
I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's the way you want it.",not spongebob,0
Wait! I have an idea!,spongebob,1
Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.",spongebob,1
"My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough! Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community.",not spongebob,0
Community!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I really hope people like it!",not spongebob,0
Great!,not spongebob,0
Super good!,not spongebob,0
Number 1 with a star!,not spongebob,0
"See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.",spongebob,1
Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!,not spongebob,0
Let's see what other nice people are saying.,spongebob,1
What are you shrieking about?,not spongebob,0
Nothing! I just love to shriek!,spongebob,1
"Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!",not spongebob,0
"When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside! P-Star7. Ouch!",not spongebob,0
Not on my bulletin board!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.",spongebob,1
"Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.",spongebob,1
"Huh? Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted. Signed, Guybesideu3?",spongebob,1
"Huh?  Dumb-blurted! LOL!?, What's the Point?, I could make a better patty out of mud?! Where are all these notes coming from?",spongebob,1
"Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!",not spongebob,0
I want to express the worst side of myself!,not spongebob,0
"Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!",not spongebob,0
Huh?  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.,spongebob,1
Hello!,not spongebob,0
P-Star7 is my new hero.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's me!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, right.",not spongebob,0
He really knows how to complain.,not spongebob,0
But I wasn't com...,not spongebob,0
P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.",not spongebob,0
"You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it real. He's a true hero for our troubled times.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.",spongebob,1
"No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.",spongebob,1
"No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.",spongebob,1
Now it's smaller than that one!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?,spongebob,1
"Oh, he responded hours ago.",not spongebob,0
"Well, why didn't you tell me?",spongebob,1
Because I don't care.,not spongebob,0
"That's for me! Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139! Cordially, P-Star7.",spongebob,1
His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why did you have to say that?",spongebob,1
"You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead.  Signed, HandsomeLad42.",not spongebob,0
"You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!",spongebob,1
"Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.",not spongebob,0
I brought a bag lunch.,not spongebob,0
What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!,not spongebob,0
Why would we buy food from a place that quote  Smells like stinky armpits?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's not true!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's on the board.",not spongebob,0
And the board is never wrong.,not spongebob,0
And does anyone need to buy a pen?,not spongebob,0
How about some paper?,not spongebob,0
What's wrong?,not spongebob,0
It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I think they were all good things.",not spongebob,0
Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.,spongebob,1
"Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.",not spongebob,0
No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.,spongebob,1
You were Fry-Banshee?!,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...",not spongebob,0
He said that?!,spongebob,1
"Oh, not yet!",not spongebob,0
"Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!",not spongebob,0
He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.",spongebob,1
"Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!",not spongebob,0
You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!,spongebob,1
You smell!,not spongebob,0
One of your eyes is too big!,not spongebob,0
Close your mouth when you eat!?,not spongebob,0
"Oh!  This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp! Oh, Daddy!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register. P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yokels understand I'm working here? Ironically!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.",not spongebob,0
"I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!",not spongebob,0
"People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!",spongebob,1
"Okay, that's it! Everybody out!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.",spongebob,1
We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!,not spongebob,0
A lesson in polite manners.,spongebob,1
Or we could push him off a cliff.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!",spongebob,1
"Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.",spongebob,1
"This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?",not spongebob,0
"Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.",spongebob,1
I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!,not spongebob,0
Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.,not spongebob,0
So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.,spongebob,1
"Surprise, P-Star7!",spongebob,1
Patrick?!,not spongebob,0
I'll tear ya to pieces!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're P-Star7?",spongebob,1
"Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.",not spongebob,0
"So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I think.",not spongebob,0
"You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, ratfish!",not spongebob,0
Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn?,spongebob,1
"Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.,not spongebob,0
"Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?",spongebob,1
"Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine.",not spongebob,0
Time off?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this... SpongeBob, take a vacation.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, that went better than expected.",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.",spongebob,1
I thought you were on vacation.,not spongebob,0
"He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.",not spongebob,0
What's a vacation?,spongebob,1
"Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.",not spongebob,0
No work?! But what'll I do all day?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.",not spongebob,0
But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.,spongebob,1
Nor will I.,not spongebob,0
That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.",not spongebob,0
"Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.",not spongebob,0
Replacement?,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
That's enough banter on my dime.,not spongebob,0
"Ok, boss.",not spongebob,0
"Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job.",not spongebob,0
"Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.",not spongebob,0
I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!",spongebob,1
"Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not here to see you, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?",not spongebob,0
I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.,spongebob,1
"Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.",not spongebob,0
"You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, it's not what you think.",spongebob,1
"Out you go, boy.",not spongebob,0
But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.",spongebob,1
"I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.",spongebob,1
"Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.",not spongebob,0
"I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.",spongebob,1
"Huh? What's the big idea, here?",not spongebob,0
"Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, shhh.",spongebob,1
It talks!,not spongebob,0
"Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.",spongebob,1
"Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Not a problem at all, me boy.",not spongebob,0
"Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.",spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"My house is back that way, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
"Far out, little man. Far out.",not spongebob,0
Where'd you say you were taking me?,spongebob,1
"Look, boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!",not spongebob,0
"It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!",spongebob,1
"Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? Is that you?,not spongebob,0
"I've been waiting for you, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!",not spongebob,0
What’ll be?,not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
One shell on a shingle.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.",spongebob,1
"Why'd you do it, laddy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!",spongebob,1
"You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.",not spongebob,0
You must've saved a fortune.,spongebob,1
"Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.",not spongebob,0
Wow! That's more than I make in a year.,spongebob,1
Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.,not spongebob,0
Yippee! I happily acquiesce.,spongebob,1
"Once around the roundabout.  Left at the wall.  Over the Bump of Truth.  And finally, the flaming hoop!  Thank you, Mrs. Puff, I am now a car daring figure and a producing member of society.  Woo-hoo! Yeah!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test.  Mrs. Puff, you okay?",spongebob,1
Just start driving.  Turn this boat around immediately!,not spongebob,0
"Right away, ma’am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control...",spongebob,1
"Next up, Goin' Bananas 3: In 3D.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, dude, pass the 3D glasses. This is supposed to be, like, in 3D.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, right!",not spongebob,0
Here I am! I'm coming at ya like your worst nightmare!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"I think it's safe to say you have once again, failed your driving test!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-",spongebob,1
"No buts, SpongeBob! You fail this test over and over! I'm beginning to think you are simply... unteachable!  Now, get out of my sight!",not spongebob,0
"I...I...  I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!",spongebob,1
"Dude, this is, like, the gnarliest 3-D movie ever!",not spongebob,0
"If only SpongeBob could pass his boating test, he'd be out of my life once and for all. Unfortunately, I keep getting reminded of the consequences if I get too angry with the little nuisance.  I can't even leave town without violating my parole.  If there was only some way that I didn't have to live in fear.  Fear! That's the answer! SpongeBob is afraid of the driving course! So it would stand to reason that if he took the driving test somewhere else besides the driving course, he would pass!  Of course! The answer's been in front of me all along! I'll test SpongeBob on a real road and then he'll be out of my life forever!  Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?",not spongebob,0
"Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth?  Come back later; I'm wallowing.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that! Let's forget what I said. It's time to take a fresh approach.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un-",spongebob,1
"We don't have time for this, SpongeBob. We have a long day of driving ahead of us.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?",spongebob,1
"To overcome your fears, silly.",not spongebob,0
It's not working!,spongebob,1
Here we are!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, where are we?",spongebob,1
This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.,not spongebob,0
Dr-iving test?!,spongebob,1
"That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course.  Out here, there's nothing but the road.  Now, scooch over.  Come on. Scooch over.",not spongebob,0
"But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?",spongebob,1
"Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!",spongebob,1
"Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Got it?",not spongebob,0
"O-o-okay.  Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff.",spongebob,1
Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.,not spongebob,0
"Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road.",spongebob,1
Boating within the lines.  Well done.,not spongebob,0
Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1

Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1
"Roundabout navigation, check!",not spongebob,0
"Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!",spongebob,1
"Safe and steady acceleration, check!",not spongebob,0
Focus on the road...  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1
"First, he drives on what looks like a mobius strip. Then he drives over a road with another SpongeBob under it. Then, he drives up a curvy road with a SpongeBob like face, which swallows the boat. The camera pans upward to a Saturn-like planet, and SpongeBob jumps out of the planet and drives along its ringlike road. The rings break and SpongeBob flies into the screen, acting like he's in a trance. The same goes with the boat driving into the screen, SpongeBob's head is at the bow. The boat drives around the inside of another SpongeBob, while at a real-life road. Finally, a skull rises, SpongeBob's mouth is in its eye sockets. Its road-tongue rolls out, and SpongeBob skates out, wearing boats as rollerskates. He jumps off, spins, and falls. Cut back to Mrs. Puff in reality]",not spongebob,0
Check...check...and...CHECK!  What is this?!,not spongebob,0
Safely dock vessel],not spongebob,0
"Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel.",not spongebob,0

"Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!",not spongebob,0
"Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!",spongebob,1
Just stop the boat!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh...  The road!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, wait!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBoooob!,not spongebob,0
That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? This isn't just any road.  It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway!,not spongebob,0
Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!,spongebob,1

Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers.,not spongebob,0

"Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look!  No!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, hit the brakes!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh! Okay!,spongebob,1
"Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license!  And I'm free! Ha ha!",not spongebob,0
I don't think so.,not spongebob,0
"Is there a problem, officer?",not spongebob,0
"Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am,  are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that.",not spongebob,0

"I am a culinary genius, no?  Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward.  Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish.  Stay warm, my little Squidy.  Le oww!  Typical, I always forget something.",not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
A sea bunny?,not spongebob,0

My roast à la Squidward!,not spongebob,0
What the—,not spongebob,0
Oof!,not spongebob,0
I declare war on bunnies!,not spongebob,0
I am going to bury that bunny!,not spongebob,0
"Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!",not spongebob,0
Did you have to catch him that easily?,not spongebob,0

A sock?,not spongebob,0
"Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!",spongebob,1

Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent.  Ding!  And talent equals money!",not spongebob,0
I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!,spongebob,1
"Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.",not spongebob,0
Why'd you do that?,spongebob,1
"In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.",spongebob,1
Nonsense. You're a born performer.  Ooh!  Here.  You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm? Uh...  Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!",not spongebob,0
I can't! I've got stage fright!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!",not spongebob,0
There he is!  ChefBob!  Me little star!  Break a leg. Break two legs.,not spongebob,0
My leg!,not spongebob,0
"Shut up, Fred!  Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!",not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's just wrong!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?  Huh? Oh!",spongebob,1
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
I guess I am.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob!  Your order, please!",not spongebob,0
The little ChefBob is a sensation.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
We are!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!",not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,not spongebob,0
Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.",not spongebob,0
"Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping!",not spongebob,0
D-did I say that? I didn't say that.,spongebob,1
"Hey, do me! Insult me!",not spongebob,0
"Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
That was a good one.,not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh!,not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.",spongebob,1
Me next!  Shoot me a zinger!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that.  I don't speak goober!",not spongebob,0
I love it! Guilty as charged!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.",not spongebob,0
"Ho, ho, ho, ho!  Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, what's this, here?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.",spongebob,1
"Oh-ho, does he?  Fresh cut seaweed.  A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand? What?  A bigger dressing room?",not spongebob,0
"In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.",not spongebob,0
Blubber Boy?!  No way!,not spongebob,0
"What's the matter, Krabs?  You don't like money?",not spongebob,0
What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes.,not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?",spongebob,1
Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.",spongebob,1
"ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.",not spongebob,0
"Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.",not spongebob,0
"Let me make it up to ya!  Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.",not spongebob,0
"I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!",spongebob,1
That's even more insulting.,not spongebob,0
"Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Not funny!,not spongebob,0
He scores!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!",not spongebob,0
Have a drink!,not spongebob,0
"No, no!",not spongebob,0
En garde!,spongebob,1
"Me customers!  Alright, enough of this.",not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, you are hereby fired!  Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?",not spongebob,0
Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!,not spongebob,0
I learned a very valuable lesson today.,spongebob,1
To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?,not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, that, but  mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer.",spongebob,1
Ow.,spongebob,1
"What is it, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"What is it, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
It's—it's alive!,not spongebob,0
"And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
"Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
"Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!",not spongebob,0
It's here!,not spongebob,0
"Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops.",spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!",spongebob,1
Let me try!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry.",not spongebob,0
"You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out.",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Onward... to Squidward's house.,spongebob,1
Go away!,not spongebob,0
"To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?",spongebob,1
They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.,not spongebob,0
Who?,spongebob,1
"My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?",spongebob,1
It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut.",spongebob,1
What's it saying?,not spongebob,0
"It says... It's dark in here. Got anything else, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a nice, hot frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!",not spongebob,0
"So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine.",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure.",not spongebob,0
"We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!",spongebob,1
What'll we do?,not spongebob,0
"They're looking for an invention, right?",spongebob,1
Right.,not spongebob,0
So let's start inventing!,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"It's time to get serious, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.,not spongebob,0
"That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.",not spongebob,0
"Light bulb, already invented.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.",not spongebob,0
"That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.",spongebob,1
Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea.",not spongebob,0
Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.,spongebob,1
"♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪",not spongebob,0
"I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.",spongebob,1
Who?,not spongebob,0
Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!,spongebob,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,not spongebob,0
"Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade.",not spongebob,0
At your service.,not spongebob,0
And this is Lord Reginald.,not spongebob,0
Charmed.,not spongebob,0
You guys talk funny. Say more words!,not spongebob,0
"We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.",not spongebob,0
"Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!",spongebob,1
And I used to be dumb.,not spongebob,0
Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?,not spongebob,0
My name is SpongeBob.,spongebob,1
And I am Professor Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Professor?,spongebob,1
Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.,not spongebob,0
Where is Miss Cheeks?,not spongebob,0
She should be back any moment.,spongebob,1
I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!,not spongebob,0
"Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?",spongebob,1
Good idea.,not spongebob,0
Well?,spongebob,1
"Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work.",not spongebob,0
"Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!",spongebob,1
This is where our research money went?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!,spongebob,1
"An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, how do we know this contraption works?",not spongebob,0
Let's see a demonstration.,not spongebob,0
Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.,not spongebob,0
Me?  Are you sure this is safe?,not spongebob,0
As sure as I'm a doctor professor.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't you think we should test it?",spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
That's not exactly what I had in mind!,spongebob,1
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh I say, this is splendid.  Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this?  Oh marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.",not spongebob,0
"Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, lowly assistant.",not spongebob,0
"Oh I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!",not spongebob,0
Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.,spongebob,1
"Now it's tuning my ukulele!  Ouch! I say, was that necessary?  You sir, are impertinent.  Oh, dear.",not spongebob,0
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?  Um sorry, was that a yes?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?",not spongebob,0
It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!,not spongebob,0
Oh I really wish Sandy were here.,spongebob,1
All aboard!,not spongebob,0
Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?,not spongebob,0
"It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg.",not spongebob,0
What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?!,not spongebob,0
Sandy!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?!,not spongebob,0
Ouch.,not spongebob,0
It works! It works!,not spongebob,0
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?",not spongebob,0
I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.,not spongebob,0
We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.,not spongebob,0
"Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.",spongebob,1
"I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Don't push it.,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.",not spongebob,0
"My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels.  Good gracious! Can it be?",not spongebob,0
Try it again.,not spongebob,0
Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!,not spongebob,0
"Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.",not spongebob,0
"It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.",not spongebob,0
I accept.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.",not spongebob,0
Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.,not spongebob,0
"Now, now, one miracle at a time.",not spongebob,0
Goodbye!,not spongebob,0
"Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.",not spongebob,0
My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, mailman!",spongebob,1
"Okay,  see you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?",not spongebob,0
"Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!",spongebob,1
"That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!,spongebob,1
"This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!",spongebob,1
This guy's got shoes!,not spongebob,0
"Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?",spongebob,1
They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.,not spongebob,0
What kind of things?,spongebob,1
How should I know? Things people wanna buy.  Now keep your paws off my mail.,not spongebob,0
"That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!",spongebob,1
Is that gonna hurt?,not spongebob,0
"Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?",spongebob,1
Uh...  More time for thinking.,not spongebob,0
"No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.",spongebob,1
A chocolate bar?,not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!",spongebob,1
"Fancy living, here we come!",spongebob,1
Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.",spongebob,1
"Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?",spongebob,1
"Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. With or without nuts?",not spongebob,0
Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step!  Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?",spongebob,1
"Chocolate bars, eh?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!",spongebob,1
Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!,not spongebob,0
"No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, most certainly, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Well,  no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these!",not spongebob,0
Wow... what is it?,spongebob,1
"It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!",not spongebob,0
"But, I'm wasting my time.  You don't need these bags.",not spongebob,0
We need 'em! We need 'em!,not spongebob,0
"So long, boys! Happy hunting!  Suckers...",not spongebob,0
"Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!",not spongebob,0
Let's try next door!,spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?",spongebob,1
I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags.,not spongebob,0
We'll take twenty!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?",not spongebob,0
We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?,spongebob,1
That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.,not spongebob,0
"One chocolate bar, coming up!",spongebob,1
I don't have time for this.,not spongebob,0
I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice—,spongebob,1
Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
"—lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.",spongebob,1
Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!,not spongebob,0
"No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?",spongebob,1
He said we were mediocre...,not spongebob,0
That's it! He made us feel special!,spongebob,1
"Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, Patrick!",spongebob,1
Why don't we try being nice?,spongebob,1
"Oh, okay.",not spongebob,0
"Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
I love you.,not spongebob,0
"I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.",spongebob,1
Please. G-Go away!,not spongebob,0
"Um,  H-H-How you doin'?",spongebob,1
How am I doing?,not spongebob,0
Wanna buy some chocolate?,spongebob,1
We got him now!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?",not spongebob,0
"Hee hee, it tickles!",not spongebob,0
"As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.",not spongebob,0
You can keep that for five bucks.,not spongebob,0
I'll take ten!,not spongebob,0
We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Let's shake on it.,spongebob,1
Did you say something?,not spongebob,0
"Remember, Patrick, focus.",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.",spongebob,1
Why is Chubby here staring at me?,not spongebob,0
Focusing.,not spongebob,0
"Back up, Jack!",not spongebob,0
Nice place you got in here.,not spongebob,0
I can't understand what were doing wrong.,spongebob,1
I can't understand anything.,not spongebob,0
"There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!",spongebob,1
"Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.",not spongebob,0
They are most certainly not delicious!,spongebob,1
Not the way I use them!,not spongebob,0
Yet they sell millions of bags a day!,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!",spongebob,1
Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
"We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!",spongebob,1
The kill!,not spongebob,0
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, young lady.",spongebob,1
We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?,spongebob,1
Mom!,not spongebob,0
"What, what, what's all the yelling?",not spongebob,0
"You just can't wait for me to die, can you?",not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolate.,not spongebob,0
Chocolate?,not spongebob,0

"What, what are they selling?",not spongebob,0
Chocolates!,not spongebob,0

Chocolates!,not spongebob,0
I can't hear you!,not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolates!,not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolate?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.",not spongebob,0
I always hated it!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...",spongebob,1
You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.,not spongebob,0
"Live forever, you say? I'll take one.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, you lazy Mary!  Start rubbing me with that chocolate!",not spongebob,0
I hate you.,not spongebob,0
"If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!",spongebob,1
Hooray for lying!,not spongebob,0
It'll make your hair grow.,spongebob,1
Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!,not spongebob,0
They'll make you sound smart.,spongebob,1
I'll take twenty!,not spongebob,0
It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.,not spongebob,0
Just in time.,not spongebob,0
They'll make you fly!,spongebob,1
You'll fall in love!,not spongebob,0
They'll bring world peace!,spongebob,1
You'll walk through walls!,not spongebob,0
You'll rule the world!,spongebob,1
This'll be the best lie yet!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!",spongebob,1
What can I do for you boys?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
Small world. What's the matter with you guys?,not spongebob,0
"Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.",spongebob,1
"Ah, some guys have all the luck.",not spongebob,0
"I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.",not spongebob,0
"At night,  I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no...",not spongebob,0
Ow...,not spongebob,0
"Quick, Patrick, let's help him!",spongebob,1
"Careful, put him down gently.",spongebob,1
Ow...!,not spongebob,0
"Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?",spongebob,1
"Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars.",not spongebob,0
"Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!",not spongebob,0
"Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.",spongebob,1
"Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.",spongebob,1
I can live with that.,not spongebob,0
Let's change our names to Why and Bother.,spongebob,1
Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...,spongebob,1
No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!,not spongebob,0
Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you...  I'd like to buy all your chocolate.,not spongebob,0
Thank you for your patronage.,spongebob,1
"Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.",spongebob,1
But what are we going to spend it on?,not spongebob,0
"Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.",not spongebob,0
"But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs  and their dates.",not spongebob,0
"So, how long have you two ladies known each other?",spongebob,1
What? What did he say?,not spongebob,0
"And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate.",not spongebob,0
"Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho.  Oh! Hi.  I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club!  Hey, that's better!",not spongebob,0
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Potty! It is Christmas.  And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year.  Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now!",not spongebob,0
I sure am!  I'm ready!,spongebob,1
"Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae.  And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating.  I too am also preparing for Christmas.  Hmm, unbaked cookie dough!  Mmm...",not spongebob,0
Potty want cookie dough!  Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Potty! No!,not spongebob,0
Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Get out of here!,not spongebob,0
Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Potty!,not spongebob,0
Give us a lick!,not spongebob,0
"Back off, you flying freak!",not spongebob,0
Clarify please.,not spongebob,0

"Nice try, tiny cyclops, you won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily. But, preparation cannot be rushed, each batch much simmer for exactly 24 hours.",not spongebob,0
24 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Who took my blue blanky!?  Huh, this is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising.",not spongebob,0
Oh just taste it already!,not spongebob,0
"Well the smell doesn't make me wretch.  Hey, that ain't bad at all!  It's actually amazing!  This is gold in the form of chum!  Squidward my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star.",not spongebob,0
A star.,not spongebob,0
A star.,not spongebob,0
"Hello hungry eaters, it's time for, Flavors of the Bottom, a delectable at dining out at Bikini Bottom,  look with your host Perch Perkins!",not spongebob,0
"Hey all you bottom feeders! If you already eaten, well you might want to make room for seconds!   Cause' we are tasting Bikini Bottom's new upscale eatery, Le' Chum Bucket.  Look at all those classy diners. What's on the menu? It's called, Chum Fricassee.  Earlier, I spoke to head chef Squidward Tentacles. He shared with us why it's such a, Frica-success!",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I can't share the recipe with you, it's a secret.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"That's right Krabs , now we have a secret formula, and it's a bottle, and you can't have it!",not spongebob,0
"Give me that, please.  Thank you.",not spongebob,0
Secret!,not spongebob,0
"Shhhh , what's gotten into you?!  High fo-looting customers don't bark on the top of their lungs like a sea dog!",not spongebob,0
Reservation?! In this sinkhole?!,not spongebob,0
"What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well,  if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you.  Bon Appetit, Suckers!  See you in two years!",not spongebob,0
There's a two-year wait for a table.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, see how you like it Krabs!",not spongebob,0
One week later...,not spongebob,0
I was here first!,not spongebob,0
"No, I was!",not spongebob,0
"One at a time, please.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Tentacles, it's so nice to finally meet you!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, what's up?",not spongebob,0
Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!,not spongebob,0
What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours.,not spongebob,0
I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!,not spongebob,0
But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say.,not spongebob,0
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I will.  Please, sir. Take my chum. It's the least I can do to help. Poor guys.",not spongebob,0
"You go first, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is great!",spongebob,1
Better than a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
A what?,spongebob,1
This is delicious! No! I'm ruined!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world-famous Fricassee.  Grandma!",not spongebob,0
Someone's been cooking my recipe  and they're doing it wrong!,not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
Saving my recipe from my bumbling grandson!,not spongebob,0
"Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him!",not spongebob,0
"What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I admit it! I admit it! But--but what's the big deal?  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"The big deal is when the chum is not cooked for exactly 24 hours, it causes severe tummy trouble!",not spongebob,0
"You fed us, undercooked chum?!",not spongebob,0
"Tear him apart, people!",not spongebob,0
I've had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore!,not spongebob,0
Not the napkins!,not spongebob,0
"He got what he deserves, that's what I say!  It's on fire! It's all burning! Run!",not spongebob,0
My restaurant!,not spongebob,0
My fan base!,not spongebob,0
"I hope you learned your lesson, genius!",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all.",spongebob,1
"I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!",not spongebob,0
Ow!  Living the dream!,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?",not spongebob,0
I like neither. Can I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?",not spongebob,0
No. What will you have?,not spongebob,0
"Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?",not spongebob,0
"Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
"Psst, try the coral bits.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.",not spongebob,0
That'll be one dollar.,not spongebob,0
What's going on?,not spongebob,0
"Something stupid, I'm sure.",not spongebob,0
Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!,not spongebob,0
See? I told you.,not spongebob,0
What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!",not spongebob,0
A very dirty dollar?,not spongebob,0
"No, this is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir, you have just given me my one millionth dollar!",not spongebob,0
"Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing, now get out.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, what?",not spongebob,0
"Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar.",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, a trip!",spongebob,1
"I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where are we going? Fancy Springs?",not spongebob,0
No...,not spongebob,0
Pamper Island?,not spongebob,0
Try again...,not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Oh! Bikini Bottom Folk Village?,not spongebob,0
Better than that!,not spongebob,0
...clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?,not spongebob,0
"Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?",not spongebob,0
No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.,not spongebob,0
"Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?",spongebob,1
How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?,not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Hey, watch where you're swinging that!  SpongeBob, be careful with tha-   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, I've had enough...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose.  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya.  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, you stinking bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Here she comes...  ...she made it!,spongebob,1
"For a second or two, I thought she was a goner!",not spongebob,0
"So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back.  Never, never, never, never, never!",not spongebob,0
I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.,spongebob,1
"Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!",not spongebob,0
"You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious.  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, captain!",spongebob,1
"And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary.",spongebob,1
"We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar.  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get ya.",spongebob,1
"Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!  Look what we've got!",not spongebob,0
"Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon,  and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.",not spongebob,0
"Actually, it's Coral Blue number t-",spongebob,1
"I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.",not spongebob,0
"No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.",not spongebob,0
I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.,not spongebob,0
You're kidding?,not spongebob,0
Woo! Is it another fishing trip?,spongebob,1
No. It's this sandwich.,not spongebob,0
A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?,not spongebob,0
Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever, we've got plenty more to-  ...eat.",not spongebob,0
"Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!?",not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,spongebob,1
Just look at him!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you-",spongebob,1
Look again.,not spongebob,0
You're right. How do we get outta here?,spongebob,1
"If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. It's just a dumb old dollar! Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you.  Live bait.",not spongebob,0
"You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he'll come.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!  Get us out of here!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar...!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives.  Why couldn't it have been me?!",spongebob,1
"Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!",not spongebob,0
"Why did he have to go like this, why?!",spongebob,1
Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!,not spongebob,0
"Hello, boys!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?,not spongebob,0
"Wow, how did you get it back?",spongebob,1
"It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter, so eventually, we settled on a trade.",not spongebob,0
What did you give him?,spongebob,1
Nothing important.,not spongebob,0
"There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go.",not spongebob,0
"Wey, wook. It's Widward!",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Widward's woing to work.,spongebob,1
Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?,not spongebob,0
What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?,not spongebob,0
We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!",spongebob,1
"Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!",not spongebob,0
What did he say?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Something about his nose?,spongebob,1
"Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!",not spongebob,0
"Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!",not spongebob,0
That's what we've been trying to tell you!,not spongebob,0
We've been stuck up here for three days.,spongebob,1
We told you you wouldn't fit in.,not spongebob,0
"Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Ready!,not spongebob,0
Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!,not spongebob,0
"SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club!",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Make a wish, honey.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!",not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-T?!",not spongebob,0
"Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.",not spongebob,0
Well... this is the end.,not spongebob,0
"No it's not, Squidward!",spongebob,1
It's not?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!",spongebob,1
"And besides, we have this!",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!,not spongebob,0
"Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?",spongebob,1
Maybe someday.,not spongebob,0
Oooohhhh!,not spongebob,0
You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.",spongebob,1
The shell knows all!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?",spongebob,1
Nothing.,not spongebob,0
The shell has spoken!,not spongebob,0
Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!,not spongebob,0
I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!,not spongebob,0
"All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!!  I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!!  Ohhh, there's no way out of here...  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing.  As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky!",not spongebob,0
DUDE! We're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load!,not spongebob,0
Praise the Magic Conch!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.",not spongebob,0
It's a gift from the Magic Conch.,spongebob,1
"Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
Umm...uh..yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Once a member, always a member!",spongebob,1
To the club!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?",not spongebob,0
"Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.",spongebob,1
Maybe he's not a brother.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?",not spongebob,0
Neither.,not spongebob,0
Oh. Then how about the soup?,not spongebob,0
I don't think so.,not spongebob,0
Could I have anything to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm...  Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?",not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"All right!  Sorry, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Give me that!  Could I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Could I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Could I have something to eat!?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Can't you say anything else but no?!,not spongebob,0
Try asking again.,not spongebob,0
Can I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you all right?",spongebob,1
Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.,not spongebob,0
Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?!  Do you folks need some help?,not spongebob,0
I'm saved!  You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!,not spongebob,0
Magic... Conch... Shell?  You mean like this?!,not spongebob,0
The Magic Conch! A club member!,not spongebob,0
Uhhbuuuhhh...,not spongebob,0
My conch told me to come save you guys.,not spongebob,0
Hooray for the magic conches!,not spongebob,0

"Maybe I'll do a cute little button.  Or something a bit more manly perhaps.  Upturned might be good, too.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Great.  The idiot found me.,not spongebob,0
Whatcha doing?,spongebob,1
I'm picking a nose.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out.",spongebob,1
"I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with.",not spongebob,0
"But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a...  Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?",spongebob,1
With you? Absolutely not.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, come on, Squidward.  I can get you there lickety-split.",spongebob,1
"You can't dump your garbage here, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in.",spongebob,1
"Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out.",not spongebob,0
"You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon.",not spongebob,0
Ah. This is nice.,not spongebob,0
"Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home.",spongebob,1
Five minutes later...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help.",spongebob,1
I love you.,not spongebob,0
The bed is fine!,not spongebob,0
Fluff your pillow?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Fluff your IV bag?,spongebob,1
"Enough, you buffoon!",not spongebob,0
"Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful.",spongebob,1
"If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve.",spongebob,1
"Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—",spongebob,1
Grab a uniform out of the closet.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo!  Ooh! Candy stripes.  Strawberry.",spongebob,1
"Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here.",not spongebob,0
We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.,not spongebob,0
And what seems to be the problem today?,not spongebob,0
My throat hurts.,not spongebob,0
"Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?",not spongebob,0
"Wait a second! I think I've seen this before.  Mm, yeah.  Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken.",spongebob,1
"Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better.",not spongebob,0
"You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, doc.",not spongebob,0
"No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help.",spongebob,1
"What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?",not spongebob,0
So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—",not spongebob,0
Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time.  Ah!,spongebob,1

"Thanks, doc.",not spongebob,0
"Ready, set.",spongebob,1
"And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?",not spongebob,0
"Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
No! Not you!  What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine.",spongebob,1
You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.,not spongebob,0
Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Help me!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0

Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.,not spongebob,0
So awesome.,not spongebob,0
We were on our way to perform a surgery...,not spongebob,0

Order up!,spongebob,1
Yow! That shouldn't be in there.  Ooh!,spongebob,1
What?  Oh.,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"Nurse, sponge.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, nurse.",spongebob,1
I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!,not spongebob,0
I still can't see.,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse.",spongebob,1
What—what happened?,not spongebob,0
"I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!",not spongebob,0
"Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!",spongebob,1
"Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—",not spongebob,0
No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No-o-o-o!,not spongebob,0
"Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—",not spongebob,0
How's about the Squidward Classic?,spongebob,1
"Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it.",spongebob,1
D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work.,spongebob,1
But you're a doctor. You're at work.,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm just a fry cook.  But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye!",spongebob,1
Fry cook? Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market.",not spongebob,0
Sure is a nice day for a picnic.,not spongebob,0
Oh Herb! It's like a second honeymoon!,not spongebob,0
Just look at Timmy and Sally throwing the old disc around!,not spongebob,0
"C'mon and throw it, sis!",not spongebob,0
I just wanna say I'm gonna be real sad when you go off to college.,not spongebob,0
"Oh Sally, don't be such a goop! (SpongeBob appears, tears in his eyes) You know... I'll always be your big brother!",not spongebob,0
Is it starting to rain?,not spongebob,0
Nothing can spoil this perfect day!,not spongebob,0
What's the matter big brother got something in your eye?,not spongebob,0
Yeah... that's it... that must be it...,not spongebob,0
"Ha haw, now who's the goof? Just watch out because here it comes!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...",not spongebob,0
"PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!",not spongebob,0
I smell something burning.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. Probably my eye.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
You missed a spot.,not spongebob,0
"What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.",spongebob,1
"Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.",not spongebob,0
"Like what, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!",not spongebob,0
At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.,spongebob,1
"Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.",spongebob,1
Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!",not spongebob,0
Maybe Pete is just tired.,spongebob,1
"Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-",spongebob,1
No! Not his productivity!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!",spongebob,1
No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!,not spongebob,0
Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!,spongebob,1
Company picnic?,not spongebob,0
"See, look! He's already perking up!",spongebob,1
"Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?",not spongebob,0
Definitely!,spongebob,1
What's going on in here?,not spongebob,0
"Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!",not spongebob,0
"A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.",not spongebob,0
This is the greatest company picnic ever?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes it is.",not spongebob,0
"Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.",spongebob,1
Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.",not spongebob,0
Here's one!,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.",not spongebob,0
Right you are! Here's the food!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.",not spongebob,0
"Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Going long!,spongebob,1
"Ho, ho. This is so much fun.",not spongebob,0
Is this far enough?,spongebob,1
I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.",not spongebob,0
I'm going home.,not spongebob,0
Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!,not spongebob,0
"Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!",spongebob,1
"Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.",spongebob,1
"Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, This was the greatest...",not spongebob,0
Do not say it!,not spongebob,0
The greatest comp...,not spongebob,0
Don't!,not spongebob,0
The greatest company picnic ever!,not spongebob,0
"Well, looks like we've got company.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic.",spongebob,1
"Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.",not spongebob,0
I have? Wait. Oh yeah.,not spongebob,0
Chumpany Picnic? That's not how you spell Company Picnic!,not spongebob,0
Guess who?,not spongebob,0
Plankton!,not spongebob,0

"Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!",not spongebob,0
Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
You don't even have any employees!,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
Sure I do.,not spongebob,0
"Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.",not spongebob,0
A real disk?,spongebob,1
"Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!",not spongebob,0
Well. Eh.,spongebob,1
You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?",spongebob,1
"Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.",not spongebob,0
"The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...",not spongebob,0
Delicacies?,not spongebob,0
"And of course, the dunking booth!",not spongebob,0
Have you seen the calliope?,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
"Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...",not spongebob,0
"One side, Goopy!",not spongebob,0
Yum.,spongebob,1
"Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either.",not spongebob,0
"You were saying, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?",not spongebob,0
"Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
You want me to paint your face?,spongebob,1
"Well, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
"Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.",spongebob,1
Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.,not spongebob,0
Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!,not spongebob,0
"You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?",not spongebob,0
No. Course not.,spongebob,1
Are you sure you don't want to?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!",spongebob,1
You sure?,not spongebob,0
"100% sure, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!",not spongebob,0
You can never have too many!,not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squiddie-bird!",not spongebob,0
Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!,spongebob,1
It's a paper plate. Whoo!,spongebob,1
"Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.",spongebob,1
"I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...",not spongebob,0
"Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.",not spongebob,0
Ooh!  Me first! Me first!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.",not spongebob,0
That's such great advice!,not spongebob,0
"This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more!",not spongebob,0
"Ahem! Hello, Plankton!",spongebob,1
Uh oh.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!",spongebob,1
My candied pen!,not spongebob,0
"Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!",spongebob,1
No!,spongebob,1
Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...,spongebob,1
I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?,not spongebob,0
Whew! That was a cl...,not spongebob,0
"You saved me, boy. How did you do it?",not spongebob,0
"I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Unbelievable!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh.,not spongebob,0
The greatest company picnic ever!,spongebob,1
"Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work!",not spongebob,0
"More fruit punch, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"You know, Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?,spongebob,1
Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.,not spongebob,0
How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?,spongebob,1
Just lay face-down and keep still.,not spongebob,0
Alright. Party's over. Go home!,not spongebob,0
Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.,spongebob,1
"No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Nah! I feel fine!,spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
"Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!",spongebob,1
"You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off.  Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say Secret formula?",not spongebob,0
Se.. Se... for mama.,not spongebob,0
Se-cret Form-ula.,not spongebob,0
Se-cret Form-ula. Secret formula!,not spongebob,0
"Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.",not spongebob,0
"My name is SpongeBob SquarePants, and I want the secret formula.",not spongebob,0
"Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait!  Just keeping track of my copy.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?! You said you would take today off.,not spongebob,0
But I feel great today.,spongebob,1
Are you sure? Because you're sweating.,not spongebob,0
But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color.",spongebob,1
Morning.,not spongebob,0
Whatever.,not spongebob,0
Morning.,spongebob,1
"I said Whatever.  Wait, didn't I just... didn't I...",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare!  Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!,not spongebob,0
I'd like to place an order for two.,not spongebob,0
"Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!",not spongebob,0
That's me: The man of your dreams.,not spongebob,0
If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything!  I really am dreaming!,not spongebob,0
"What's your name, handsome stranger?",spongebob,1
My name is SpongeBob SquarePants.,not spongebob,0
Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common!  I always wanted a twin brother!  How do you feel about bubbles?,spongebob,1
I love them!,not spongebob,0
Jelly fishing?,spongebob,1
The same thing you do.,not spongebob,0
How about Squidward?,spongebob,1
"Oh, please.",not spongebob,0
I think I'll nickname you... Me two!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can't tell you that. It's a secret. By the way, my name is Me Two.",not spongebob,0
"Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula.  Time to adjust my plan.",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.",not spongebob,0
"You are too good to us, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?",not spongebob,0
How could I forget?  You had it tattooed on my hard drive.,not spongebob,0
"Now where was I? Oh, yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA.",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"No, no, SpongeCopy. We don't put dirty, nasty things in our mouth. Spit it out. ]",not spongebob,0
Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs  and ask him for the secret formula.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, secret formula. Got it.",not spongebob,0
And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!,not spongebob,0
Got it!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Ah! SpongeCopy!,not spongebob,0
"You see, this is why I never had children.",not spongebob,0
"Yup. I'm still dreaming.  Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream?  I heard you like your patties Ground!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming!  What's that under there?",not spongebob,0
Under where?,not spongebob,0
"That's right.  ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mr. Krabs. Hey, can you tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula?",not spongebob,0
"You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.",not spongebob,0
Secret formula.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy!",not spongebob,0
"He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, no! No!",not spongebob,0
Secret formula. Secret formula. Secret formu...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look. Another handsome devil.  We'll call you Me Three  Aww. Let's go flip some patties.",spongebob,1
"Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs.  March! March, my pretties, and learn the formula!",not spongebob,0
Secret Formula. Secret Formula.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only going to tell you the secret formula one more time!",not spongebob,0
One more time!,not spongebob,0
So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.,not spongebob,0
Yay! Hooray!,not spongebob,0
They all know the formula!,not spongebob,0
Let me do that!,not spongebob,0
Okay. Thanks.,spongebob,1
Let me do that!,not spongebob,0
Sure.,spongebob,1
I'll polish the pickles.,not spongebob,0
Looks like you sponges have everything covered.,spongebob,1
Mm hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?",spongebob,1
I came from the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
The Chum Bucket?,spongebob,1
♪I'm going to know the formula! I'm going to know the formula...♪,not spongebob,0
"Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.",spongebob,1
"Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!",not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.,spongebob,1
I feel funny.,not spongebob,0
Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!,spongebob,1
I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.,not spongebob,0
What does that mean?,spongebob,1
It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!,not spongebob,0
Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't!  No! Don't disappear!,spongebob,1
"Quickly, man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!",not spongebob,0
It's easy. You take one par... I don't feel so good,not spongebob,0
"Wait, no!",not spongebob,0
Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube...,not spongebob,0
What's the formula?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.",not spongebob,0
"Geez, what a cheapskate.  I can't believe I failed again!",not spongebob,0
I can believe it.,spongebob,1
"Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you see, it's...  Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge.  I can't believe they're all gone.",spongebob,1
You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, those imitations were my friends.",spongebob,1
One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake, and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip.",spongebob,1
"Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!",not spongebob,0
"Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three, two...  OW! Right on my keys!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?!  Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Uh-uh... Yes, sir?",not spongebob,0
"There's gonna be some changes around here.  A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab!  SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?",spongebob,1
All I wanted was change for the payphone.,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!  Monsieur's change.",spongebob,1
Thanks.  Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah!  Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?",not spongebob,0
"I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?",spongebob,1
"Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.",not spongebob,0
The money?,not spongebob,0
"And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.",not spongebob,0

Going on what?,not spongebob,0
The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!,spongebob,1
What talent could you possibly possess?,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"No one, not even your parents, would want to see that.  What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.",not spongebob,0
"Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!",spongebob,1
I can hardly wait.  Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.,not spongebob,0
We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...,not spongebob,0
Wow! A full house!  There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud!,spongebob,1

"Hey, Squid! How about this for the show?  The Amazing Mister Absorbency!  Ta-da!  Ta-da!",spongebob,1
No one is going to watch you engorge yourself.,not spongebob,0
"Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!",spongebob,1
So you really want to be in the show?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes!",spongebob,1
"Okay, you get to mop up afterwards.  Now will you stop bugging me?",not spongebob,0
"So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny!",spongebob,1
"Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home.  Thank you.

He has such a way with words.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation...  ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes.  First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience.",not spongebob,0
"Nice try. Your act's over, bub.",not spongebob,0
"You may win this time. She-hah-kazing!  Well, this stinks.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!  This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!,not spongebob,0
"Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.",not spongebob,0
"For your sake, I hope you're right.",not spongebob,0
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward!",not spongebob,0
What the?!,not spongebob,0
I'm losing money on this deal!,not spongebob,0
It's worth every penny.,not spongebob,0
You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!,not spongebob,0
No talent! No talent! No talent!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?",spongebob,1

SpongeBob!  Thanks?,not spongebob,0
"Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it.  What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time.",spongebob,1

"It's okay, we'll just see the next one.",spongebob,1
I'm afraid not. That was the last showing.,not spongebob,0
"Wow. Uh, what time is it?",spongebob,1
It is one minute to midnight.,not spongebob,0
One... minute... to midnight?!,spongebob,1
But that's when the Fisherman comes out!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!",spongebob,1
The Fisherman!  '' It's midnight! The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Phew. We made it.,spongebob,1
I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.,spongebob,1
It's like we're heroes.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
"Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?",not spongebob,0
"No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door.",spongebob,1
Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead?  Do you hear that?,not spongebob,0
I think it's coming from over there.,spongebob,1
It's the Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there.  Just a few steps that away.  In the dark? All alone?",spongebob,1
"Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?",spongebob,1
Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
What is wrong with you?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Squidward.",spongebob,1
What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!,not spongebob,0
We can't get home.,not spongebob,0
We're too scared.,spongebob,1
"Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, Squidwar...",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.",spongebob,1
Hat.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Here.",spongebob,1
I told those muttonheads not to see that movie.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Are you okay?,spongebob,1
Yeah! Are you okay?,not spongebob,0
I think so! Good night!,spongebob,1
"Yeah., good night! Just don't think about the Fisherman!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!",spongebob,1
"Oh, The Fisherman. The Fisherman. Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how!  No.  No.  Um... no.  Aha!  It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman.  This is gonna be good.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, hello? Someone there?  Uh, uh? What's that?  There's something stuck...  Huh.  Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left.  Oh, yeah. All right. Right there.",not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!,not spongebob,0
"Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!",spongebob,1
Oh.  There.,not spongebob,0
Now who's here?,spongebob,1
"Uh, someone's here?",not spongebob,0
You just said.,spongebob,1
Oh. The Fisherman's here.,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,spongebob,1
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I'm having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.,not spongebob,0
Quick. Block the door.,spongebob,1
There's just no sport in it.,not spongebob,0
Get everything?,spongebob,1
What about this? (Patrick holds Gary),not spongebob,0
Not Gary. Think it'll hold?,spongebob,1
"I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)",not spongebob,0
(scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again),not spongebob,0
Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)",spongebob,1
I'm the Deadly Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
(scream),not spongebob,0
"I guess this is the end, old buddy.",spongebob,1
I don't want to die in my underwear!,not spongebob,0
Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.,spongebob,1
Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. (Patrick takes off his underwear) Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!,not spongebob,0
(scream),not spongebob,0
That thing's eating Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, play 33. I need you to go long. And... break. You're going down, Fisherman!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window.  Okay! I think you got it!   Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oops.  Doink.  I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh?  Huh, I don't remember making such a mess.  And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti.  Nope.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hey, Patrick.  Wake up, Patrick!  Whoa!",spongebob,1
Whoa!,spongebob,1
"Patrick, no!",spongebob,1
No!,spongebob,1
Whew.,spongebob,1
Shh! Shhh!,spongebob,1
Uh-huh. Phew.,spongebob,1
What the?!,not spongebob,0
Ooh!  Ow!,spongebob,1
Bleach!  Ow!,spongebob,1
Mm. Ahh...,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, no!  Don't!",spongebob,1
Huh?,spongebob,1
Ohh!,spongebob,1
Whoa!,spongebob,1
Breezy.,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother.",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he'll be fine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob...",not spongebob,0
Check out our new balloon.,spongebob,1
Her name is Squeaky.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
New invention?!,not spongebob,0
See?,not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts.  Yoink!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!",not spongebob,0
"Pretty nifty, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do?  Vroom, vroom, vroom!",spongebob,1
"Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you heard Sandy.  We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this!",spongebob,1
"Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob.  Or..or this!",not spongebob,0
And under no circumstances should you ever touch this.  Boink.,spongebob,1
Whoa.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, so swirly.",spongebob,1
Look at all the colors.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you do, don't walk into it!",not spongebob,0
Can we skip into it?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now!  Now turn around.  Now walk.",not spongebob,0
Oh.  Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.,not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh!",spongebob,1
"Goodness.  Mm, mmm.",not spongebob,0
"Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one.",spongebob,1
Must be the boring dimension. Let's go home.,not spongebob,0
"Maybe there's an exit this way.  Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn.  Huh?  Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!",spongebob,1
I can't take it! Let me out of here!,not spongebob,0
Hmm. Huh?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Mm... Oh, Patrick, watch this!  Boink.",spongebob,1
"Whoops, sorry!",spongebob,1
"Heh, draw some more!",not spongebob,0
Nice décor.  Hmm.,spongebob,1
"Oh, my house!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!",not spongebob,0
"Oops, forgot to draw the ground.",spongebob,1
Ahh.,not spongebob,0
I'm starving.,not spongebob,0
"No problem.  Two patties coming right up!  Your doodle patty, sir.",spongebob,1
Tastes weird.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they are a little dry.",spongebob,1
I miss real Krabby Patties!,not spongebob,0
I miss Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
I miss Sandy.,not spongebob,0
I miss Gary.,spongebob,1
I miss Squidward!,not spongebob,0
You know who I miss most of all?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"But Patrick, I'm right here.",spongebob,1
"Aww, isn't he cute?",spongebob,1
How do you do?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh! He disappeared!  Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!",not spongebob,0
"He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.",spongebob,1
You doodle!,not spongebob,0
"Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hold on, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Oh, thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome.  I guess we need to be more careful.,spongebob,1
Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.,spongebob,1
"Oh, run!",not spongebob,0
"What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
We'll have to fight doodle with doodle.  Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad!  Attack!,spongebob,1
"Patrick, run!",spongebob,1
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm going in.  Cover me.",spongebob,1
"I gotcha, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Whoa!  What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?",spongebob,1
Over here.,not spongebob,0
"Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!",spongebob,1
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you!",spongebob,1
Good to know!,not spongebob,0
"Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of... SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table!  Charge!",spongebob,1
Ha-ha!,spongebob,1
Release my friend before I get really tough!,spongebob,1
I gotcha! I gotcha!,spongebob,1
Oof!,not spongebob,0
What are we gonna do?,not spongebob,0
In here.,spongebob,1
Phew.,spongebob,1
"Nah-nah, you missed us!  Now you gotta kiss us!",not spongebob,0
Nah-nah...,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, we'll never get back home!",spongebob,1
We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squeaky!  Squeaky!  Grab on, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Too slow, DoodleBob!",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Here, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Oh, ooh, uh... snip!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.",spongebob,1
But we're still stuck here.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home.  Wait a minute, Patrick!  Doodle us home, Sandy.",spongebob,1
Bleeble blobble blortex!,not spongebob,0
"Yay! Thanks, Sandy!",not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
"Hmm, mm-hmm...  What the—?",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, we're back!",spongebob,1
I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?,not spongebob,0
Sandy saved us.,spongebob,1
What?  Huh? Huh?,not spongebob,0
Give me back my nuts!,not spongebob,0
It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.,not spongebob,0
"I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?",spongebob,1
"Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Hey, learning tastes good.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I needed those.",spongebob,1
"Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.",not spongebob,0
57 times.,spongebob,1
"Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.",not spongebob,0
I'm a winner?,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner.,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner.,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?!,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!,spongebob,1
One minute thirty seven seconds later...,not spongebob,0
"How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.",not spongebob,0
"I didn't get a license, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Are they gonna mail it to you?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.",spongebob,1
"No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.",not spongebob,0
"Let's just go home, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.",spongebob,1
"Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. No!",spongebob,1
Good morning.,not spongebob,0
You're not the judge of me!,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I am. Let the testing begin!",not spongebob,0
I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm here for you, buddy.",spongebob,1
I passed my test!,not spongebob,0
You got a perfect score?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.",not spongebob,0
Perfect score.,spongebob,1
"Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license.",not spongebob,0
"Stand behind the line, sir.",not spongebob,0
How do I look?,not spongebob,0
Like a winner.,spongebob,1
Ready?,not spongebob,0
Ready.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.",not spongebob,0
Does that mean I get a free key chain?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, no.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.,not spongebob,0
Yeah! All right!,not spongebob,0
Women will want you.  Men will want to be you.  You'll be the envy of your friends.,not spongebob,0
Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.,not spongebob,0
I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!,spongebob,1
"The horn works.  Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.",spongebob,1
Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.,not spongebob,0
Two millionth?,spongebob,1
Then you can get a free boat just like me.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, just like you.",spongebob,1
I try to serve as an inspiration to others.,not spongebob,0
Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.,spongebob,1
"I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for the ride, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
"I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep.",not spongebob,0
"4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?",spongebob,1
You will never guess what happen to me today.,not spongebob,0
You got your license.,spongebob,1
Yeah!  But that's not all.,not spongebob,0
You got a new boat.,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life.",not spongebob,0
Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.",spongebob,1
"Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.",not spongebob,0
Thanks for the ride.,spongebob,1
"No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license.",not spongebob,0
That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.",not spongebob,0
When did we get a drive-thru?,spongebob,1
I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.,not spongebob,0
I used to have a dream.,spongebob,1
Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I—",spongebob,1
"The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"What's with the helmet, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image.",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"Boy, driving is so easy.",not spongebob,0
Oh?,spongebob,1
Do you want me to give you lessons?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that would be great.",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?",not spongebob,0
"What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.",not spongebob,0
"That's great, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.",not spongebob,0
Mom!,spongebob,1
"Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.",not spongebob,0
Hey.,spongebob,1
Even Patrick has a license.,not spongebob,0
Let's see what this baby can do.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah.",not spongebob,0
40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.,spongebob,1
What? Where? Who?,not spongebob,0
"Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?",spongebob,1
"Umm... okay.  Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale.",not spongebob,0
"Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!",spongebob,1
So?,not spongebob,0
You're suppose to stop!,spongebob,1
I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.,not spongebob,0
Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!,spongebob,1
They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?,not spongebob,0
"I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!",spongebob,1
"How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!",not spongebob,0
"If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!",spongebob,1
I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!",spongebob,1
"Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force.",not spongebob,0
It's the police!,not spongebob,0
"Pull it over, litterbug!",not spongebob,0
Litterbug?! No!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I got me a runner.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what do you think you're doing?",spongebob,1
I don't know! I don't have a license anymore.,not spongebob,0
90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.,not spongebob,0
"So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.",not spongebob,0
What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.,spongebob,1
"Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days!",not spongebob,0
One debt to society later...,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, then what do we do with this?",spongebob,1
How's that?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
"Ready, buddy?",not spongebob,0
"Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin'?",spongebob,1
"Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.",not spongebob,0
Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.,not spongebob,0
"And why is that, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Because then you'd only get to repair it once.,not spongebob,0
"So, what flavor is it?",spongebob,1
"It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.",not spongebob,0
"No, I mean the toothpaste!",spongebob,1
Oh. Well I think it's...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium-sized hole in the wall!",spongebob,1
Time to get out the dental floss. Ha!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks again for taking us to the Krusty Krab, dad.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Mom never brings us here!,not spongebob,0
Ha. Any time kids.  What the?,not spongebob,0
Careful now...,spongebob,1
"Hey, you guys put in a drive thru!",not spongebob,0
We did?,not spongebob,0
"Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and two extra large orders of Krabby Rings.  Is this toothpaste?",not spongebob,0
"Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive thru!",not spongebob,0
A drive--- whoa!,spongebob,1
Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.,not spongebob,0
You mean for you.,not spongebob,0
It'll cost you money.,not spongebob,0
"Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?",not spongebob,0
"I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go. It even lights up, see?",spongebob,1
"Well, that's great SpongeBob, but I already got a bunch of stuff that's better: A menu board made with old napkins and packing tape, a microphone I made with some rusty tin cans I found, and this sign... I made from an old noodle.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than the things I bought?",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, what?",not spongebob,0
How is this stuff better?,spongebob,1
Because it was...  Free!,not spongebob,0
"I'll have a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty,  and a medium drink.",not spongebob,0
"Comin' right up, sir.  SpongeBob, I need a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, and a medium drink.",not spongebob,0
"I'll have that ready in two shakes in a lamprey's tail!  That oughta' fix it!  Thank you, come again.",spongebob,1
"Yes, you like it here, don't you?  Can I help you?  A bill?! What's this for?",not spongebob,0
"It's for my dry cleaning. It seems as though your new drive-through window is a little on the challenge side.  Size-wise, I mean.",not spongebob,0
"There, problem solved!",not spongebob,0
Meanwhile...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.",not spongebob,0
Excuse me? I'd like to place an order please.,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wonderful. Peachy... Now how am I supposed to get to SpongeBob so I can hand him these order tickets here?",not spongebob,0
Problem solved!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Hi!,spongebob,1
Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone to college.,not spongebob,0
"Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible:  By ordering one!  Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra secret formula!  Hello?! Is this stupid thing on?!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward! Any customers?,not spongebob,0
None that I can hear.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Here comes one now!,not spongebob,0
Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around!,not spongebob,0
Large Krabby Patty with fries please.,not spongebob,0
With fries. Got it. We'll have that right out to you sir.,not spongebob,0
What? You're closed?! Now she tells me...,not spongebob,0
"There you are sir. The ketchup's in the b--  What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty?  Nobody, huh? Okay, I'll just toss it in the trash.",not spongebob,0
Later...,not spongebob,0
I sure am in a jovial mood! How about you guys?,not spongebob,0
"You bet, Pearl!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm feeling especially jovial. You know, being a teenager and all!",not spongebob,0
Welcome to the Krusty Krab drive thru. Can I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you guys. It sounds like that weird guy Squidward. What do you say we play a prank on him?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Sounds like a great idea to me! Being a teenager and all!  Two large Krabby Patties, please!  With fries!",not spongebob,0
Owwwww! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurt. A lot.,not spongebob,0
A bill?! And what is this for?,not spongebob,0
It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!,not spongebob,0
You have any idea how much a real microphone and speaker cost?!,not spongebob,0
How much?,not spongebob,0
Well... they cost as much as... as uh... as a... real microphone and... speaker.,not spongebob,0
Just then.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa. Woopsie!",not spongebob,0
Hey! You delinquent!,not spongebob,0
Now you'll have to replace it.,not spongebob,0
Replace what?,not spongebob,0
The microphone!,not spongebob,0
"What do I look like, I'm made out of tin cans?",not spongebob,0
"No, but that pile of tin cans over there is.",not spongebob,0
Good thing we got you around to always point out the obvious.,not spongebob,0
Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry about that, dude.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's nice!  I'm still billing you for the damages!",not spongebob,0
One Krabby Meal! To go!,spongebob,1
Hand it on up here!,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Larry!",spongebob,1
"Come on, bro! You can do it!  Or maybe not.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'm concerned.",spongebob,1
"Oh? Why, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's S.U.B.!,spongebob,1
Yeah... Well there's a solution to every problem!  There! Problem solved!  Hey! What's all the ruckourous about!? Whoa...,not spongebob,0
Hey! What's the hold up?!,not spongebob,0
How long you gonna make us wait?!,not spongebob,0
We're waiting here for hours!,not spongebob,0
We're still waiting... in our driveway!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!,not spongebob,0
That's nice.  That's interesting.,not spongebob,0
I guess I'll be retiring early after all!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Eugene Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Yes?  What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!,not spongebob,0
"A ticket?  Now why would I write you a ticket? Huh? Oh, I know! How about for turning the whole town into a parking lot?!",not spongebob,0
Ah! But officer! I a... I a... Listen!,not spongebob,0
"Relax man, that's just my order. I want two Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go!  I don't wait in lines!",not spongebob,0
"Oh sure! Right! Phew!  SpongeBob, can you get the kind officer two-",not spongebob,0
"-Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!",spongebob,1
"There you go, officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome. Just hope the mayor doesn't find out about this mess. He's the one you need to worry about!  Mayor.,not spongebob,0
Eugene Krabs!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Mayor!,not spongebob,0
The whole town is in a stand-still because your drive thru is so slow!,not spongebob,0
"Well... don't you worry, Mr. Mayor! There's an answer for that, too!  There you go! See, now we got two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast!",not spongebob,0
Hmm! That should work perfectly!,not spongebob,0
Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra chee-?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Order up!,not spongebob,0
I'm on it!,spongebob,1
"Hurry, SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!",not spongebob,0
26 orders up!,spongebob,1
"No, no, no! Not that window! The other one!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you sure?! These customers over here look really, really hungry!",spongebob,1
And these ones don't?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey, watch it, will ya?! I just had this thing repainted!",not spongebob,0
And I just had this repainted!,not spongebob,0
I see you used the extra-glossy...,not spongebob,0
Chum nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're runny! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off...  for me!  Oh no... not again.,not spongebob,0
Oh darn it! Now there's a line!,not spongebob,0
"Watch where you're going, old man! This is the second time!",not spongebob,0
I'm too old to wait in lines!,not spongebob,0
Chum Nuggets... get 'em before  my arm falls off...,not spongebob,0
They're everywhere!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Stay back! Take Squidward, not me!  Oh, hi Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! We gotta do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!,spongebob,1
"For once, he's right!",not spongebob,0
"Easy, boys! Easy! Don't you think you're both getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right?  Like-  Oh... kay... Don't worry!  I can solve this!  More drive thrus! More money!",not spongebob,0
Hey? Is somebody eating potato chips?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs!  We can fix it!  We might need to buy some more toothpaste though.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Tag, you're it!  Gary will never find me here!  Uh-oh.  Tag! Now I'm it!",spongebob,1
"Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?",not spongebob,0
Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?,spongebob,1
"Oh boy, would I!",not spongebob,0
"Okay,  Tag, you're it!",spongebob,1
"I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!  Tag, you're it! I win, I win!  What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat!",not spongebob,0
That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!,spongebob,1
It tickles!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary.  Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.  What about you, Gary?  Gary? Gary?",spongebob,1
"Brush brush brush, brush brush brush…",not spongebob,0
"Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?",spongebob,1
"Brush brush brush,  Brushin' everywhere…  Nope.  Oh, hey, here he is!",not spongebob,0
"Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's a great idea!",spongebob,1
"A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games…",not spongebob,0
"Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.",spongebob,1
"And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…",not spongebob,0
"OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
Blah blah blah blah blah…,not spongebob,0
I'm awake!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?",spongebob,1
"Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows!  See?",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee!  Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me?  You're not chasing me…",spongebob,1
"Come on, Gary, let's play a different game.",not spongebob,0
"Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of…  …you… What's wrong with me?  Do I offend?  Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball!  Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip!  Huh? Huh-huh?  Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head!  All right, that's it!  Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!",not spongebob,0
What's that supposed to mean?,spongebob,1
"I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.",not spongebob,0
"Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way, Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary!",spongebob,1
"Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me…  ...for all that I've done?!  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da.  Bon appetite, Lary.  Okay, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I…  I guess you can sleep there…  I'll sleep down here.  Well, good night, Lary.  Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?!  Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?!  Gary?",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Gary.",spongebob,1
Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?,not spongebob,0
Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…,spongebob,1
"And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?",not spongebob,0
Soap? But… we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'…,spongebob,1
Here it comes…,not spongebob,0
"Du… du… duuuuu…  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you!  I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?",spongebob,1
How pathetic…,not spongebob,0
Gary…?,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww…  Let's go for a walk, pal!",spongebob,1
Gary? I thought what we had was special...!,not spongebob,0
"Order up, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?",not spongebob,0
To go home?,not spongebob,0
"No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy!",not spongebob,0
"That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah.",spongebob,1
I Heart you...,not spongebob,0
"Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it.",not spongebob,0
"I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?",spongebob,1
It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of?,not spongebob,0
Eyelashes!,spongebob,1
Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?,not spongebob,0
After you present your brotherhood gift.,not spongebob,0
I'll buy the little twerp a Gumball.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.",not spongebob,0
The only thing I'm making is for the exit.,not spongebob,0
"Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears.",spongebob,1
"I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.",not spongebob,0
Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?,not spongebob,0
"Heave-ho!  If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one.",not spongebob,0
"Wait!  We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.",not spongebob,0
"So, what flavor is it?",not spongebob,0
Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.",not spongebob,0
"Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  To SpongeBob... Well, here you go.",spongebob,1
And that's what happened!,not spongebob,0
25 dollars?! A bomb?!,not spongebob,0
In the Krusty Krab?!,not spongebob,0
That's where you left it.,not spongebob,0
It's not there.,not spongebob,0
"Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala.",spongebob,1
You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?,not spongebob,0
Kill him?,not spongebob,0
"Here's your order, sir.",spongebob,1
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
"No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!",not spongebob,0
"Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!",not spongebob,0
You've seen this before?,not spongebob,0
Eleven times as a matter of fact.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?",not spongebob,0
"Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it!",not spongebob,0
Note to self: Watch out for Squidward.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.",not spongebob,0
"Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two...",spongebob,1
"Please, don't do that.",not spongebob,0
What's the part two?,spongebob,1
"Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.",spongebob,1
"Great. Uh, let me see it.",not spongebob,0
"The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.",spongebob,1
Everything's in red.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I know.",spongebob,1
We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.,not spongebob,0
"Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.",spongebob,1
"Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.",not spongebob,0
"Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over.",not spongebob,0
"Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.",spongebob,1
Which is...?,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.,spongebob,1
You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?,not spongebob,0
"That's a good one Squidward!  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.",spongebob,1
Who's there?,not spongebob,0
I am!,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah...",not spongebob,0
"Look out, everyone, friends in reverse!",spongebob,1
"Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.",spongebob,1
I can't breathe.,not spongebob,0
Are you sure you should be poking it like that?,not spongebob,0
Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is...,spongebob,1
Does it involve more dismemberment?,not spongebob,0
Watch the sunset with Squidward.,spongebob,1
Sunset?,not spongebob,0
"The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later.",spongebob,1
"C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us.",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Explosions... I mean, erosion.",not spongebob,0
"You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.",spongebob,1
Four... three... two... one...,not spongebob,0
I guess we started too early. Let's start again.,spongebob,1
"Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.",spongebob,1
Why are you still here?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.",spongebob,1
"Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!",not spongebob,0
You want me to explode?,spongebob,1
Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!,not spongebob,0
"Um, okay, I'll try.  Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it!  Now it's your turn!",spongebob,1
That's not what I meant you barnacle head!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, good one.",spongebob,1
No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!,not spongebob,0
Why would I do that?,spongebob,1
Because the pie you ate was a bomb!,not spongebob,0
What pie?,spongebob,1
"The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!",not spongebob,0
"Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops!",spongebob,1
Ouch.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Do you know what today is?,spongebob,1
Annoy Squidward Day?,not spongebob,0
"No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?",not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs gives you that award, so you'll work harder for no extra money.",not spongebob,0
"That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder.",spongebob,1
"Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.",spongebob,1
"Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.",not spongebob,0
Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!,spongebob,1
Need some help?  What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Making...Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of--  ...garbage.,not spongebob,0
Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!,spongebob,1
"I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!",not spongebob,0
"That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...",spongebob,1
It's a symbol that you're a chump!,not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward!",spongebob,1
And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.,spongebob,1
"I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!",not spongebob,0
What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!,spongebob,1
"Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!",not spongebob,0
"But, sir…",spongebob,1
"There's no room for buts in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?",not spongebob,0
"Crystal, sir!",spongebob,1
Good! Now move out!,not spongebob,0
I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What are you doing here?!,not spongebob,0
You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!,spongebob,1
"Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!",not spongebob,0
That can be arranged.,spongebob,1
"You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.",spongebob,1
Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!,not spongebob,0
I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!",spongebob,1
Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!",spongebob,1
I don't need to sleep! Loser!,not spongebob,0
"Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.",spongebob,1
"I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?",spongebob,1
"No, how about you?",not spongebob,0
Nope!  Nighty Night.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?",spongebob,1
I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!,not spongebob,0
"All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!,spongebob,1
That oughta hold him!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Why, you little…!",not spongebob,0
"Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!",spongebob,1
"So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?",not spongebob,0
Truce.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!",not spongebob,0
You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.,spongebob,1
"Okay, let's have a good clean fight.",not spongebob,0
"And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!",spongebob,1
"Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.",not spongebob,0
As soon as he stops shaking my hand...,spongebob,1
...I'm gonna make a run for it.,not spongebob,0
"Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!",spongebob,1
"Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
What's going on here?!,not spongebob,0
"It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0

Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it.",not spongebob,0

Trying to have a relaxing evening.,not spongebob,0

All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax  in peace!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, Squidward is really really sad...",spongebob,1
You're right. Let's go poke someone else.,not spongebob,0
"How about instead, we do something extra special for him! Then he won't be sad anymore!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I get it. It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all of Gary's... I mean feed Gary for a week.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it",spongebob,1
Vow?,not spongebob,0

Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break.  Ahh.,spongebob,1
That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out.,not spongebob,0
I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo!,spongebob,1
"Oh, hey, how about this?",not spongebob,0
That's awesome!,spongebob,1
Ooh. I know that sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?,not spongebob,0

Funny faces make me laugh!,not spongebob,0
What?! Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?,not spongebob,0
"Why, is there something wrong?",spongebob,1
"Haven't ye ever heard the saying If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Let me tell you the story of face freeze.  It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was sticking his tongue at people.",not spongebob,0
How rude!,not spongebob,0
"Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out...",not spongebob,0
"Huh, huh... Huh?",not spongebob,0
...permanently!,not spongebob,0
Weirdo.,not spongebob,0
No... no!,not spongebob,0
"He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?",not spongebob,0
Mm-mm.,not spongebob,0
Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.,not spongebob,0
I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.,spongebob,1
Done and done.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.,spongebob,1
"Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. This is...  easy. How you holding up?,spongebob,1
"Huh, fine. You?",not spongebob,0
Dun ah eeh.,not spongebob,0
Hey!  Patrick.  Patrick!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.,spongebob,1
"Gosh, you're right.",not spongebob,0
"Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.",spongebob,1
You mean like this?  Ree eeh eeh!,not spongebob,0
Aye yi yi yi!,not spongebob,0

Awoot duh doo!,spongebob,1
Looo ooo ooo!,not spongebob,0
Day ah dah da dah!,spongebob,1
"I can't breathe!  Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.",spongebob,1
"Yes! But, how to choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross,  uh? And then slip into an overbite.  And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.",not spongebob,0
"Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one...  The Gary. Meow!",spongebob,1
"Gloriously disgusting, sir.",not spongebob,0
Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea.,spongebob,1
You two need help.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
It never gets so old!,spongebob,1
Do you mind?!,not spongebob,0
Mind what? Making faces? Of course were don't.,spongebob,1
"You got that right, pal! What a silly question.",not spongebob,0
"Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face.",spongebob,1
I don't wanna make faces. I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!,not spongebob,0
That's a good one right there.,spongebob,1
"Oh, good one, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!",spongebob,1
Oh yeah? Watch me.,not spongebob,0
Whatever works.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!",spongebob,1
"Actually, I can't move my face at all.",not spongebob,0
I can't move my face either!,spongebob,1
All right! We did it!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right!  Patrick, we have the face freeze!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!",spongebob,1
Sandy! Sandy!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.",not spongebob,0
"And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"Well, I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension.  You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. I can feel them knots just meltin' away. Let's see if I can just finesse that jaw line back in place.  Phew! Okay, you two. Bad news first. That wicked face freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hey, you all right, boy? Eh, look a little cattywampus walking in here.",not spongebob,0
"Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'...",spongebob,1
"Ahem. Uh, but what's with the skewed posture?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.",spongebob,1
Penny? Where?! Where?!,not spongebob,0
That'll buy me some time.,spongebob,1
"Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are piling up.",not spongebob,0
"I'm on it, Squidward!  Onion juice! Ah!",spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay.  Ow! Phew. Order up.",spongebob,1
"You deliver it, I'm on break.",not spongebob,0
"Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny.  Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance.,spongebob,1
"Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...",not spongebob,0
"Your order is served, sir.",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear.",spongebob,1
I'm taking my clams elsewhere.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, come back!",not spongebob,0
"Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?",spongebob,1
What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?,not spongebob,0
"Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts.",spongebob,1
"Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o.  So I can see your face.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs?  My impersonation of a burrito!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh. Is this a bad time, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I see what's going on here.  Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories.",spongebob,1
"I'm losing business because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah!  No! I can't move me face. I've got the face freeze, too!",not spongebob,0
What is the hold up in here—?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! you could get the face freeze!",spongebob,1
"Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too!  This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh.  Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done.",not spongebob,0

First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams.  Coochie coochie coo.,not spongebob,0

"Ooh, aww.",not spongebob,0
I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along.,not spongebob,0

"Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that was egg-citing.",spongebob,1
The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.,not spongebob,0

Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy?  That tickles.,spongebob,1
"Uh, could somebody hand me those?",spongebob,1

Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.,spongebob,1

"Bye, Old Man Jenkins!",not spongebob,0
"Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens.",spongebob,1
"Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, you think we just imagined it?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, probably— A UFO!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.",spongebob,1
Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?,not spongebob,0
New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,spongebob,1
What?! That is totally unfair!,not spongebob,0
Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or--,spongebob,1

"Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula!  Why aren't you laughing?",not spongebob,0
I've heard this joke before.,not spongebob,0
"All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw! Day 3!",not spongebob,0

"Um, you're making me nervous.",spongebob,1

Hypnosis?!,spongebob,1
"Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked.

It worked! I'm cured!,spongebob,1
But what about the formula?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!",spongebob,1
"No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick!",not spongebob,0
"Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.",spongebob,1

"No, seriously. Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!  Hey, kiddies! It's your old pal, Patchy, floating somewhere over Bikini Bottom. I sailed down here to witness something that only happens every 100 years. Why, me and my trusted parrot, Potty, wouldn't miss it for the world, would we, Potty? Potty?",not spongebob,0
Rah!  I'm just here for the buffet.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty!  Give me that!  Potty, I told you to leave those fish alone! What do you think you are, a seahawk?",not spongebob,0
I can't help if I was born a predator. Rah!,not spongebob,0

Since when is the moon so green?,spongebob,1
"Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, SpongeBob.  It's just been up there so long, it's getting moldy.  Oh, but I'd still eat it.",not spongebob,0
"That ain't the moon, guys. The real moon comes out at night, remember? Something's fishy going on here.",not spongebob,0

"Yeah, walk outside and check out this awesome moon.",not spongebob,0
"Hello? Hello, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"No! Not me!  Huh? I guess it only effects sea creatures, but I still don't get why that green moon is turning everyone into wild swimming fish?  Am I the only one left?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, whoever used that restroom last was an animal!  Hey, put me down! Sandy! What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!  What is the meaning of—",not spongebob,0
Get in the shade!,not spongebob,0

"Ah, Sandy Cheeks.  How is it hanging?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's not hanging too good, Frenchy. You see, there's this—",not spongebob,0
"Don't say another word. I have been monitoring the behavior of the green moon all day. It is called Neptune's Moon. Every 100 years, it de-evolves everyone in Bikini Bottom into primal fish for two hours.",not spongebob,0
Two hours?,not spongebob,0
Until it falls into another volcano and is extinguished.,not spongebob,0
"I knewed it was nature, dagnabit! That's a relief. So I just have to keep Squidward in the shade for a couple of hours.  Whew! Thanks, Frenchy.",not spongebob,0
I'm going home to hide under the covers! It's every cephalopod for himself!,not spongebob,0
"Frenchy, I gotta call you back!  Squidward, you have to stay in the shade!",not spongebob,0
Help!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! No!,not spongebob,0
"O.M. Jehoshaphat! You don't see that everyday.  My friends are gonna be lunch if I don't think fast!  SpongeBob! Patrick!  Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs!  Larry!  Yeeouch!  Look out, Pearl! I'll save you!

"Here's where we get off!  Thanks for the lift, Pearl! Don't you worry. Nobody's going to eat you guys on my watch.  Ow!  Dinner time! Come and get it!  This is so fascinating, Frenchy. Tell me more about my fishy friends. Oh, wait. I'll put you on speaker phone.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the lobster. The cockroach of the sea. Skittering across the ocean floor, the lobster sheds its skin once a week... And then eats it.",not spongebob,0
"Now that's what I call recycling, huh, Frenchy?",not spongebob,0
"Ah, notice the scavenger crab eating garbage  unaware he is being stalked by his natural predator, the puffer fish.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, you don't.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"I knew I was gonna have to separate you two.  You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.  Ow!  Yeowch!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, observe how the hungry sea star ejects his own stomach from his body in order to eat his meal,  where the primitive sea sponge filters nutrients and oxygen from bacteria particles.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob is never gonna believe this.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the giant octopus. One of the largest predators on the ocean floor.",not spongebob,0
"Texas toast! It's a good thing my treedome is made of ten tons of pressure proof glass, huh, Frenchy?",not spongebob,0
"Oui, Sandy, that is true, but, unfortunately, the poisonous and highly intelligent octopus can also cut through hard bedrock with its beak.",not spongebob,0
"You don't see that everyday! Squidward, no!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa!  Oh!  Hi-yah!  Aah, hominy grits!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the battle for the survival of the fittest rages on in the animal kingdom.",not spongebob,0
My friends! My tree!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, you must remember, who is the natural enemy of the octopus?",not spongebob,0
That's a great idea.,not spongebob,0
"Using her versatile tail, the Texas Land squirrel calls out to the natural enemy of the octopus.",not spongebob,0
"There she blows, y'all!",not spongebob,0
The whale.,not spongebob,0
"Sick 'em, Pearl! Sorry, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Ohh!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Two hours is up? Thank goodness.,not spongebob,0
And so we bid a fond adieu to Neptune's Moon as it descends back into the Earth from whence it came. We will see it again in 100 years.  Goal!,not spongebob,0
Oops.,not spongebob,0
What is going on here?  My clothes!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Aah!,not spongebob,0
"Um, Sandy, how come your treedome is broken and everyone's naked?",spongebob,1
"Well, SpongeBob, let's just say this has been the most interesting birthday I ever had.",not spongebob,0
"And, of course, Neptune's Moon is always followed by Neptune's Sun.",not spongebob,0
You don't see that everyday. Jinx! Buy me a patty!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, Bikini Bottom. Teaming with life and naked mysteries. This next whale song is going out to my favorite squirrel. Sandy, happy birthday.",not spongebob,0
Yee haw! Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, Potty, I never thought it'd end up like this, brunch for a shark.",not spongebob,0
"I guess this is it. Good-bye, Patchy.",not spongebob,0
"Good-bye, Potty.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
"Frenchy, you surprising scallywag! Get—What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
"Ah, Patchy the pirate, I just swam back to warn you about Neptune's Sun, but it's too late. Au revoir.",not spongebob,0
Bye. Neptune's Sun?  What's happening?!,not spongebob,0
"Mm, yummy.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished. I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?",not spongebob,0
"Hark, the odor you seek is before you.",not spongebob,0
"At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  And served with a smile by our friendly waiter.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.",spongebob,1
Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, cause you're the mascot.",spongebob,1
"Nah, I don't think so!  We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays!",spongebob,1
"Oh, for dolphins sakes! Do tell what's troubling you so!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.,spongebob,1
Shocking.,not spongebob,0
I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimic.,spongebob,1
Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.,not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"That'll keep him out of my hair.  Of course, he actually has one.  To each, his own.",not spongebob,0
Mustard!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your freakishness.",not spongebob,0
"Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal.",not spongebob,0
Good riddance.  What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!",not spongebob,0
"Ok, let's not overdo it.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist!  He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!",not spongebob,0
"Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.",not spongebob,0
"It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!",not spongebob,0
"Ohh, what is this?",spongebob,1
This is an authentic Fiasco!,not spongebob,0
A Fiasco?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"An original Fiasco, you say?",not spongebob,0
He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!,not spongebob,0
Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.,not spongebob,0
What's your asking price?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.",not spongebob,0
Hold it!   I'll take a million for it.,not spongebob,0
It's not yours to sell! I found it!,not spongebob,0
"Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco.",not spongebob,0
You tried to throw it away!  It's mine!,not spongebob,0
"Let's not be hasty. It belongs to…neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out.   It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure!  And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed!  And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest!",not spongebob,0
"Ready for duty, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.",not spongebob,0
"Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece!  Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!",not spongebob,0
"Two Krabby Patties, please.",not spongebob,0
Each!,not spongebob,0
"So, what have you got for me today, huh?  No Krabby Patty in sight.  What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty!  Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.",not spongebob,0
I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying!  Stop that thief!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
"Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free!",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!  What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage!  What's going on?,not spongebob,0
How long do you think we'll be here?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.,not spongebob,0
Mine does too.,not spongebob,0
"Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!",not spongebob,0
Don't move!,not spongebob,0
"Achoo!  Blasted pollen allergies!  Ahh, I should be safe in space.",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
You gotta be kidding me!  Hello? Hello?  Open up!  Open up!,not spongebob,0
Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, what?  Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'!  Ok you two, against the wall!  That's it. Nice and slow.  You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!",not spongebob,0
"I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.,spongebob,1
Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.",spongebob,1
You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?,not spongebob,0
"No, you need to turn yourself in.",spongebob,1
"Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!",not spongebob,0
Who's that?,spongebob,1
"Me, you imbecile!",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
"Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Now you've gone too far!,spongebob,1
"No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!",not spongebob,0
I can't believe you're calling me that!,spongebob,1
"Believe it, Man Boy!",not spongebob,0
Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you eating?",spongebob,1
The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  Not bad.,not spongebob,0
Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!,spongebob,1
"Ohh, he's an accomplice too!",not spongebob,0
"Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.",not spongebob,0
"Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon.  You're all under arrest until we figure this out.",not spongebob,0
But what do you mean all?  I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution.",spongebob,1
Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.,not spongebob,0
"My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.",spongebob,1
X-rays tickle.,not spongebob,0
Such artistic genius!  I'll never paint again!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, don't I get a phone call?",not spongebob,0
"Wake up, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
We're moving today!,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!",spongebob,1
"Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!!  ...To me!",spongebob,1
"What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today, I caught something terrible.",not spongebob,0
What'd ya catch?,not spongebob,0
I caught sight of the calendar.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.",not spongebob,0
I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?,not spongebob,0
You just missed him.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but he told us to tell you...",spongebob,1
Tell me what?,not spongebob,0
He told me to tell you... April Fools.,spongebob,1
"Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!",spongebob,1
"Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!",spongebob,1
You do?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well, as long as it's not me.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?",not spongebob,0
"They're riiiight here, lady!",spongebob,1
"But, this is a spoon...",not spongebob,0
APRIL FOOLS!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's that?",spongebob,1
"Well, I didn't see anything...  hey, where'd that other guy go?",not spongebob,0
April Fools!! I'm right here!!,spongebob,1
"Hey, that was pretty good.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing behind the counter?,not spongebob,0

I guess that is pretty funny!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  APRIL FOOOOOLS!",spongebob,1

...Ohhh!&#160;:(,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?",not spongebob,0
"Aww, man, poor kid.",not spongebob,0
That guy has definitely got some issues to work out.,not spongebob,0
April Fools... jerk.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, don't go!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you stink!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.  SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... What?  Patrick? What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
Digging.,not spongebob,0
Why are you wearing that hat?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
Where's SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
He's in the house. He's impressed.,not spongebob,0

"SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!",not spongebob,0
What do you want?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.",not spongebob,0

"I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?",not spongebob,0
I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.,spongebob,1
"Doh!  SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.",not spongebob,0
But I couldn't...,spongebob,1
I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!,not spongebob,0
It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.,not spongebob,0
"April Fools, jerk.",not spongebob,0
YOU STINK!,not spongebob,0
"Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Is all that true?,spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.",not spongebob,0

I promise.,spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
April Fools!,not spongebob,0

Hey!  What? You can't do that! It's not fair!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please! Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formuler.",not spongebob,0

"Hello, yes. I have a complaint.",not spongebob,0
That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest.,not spongebob,0
I am Agent Twirp of the Bogus  Business Bureau.  Are you the proprietor of this...  establishment?,not spongebob,0
"Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.",not spongebob,0
"Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs.  He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
New trainee.,not spongebob,0
"According to article 57 of the Greasy Spoon Code, all fast food contests must be open to all customers, no matter how diminutive or annoying.",not spongebob,0
"And I'm both of those things! You have to let me guess now,  Krabs!",not spongebob,0
I'm won't do it!  And you can't make me.,not spongebob,0
"If you refuse, I'll  shut down the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, fine!",not spongebob,0
This round goes to Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?",spongebob,1
No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.,not spongebob,0
Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's getting close.",not spongebob,0
...And one!,not spongebob,0
Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none! You are one over the mark. You lose.,not spongebob,0
Hold on! It's not official unless you count them.,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
A lot of boring math later...,not spongebob,0
"500298, 500299, 500300.  I win!",not spongebob,0
Eh!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs! Plankton was-- right.",spongebob,1
YES!,not spongebob,0
I now command you to give Mr. Plankton his prize.,not spongebob,0
"You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
I can't.,not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.,not spongebob,0
I cleaned it this morning.,spongebob,1
Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?,not spongebob,0
"Nope, she's perfectly aligned.",spongebob,1
"Drat your efficiency! Uh, oh, yeah!  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show!",not spongebob,0
What show?,not spongebob,0
The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty.  See?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?",not spongebob,0
"It clearly says, and a show. I'll allow it.",not spongebob,0
Drat!,not spongebob,0
Is this part of  the show?,not spongebob,0
"No, this is isn't part of the show.",not spongebob,0
"Mm, such lovely filigree, wouldn't you agree?",not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
Puppets!,spongebob,1
"Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.",not spongebob,0
La la la la la la la la!,not spongebob,0
"He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  Pla-- Flankton!",not spongebob,0
Boo! Hiss!,spongebob,1
"So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, My face! Ahhhhhhhh, My face!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, we get it already!",not spongebob,0
"Unfortunately for Flankton,  the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventurally he popped!  The end.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?",not spongebob,0
"Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.",not spongebob,0
"I'll do my best, sir.",spongebob,1
Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, to the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. It's a death trap.",not spongebob,0
"There we go.  Ooh, that takes care of that.  And in three, two, one.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it's awful! We're all out of buns!",spongebob,1
No buns? Drat the luck!,not spongebob,0
Got a delivery for the Krusty Krab. Where do you want us to put these buns?,not spongebob,0
"Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd.",spongebob,1
"Finally! At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine! Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.",not spongebob,0
One Krabby Patty to go.   Here you are.,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you don't!  You have to eat it on the premises.  Them's the rules.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that's what it says.",not spongebob,0
So?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay. I will!  I bid you good day, sir.",not spongebob,0
You gotta swallow it here on the premises.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on.",not spongebob,0
I'll allow it.,not spongebob,0
Fine!  Can I go now?,not spongebob,0
"Karen, quick! You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat!",not spongebob,0
But what about anesthetic?,not spongebob,0
There's no time! I can feel it digesting!,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you say, dear. Hold still.  This may pinch a little.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"What is it, lad?",not spongebob,0
Take a look.,spongebob,1
"Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene! You want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket!",not spongebob,0
I feel terrible! The Krabby Patty takes like stomach acid!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and it tastes like aspirin and carrots!  Ugh! Get it off! Get it off!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, come back! Oh, come on, Karen, what happened?",not spongebob,0
I just did what you asked.  I analyzed the contents of your stomach and used them to synthesize a  Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"It warms me heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over.  Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah,  and put these seeds back on 'em.",not spongebob,0
That's my Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.",not spongebob,0
Hmm... ah!,not spongebob,0
"My pencil!  What? No, no!",not spongebob,0
The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.,not spongebob,0
Noooooo!,not spongebob,0
"Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...",spongebob,1
Two...,not spongebob,0
Three!,not spongebob,0
"Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One...",spongebob,1
two...,not spongebob,0
"Three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper?",spongebob,1
"What is that thing, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
It looks like a giant pencil!,spongebob,1
Go touch it!,not spongebob,0
"It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it.",spongebob,1
Whatcha drawin'?,not spongebob,0
"Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck.",spongebob,1
"Psshh, artists.",not spongebob,0
It's a jellyfish.,spongebob,1
"Pretty good, SpongeBob, but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, everybody's a critic.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!",not spongebob,0
"Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic.",spongebob,1
"No, I mean it's swimming away!",not spongebob,0
"Do you know what this means, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Your art can never hang in a museum.,not spongebob,0
It means we found a magic pencil!,spongebob,1
Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.,not spongebob,0
Coming right up!,spongebob,1
"Life is good!  Easy come, easy go...",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. You've got looks, talent, all you need is a full head of...  HAIR!",not spongebob,0
My turn!,not spongebob,0
"Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.",spongebob,1
Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.,not spongebob,0
Okay! Why didn't you say so?,spongebob,1
Hey! Another jellyfish!,spongebob,1
"It's Squidward, silly!",not spongebob,0
It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.,spongebob,1
"You're right, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
We can't let it go into town!,spongebob,1
Poor Squidward.,not spongebob,0
Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!,spongebob,1
I think I fancy a stroll around the park.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me!  Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!",spongebob,1
He's going to the door.,not spongebob,0
He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...,spongebob,1
"OOH! OWW, OWW, OW!",not spongebob,0
He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!,not spongebob,0
"DoodleBoy, stop!",spongebob,1
He's got the pencil.,not spongebob,0
What have I done? We've got to find him!,spongebob,1
Where could he possibly be?,spongebob,1
Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, let's go!",spongebob,1
I'm not going in there,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there...",spongebob,1
What just happened?,not spongebob,0
"Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!",spongebob,1
Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?,not spongebob,0
No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.,spongebob,1
Neofineyin!,not spongebob,0
"See what I mean, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"WHERE'S THE LEAK, MA'AM?  Yurrgh!",not spongebob,0
"You okay, Patrick?",spongebob,1
FINLAND!,not spongebob,0
Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay!,not spongebob,0
There he is.,spongebob,1
"He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!",not spongebob,0
Uh... *ahem*.,spongebob,1
"Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob. Heh heh!",not spongebob,0
"He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?",not spongebob,0
Bawahh bwah bwah wahh!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!,spongebob,1
Happy Birthday!,not spongebob,0
Here's your present.  You're welcome.,not spongebob,0
Dewaaagheaugaaagh!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?",spongebob,1
EEDAHFAAWAHOBABOBBA!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, what was that?",spongebob,1
Ee...DAh...Faawa...HobaBobba...,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...!  I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!",spongebob,1
Take it easy. It's just a drawing.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Done and done.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.",spongebob,1
Meeeoowww.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, magic pencil.  Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!",spongebob,1
You Doodle! Me SpongeBob!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school.",spongebob,1
"Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!",not spongebob,0
Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?",not spongebob,0
"Take a look for yourself, Patrick.",spongebob,1
It's the evil Doodle!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose.",spongebob,1
So... he's a drawing?,not spongebob,0
Exactly! See how happy he is?,spongebob,1
He still looks kind of creepy.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Ready!,not spongebob,0
We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.,not spongebob,0
Huh? What's this?  My pencil!,not spongebob,0
The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.,not spongebob,0
NOOOOO!!!,not spongebob,0
What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?,not spongebob,0
"You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples!",not spongebob,0
"New and original, my exhaust fan.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!",not spongebob,0
You mean the smell?   Smell.,not spongebob,0
"No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what did he just say it was?",not spongebob,0
I just said they're free!,not spongebob,0
Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case...  So glad I actually left my house today.,not spongebob,0
"That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.",not spongebob,0
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!",not spongebob,0
Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and...  get him.",not spongebob,0
Free samples.  Yum!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you!, I know you're in there!",not spongebob,0
It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!,not spongebob,0
"If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!",not spongebob,0
Free Krabby Patties?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's all the hubble?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
That's it.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay.",not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties, anyone?",not spongebob,0
"I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.",spongebob,1
You!,not spongebob,0
You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
Over here boy.,not spongebob,0
What is going on out there?,spongebob,1
The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  Because the Krabby Patty is terrible.  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?",spongebob,1
Fine.  How about that?  I'm ruined!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.",spongebob,1
I'm all ears.,not spongebob,0
We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr-,spongebob,1
"Don't you say it, boy!",not spongebob,0
"It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time.",spongebob,1
Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free.,not spongebob,0
But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.,spongebob,1
I don't remember saying anything like that.,not spongebob,0
I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
"It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties!",spongebob,1
"Whew, uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed!",not spongebob,0
I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.",spongebob,1
"Hey look, Billy, a calliope.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.",spongebob,1
I can't feel my legs.,not spongebob,0
"Here let me help you, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Look, mama, a monkey!  Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!",not spongebob,0
I quit!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!",spongebob,1
"Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.",spongebob,1
"Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.",not spongebob,0
New... Different...  That's it!,spongebob,1
"Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room.",not spongebob,0
Five minutes later.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!",spongebob,1
You can't be serious.,not spongebob,0
"I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.",not spongebob,0
No! Wait!,not spongebob,0
"Let him go, it's too late.",not spongebob,0
All new free Krabby Patties!,spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose.  Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay!",not spongebob,0
Did he just say it was good?,not spongebob,0
Woohoo!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!",not spongebob,0
I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy?,not spongebob,0
"Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yum!  Hey, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more!",not spongebob,0
Now that's what I'm talking about!,not spongebob,0
Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Karen, I'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?!",not spongebob,0
It's working!,spongebob,1
"No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
"We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!",spongebob,1
"Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, money angels, can I make one?",spongebob,1
"Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?",not spongebob,0
Hear what?,spongebob,1
Good point.,not spongebob,0
"We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.. flipping burgers?!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, kids! Potty and I took jobs flipping burgers so we could be just like our hero...SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
I took the job for the free sodas.,not spongebob,0
"Potty, don't you have dishes to wash?",not spongebob,0
Argh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.",not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"One order of Scurvy Fries, one large Bilge Water.",not spongebob,0
Argh! Arrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Diet Bilge Water. I'll get right on it sir.  Ahhhhh!",not spongebob,0
P.U.! What died in there?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new Pirate Patties! I call this one Buried Treasure.",not spongebob,0
Where'd you dig that one up?,not spongebob,0
I call this one Walk the Plank.,not spongebob,0
I'm already board with that one.,not spongebob,0
This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The Patchy Patty!,not spongebob,0
Ahoy!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, that's the worst one yet.",not spongebob,0
"Potty Parrot, you are never supportive of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, Patchy, no!  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Squawk!",not spongebob,0
"You know, this isn't the first time that a patty's come between two good chums. It happened once in Bikini Bottom. Here, take a look while I......pull myself together.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, something ain't right.",not spongebob,0
For me?,not spongebob,0
Don't you find this a tad suspicious?,not spongebob,0
Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing.,not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
Duck!,spongebob,1
Disengage!,not spongebob,0
Me secret formula!,not spongebob,0
"Happy Birthday, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Don't forget your condiments, Plankton.",spongebob,1
"Attaboy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Safe!,spongebob,1
"You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles.",not spongebob,0
"Why, Mr. Krabs? Why does he hate us so?!",spongebob,1
"Well, you might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I...were...best friends.",not spongebob,0
Best friends?,spongebob,1
"Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones...",not spongebob,0
Goo.,not spongebob,0
Aw!,not spongebob,0
...things were all peaches and cream... ...until we hit grade school.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Planky. What'cha doing?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out.  Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away.",not spongebob,0
"How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000?",not spongebob,0
"They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!",not spongebob,0
"Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry.  Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping, the trash can?",not spongebob,0
"'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ....fashion me clothes from rags.",not spongebob,0
"There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.",not spongebob,0
Oops.  I missed a spot.,not spongebob,0
"Then one day, as Plankton and I plotted our revenge, I met the love of me life.",not spongebob,0
What in Neptune's name is that?  It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!,not spongebob,0
It's money.,not spongebob,0
Moneyyyyyyyyyy?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. You can buy things with it.,not spongebob,0
Buy things?,not spongebob,0
"So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea what that went through to get here.",spongebob,1
"I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?",spongebob,1
Yeah. I really wanna know.,not spongebob,0
"Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called Stinky Burgers. It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky.  And Stinky loved the kids.",not spongebob,0
"Now, what can I do for you, young 'uns?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one burger, please!",not spongebob,0
"Me, too, Stinky!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone.",not spongebob,0
"That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.",not spongebob,0
"We don't like Stinky, we respect him.",not spongebob,0
"Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like or respect me?",not spongebob,0
Like!,not spongebob,0
Respect!,not spongebob,0
Like!,not spongebob,0
Respect!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me.",not spongebob,0
Excuse us!,not spongebob,0
Valuable customers coming through.,not spongebob,0
What are those dorks doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Two Stinky Burgers, please.",not spongebob,0
"Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Stinky!",not spongebob,0
Thanks for keeping the nerds out.,not spongebob,0
"You're the best, Stinky.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy.  Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li...  Is it quitting time already?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials.",not spongebob,0
"Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipping burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.",not spongebob,0
"Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if someone made a better burger, they'd have a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?",not spongebob,0
"Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!",not spongebob,0
I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met.  If I could only hear his voice.,not spongebob,0
Less talking and more working.,not spongebob,0
Potty! You came back to apologize!,not spongebob,0
I came to tell you to get back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, a little thing called the G.E.D., my man.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, here we go again with the fancy book-learnin'. Customers love me cookin'. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?",not spongebob,0
"You just need some practice, that's all.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, me patty's done.",not spongebob,0
Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, fine. I'll eat it!  Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!  Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, roll film.  A perfect patty on the first try.",not spongebob,0
"Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!",not spongebob,0
"You're unsanitary, Patchy. You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's what gives it its special flavor.",not spongebob,0
You've got rats in the kitchen!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess?  Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!",not spongebob,0
And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.,not spongebob,0
What? Every time?,not spongebob,0
That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.,not spongebob,0
What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?,not spongebob,0
The same kind who wears a Kiss the Cook apron.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh?",not spongebob,0
Now I feel sick.,not spongebob,0
"That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?",not spongebob,0
Now you've done it.,not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Pirateson.  You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.",not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.",not spongebob,0
"So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress.",not spongebob,0
Gently. Gently.,not spongebob,0
"We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kids' greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please.",not spongebob,0
"There you are, sir.",not spongebob,0
"'Twas me first dollar I ever earned, and 'twas also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.",not spongebob,0
"Hey! Your burgers are even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.",not spongebob,0
"Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.",not spongebob,0
I thought it was our recipe.,not spongebob,0
I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds!,not spongebob,0
But what about satisfying the customer?,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!",not spongebob,0
Give me that!,not spongebob,0
Stop! You're gonna bust it!,not spongebob,0
Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!,not spongebob,0
"I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?",not spongebob,0
Which one? The one that says Eject or the one that says Trap Door?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, either one will do.",not spongebob,0
What I was saying was...  YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!!  And he always did.,not spongebob,0
Lies!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.",not spongebob,0
"Very touching, but completely false.",not spongebob,0
Don't know what you mean.,not spongebob,0
Why don't you tell them the truth?,not spongebob,0
"It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory.",not spongebob,0
"First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money!",not spongebob,0
But what about satisfying the customers?,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!",not spongebob,0
Gimme that!,not spongebob,0
"Stop, you're gonna bust it.",not spongebob,0
"This isn't about money, Eugene.",not spongebob,0
Malarkey.,not spongebob,0
YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!!  Ouch.   Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.",spongebob,1
That's because it isn't.,not spongebob,0
KAREN?!,not spongebob,0
"You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.",not spongebob,0
It was only our third date.,not spongebob,0
"Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks.",not spongebob,0
Now that's a handsome looking burger.,not spongebob,0
"You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?",not spongebob,0
What's that music?,not spongebob,0
I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins!,not spongebob,0
I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.,not spongebob,0
You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.,not spongebob,0
"Why, I'd be happy to!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Plab Patties KO Old Man J. I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.,not spongebob,0
"Well, he is old.",not spongebob,0
Hey. That guy is like family to me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.",not spongebob,0
You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger. (The Subtitles in Netflix reads You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in.),not spongebob,0
You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.,not spongebob,0
"No way, that recipe's mine!",not spongebob,0
"Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.",not spongebob,0
"Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.",not spongebob,0
"I think not, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
What?! Why I oughta squash you right now! You little...,not spongebob,0
Get out of my face!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look! Nerd fight.",not spongebob,0
I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.,not spongebob,0
"Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.",not spongebob,0
Big Johnny will eat anything.,not spongebob,0
"Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir.",not spongebob,0
Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.,not spongebob,0
"Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think!",not spongebob,0
I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.,not spongebob,0
"Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Flavor!,not spongebob,0
Edible!,not spongebob,0
We can actually hold it down!,not spongebob,0
This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!,not spongebob,0
"Yay, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
"I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do!",not spongebob,0
"Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!",not spongebob,0
You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!,not spongebob,0
You callin' me a liar?,not spongebob,0
Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship!,not spongebob,0
You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.,not spongebob,0
My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.,not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
"It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?",not spongebob,0
"I'd like that, Planky, old chum.",not spongebob,0
"Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?",spongebob,1
I suppose it would. If I had one.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Me, too. Me, too.",not spongebob,0
"Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
Sabotage!,spongebob,1
"Go, Karen!",not spongebob,0
"Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you got fired, too!",not spongebob,0
I got a golden parachute.,not spongebob,0
"Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.",not spongebob,0
Looks like they already did.,not spongebob,0
"What!? They let a smelly, hairy fleabag like that serve food?",not spongebob,0
Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, watch it, ape!",not spongebob,0
Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!,not spongebob,0
Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!",not spongebob,0
"And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed.",not spongebob,0
"Bikini Bottom Action News! Tonight's  top story: A wealthy entrepreneur, who wishes to remain  anonymous, is  sponsoring this year's  sleigh race. First prize:  one million dollars!  All of Bikini Bottom is entered, but only one hopeful will win. We join roving reporter  Perch Perkins live at the scene.",not spongebob,0
The tension's building up as the  contestants line up to win the prize.,not spongebob,0
"Gary and I are gonna  try to win the prize so Mr. Krabs can fix up the Krusty Krab.  Right, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want!  Good thing I brought out the heavy artillery  Gooey Worms!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick those don't move.",spongebob,1
Sure they do! Giddy up!  Hyah!  See?,not spongebob,0
"You don't stand a chance, Krabs! Karen and I--I mean, my worm and I are gonna whip your tail fin!  Right, worm?",not spongebob,0
Ruff ruff.,not spongebob,0
"And with the prize money, I'll topple your restaurant empire  once and for all!",not spongebob,0
"Ha! Where fetchin' money's involved, nobody topples me.",not spongebob,0
"Contestants, ready your sleds.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir.  How do you think you'll do in the race?",not spongebob,0
Hello out there Bikini Bottom!  I'm glad I can finally talk to my adoring fans on television!,not spongebob,0
"Best of luck to ya.  Oh, excuse me miss...",not spongebob,0
On your marks...,not spongebob,0
So long suckers.,not spongebob,0
"... get set,  go!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, wormies! Giddy up!  Hmm.",not spongebob,0
"Meanwhile, back in the lowlands...",not spongebob,0
"Alone at last!  Now, there's nothing between me and the secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"C'mon, boys! Get me to the greenbacks!",not spongebob,0
"I think not old man. Turbo boost, Karen!",not spongebob,0
No!  I can't let him win.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, he won't.  I will.  Yeehaw!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Hi Patrick. Where's your sleigh?,spongebob,1
I dunno.,not spongebob,0
Hop in. We'll give you a lift.  Come on Gary!,spongebob,1
Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.  Good thing I brought this along.  I'm gonna need something with more firepower.,not spongebob,0
Woo wee! Looks like I lost them!  The remote shorted out! The robots are stuck in high gear! Whoa!  Aaaa!,not spongebob,0
Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!,not spongebob,0
"(speaks in a British Accent) I beg your pardon. It's tea time, anyway.",not spongebob,0
I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts!' ',not spongebob,0
Whoa! Look at that!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Buddy!  He doesn't look so hot. We better take him with us.,spongebob,1
Good idea.,not spongebob,0
Meoow...,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, do you hear that?",spongebob,1
Sandy?,not spongebob,0
"Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.",not spongebob,0
"No problem, right, Gare?",spongebob,1
Meow...  Errrgg!,not spongebob,0
"Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest!",not spongebob,0
Heeelp!,not spongebob,0
Hi Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms!,not spongebob,0
"Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!",spongebob,1
"Much appreciate it, boy!",not spongebob,0
Faster! Faster! Faster!,not spongebob,0
Mooowww...,not spongebob,0
Faster! Faster!,not spongebob,0
Faster!,not spongebob,0
This is a dead end!,spongebob,1
Rooooooooarr!  Meow.,not spongebob,0
Great. Now we're trapped.,not spongebob,0
"Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...",not spongebob,0
It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!,not spongebob,0
Hey! How about a campfire song?,spongebob,1
No Singing!,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket.",not spongebob,0
"Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?",not spongebob,0
Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh!,not spongebob,0
Not you again!,not spongebob,0
Ha! Slimey snow vermin! You missed!,not spongebob,0
That's weren't the attack.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hit the deck!,not spongebob,0
Gary!,spongebob,1
Oh no... not again...,not spongebob,0
She's reloading! Now's our chance to scram.,not spongebob,0
What is that formidable creature?,spongebob,1
"That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.",not spongebob,0
I thought that was just a myth.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I assure you, she's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Twas back when I was young sea captain,  sailing in the Atlantic sea. When the behemith and i first tangled.",not spongebob,0
"Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!",spongebob,1
"Nope, that didn't work.  She gulped me and me crew down in one swift swallow.",not spongebob,0
"Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale.",spongebob,1
"Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course.",not spongebob,0
Hm? Oh! Ew.,spongebob,1
"I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today!",not spongebob,0
"Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!",spongebob,1
"Oh, be gentle, it's my last one!",not spongebob,0
Hold on tight!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here!,not spongebob,0
"Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh?  Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to weigh us down and make with the prize himself!",not spongebob,0
Argh argh argh! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish than share me winnings with y--,not spongebob,0
"We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"What's the big emergency, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
I saw something shiny.,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Well, let's just drop everything, then!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait, Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.",spongebob,1
Karen?,spongebob,1
I say she's in swift need of a reboot! Heee ya!,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Plankton?  Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.",spongebob,1
Well we gotta bust him out but quick! I'm gonna sit on him!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile.",spongebob,1
A simulacrum!,not spongebob,0
Sandy please! Language!,spongebob,1
"Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!",not spongebob,0
"That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact,  this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton.  With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected.",not spongebob,0
Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!,spongebob,1
And exactly how do you propose we find him?,not spongebob,0
"I saw Mr. Krabs pass by  just before my system failed, heading southwest.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!",spongebob,1
"Hehehehe!  Yeuch!  So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive!  Ahem! I meant destructive!",not spongebob,0
"Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...",not spongebob,0
"Attaboy, Gary!",spongebob,1
Ahhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, whew.",not spongebob,0
Cliff!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--...land?",spongebob,1
Fire in the hole!  Rats.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab!",not spongebob,0
I can't feel my looking holes!,not spongebob,0
The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach.,spongebob,1
"You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions.  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?",not spongebob,0
"I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary!",not spongebob,0
"Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch.",spongebob,1
"Great, now we're stuck.",not spongebob,0
"No, we're not!  Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.",spongebob,1
We must be heading in the right direction!,not spongebob,0
"Secret formula, you are mine!",not spongebob,0
"Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit!  Molecule by molecule!  Atom by atom!!  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
"Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, i'm trying to sleep.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? He froze up too.",not spongebob,0
Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?,not spongebob,0
And are you aware I just saved your life?,not spongebob,0
"The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings.",not spongebob,0
"Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!",not spongebob,0
Duped? You don't mean by...,not spongebob,0
Now you're putting it together!,not spongebob,0
My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!,not spongebob,0
We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.,not spongebob,0
We're doomed.,not spongebob,0
No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!,spongebob,1
"No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.",not spongebob,0
Just leave that to the scientist of the group!,not spongebob,0
Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?,not spongebob,0
Hahahaha!,not spongebob,0
She's all fired up!,not spongebob,0
"Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?",spongebob,1
Lookin' clear so far.,not spongebob,0
Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!,spongebob,1
One frozen wasteland later.,not spongebob,0
Hooray! We made it.,spongebob,1
Okay... then where's my restaurant?,not spongebob,0
Perhaps over there..,spongebob,1
And where's my formula?,not spongebob,0
Perhaps over there.,not spongebob,0
"The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?!",not spongebob,0
We're too late!,spongebob,1
We'll see about that boy-o!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!",not spongebob,0
This will only take a minute.,not spongebob,0
Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open.,not spongebob,0
Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!,not spongebob,0
Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?,not spongebob,0
I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's easy!",not spongebob,0
Patrick!,not spongebob,0
"Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy.",not spongebob,0
"That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.",not spongebob,0
"#160;: Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!",not spongebob,0
You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!,not spongebob,0
"Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon!",not spongebob,0
"Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Then hand over my formula.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools?",not spongebob,0
"You get back here, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
Here we go again...,not spongebob,0
Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!,not spongebob,0
"I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close.  So long, suckers!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hehehe!,not spongebob,0
We're trapped!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.",not spongebob,0
He's going to turn us into fried snacks!,not spongebob,0
Got any dipping sauce?,not spongebob,0
A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?,not spongebob,0
Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
Nom nom?,spongebob,1
Nom nom!  Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
"W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!",spongebob,1
"No, eat me!",not spongebob,0
"Don't eat me, eat Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, what?!",not spongebob,0
Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
"She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!",spongebob,1
I better go while the going's good.,not spongebob,0
Jellybean!,not spongebob,0
I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?",spongebob,1
He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties.  Huh?! What's this?",not spongebob,0
"Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Down there, sir!",not spongebob,0
There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress!  There can only be one culprit: Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win!",not spongebob,0
"He got away, sir.",not spongebob,0
No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!,not spongebob,0
"Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's...  ...SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
"A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!",spongebob,1
Yeehaw!,not spongebob,0
"Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.",spongebob,1
Argh! I can't take it!,not spongebob,0
Plankton! It's you!,spongebob,1
"Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.",spongebob,1
Wh-what did you say?,not spongebob,0
"I said, you're a--",spongebob,1
Loser!,not spongebob,0
"How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day.",not spongebob,0
"♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪",not spongebob,0
"I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.",spongebob,1
Which no... whatever.,not spongebob,0
A customer?  Our special today is chum...  ...balaya.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Plankton.",spongebob,1
Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?,not spongebob,0
No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Play with me.,spongebob,1
You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?,not spongebob,0
"No, but I like to go jelly...",spongebob,1
That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?,not spongebob,0
"You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!",not spongebob,0
Elaborate.,not spongebob,0
"Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!",not spongebob,0
Take the Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.",not spongebob,0
...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.,spongebob,1
"Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.",not spongebob,0
"Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net.",spongebob,1
What happens after we eat 'em?,not spongebob,0
"You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that.",spongebob,1
And?,not spongebob,0
And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!,spongebob,1
"Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!",not spongebob,0
"It's not about winning, it's about fun!",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...,spongebob,1
"What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪",spongebob,1
♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪,not spongebob,0
"♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪",not spongebob,0
"Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪",spongebob,1
Never! That's completely idiotic!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!",spongebob,1
"♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪",not spongebob,0
♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪,not spongebob,0
"Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?",not spongebob,0
No! That's how you're suppose to feel!,spongebob,1
"Well, I like it. Let's do it again!",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪",not spongebob,0
"Arrgh, mutiny.",not spongebob,0
"And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...",not spongebob,0
Sounds like fun.,not spongebob,0
"Well, the really fun part was when we...",not spongebob,0
What did you do with the Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
The what?,not spongebob,0
"The Krabby Patty, remember?",not spongebob,0
"You can't rush these things, you know.",not spongebob,0
You're forgetting about the mission!,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
"You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself!",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.,not spongebob,0
Who knows? Maybe he's changed.,spongebob,1
Who knows? I think you knows!,not spongebob,0
"He's changed, I tell you!",spongebob,1
SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you?",not spongebob,0
"What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...",not spongebob,0
Why can't you just accept our friendship?,spongebob,1
"He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.",not spongebob,0
Uhh... suit yourself.,not spongebob,0
"We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here.",spongebob,1
"Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin!",not spongebob,0
"I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey, Bubble Bass!",spongebob,1
"Thanks for that, friend.",not spongebob,0
Sure thing.,spongebob,1
Listen up!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy!",not spongebob,0
I can't believe this!,spongebob,1
It's not what you think.,not spongebob,0
What is it then? Tell me what you see here!,spongebob,1
I... I don't see anything.,not spongebob,0
How can you not see it!?,spongebob,1
"Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it.",not spongebob,0
But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?,spongebob,1
How long what?,not spongebob,0
How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!,spongebob,1
What?!,spongebob,1
"All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.",spongebob,1
"Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.",spongebob,1
"Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Well, maybe on a discount.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Gary! What are you doing!?,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow, meow...",not spongebob,0
"What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!",not spongebob,0
"Is something wrong, Patrick?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What is that?,not spongebob,0
What's what?,spongebob,1
This!,not spongebob,0
"P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?",spongebob,1
Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!,not spongebob,0
Good idea!,spongebob,1
"Uhh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
I don't know about this!,not spongebob,0
What makes you say that?,spongebob,1
This.,not spongebob,0
"Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Sure do! Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  Itch!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind!  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?,not spongebob,0
All what-y?,spongebob,1
"Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all!",spongebob,1
That's no blemish!,not spongebob,0
Help… Me!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll help you, alright!",not spongebob,0
S.W.A.T. Team.  We'll be right over!,not spongebob,0
Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet.,not spongebob,0
"Stop, you fool!  Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.",not spongebob,0
"Get back! I said, get back! Back I say!",not spongebob,0
"What's going on, Squidward? Help!",spongebob,1
"Here's your change, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, why thank you very much, young man.",not spongebob,0
"What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick.",not spongebob,0
Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home!,spongebob,1
"You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.",not spongebob,0
"Where's my snail, Gary?",spongebob,1
We've taken care of your pet.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Gary? Whoa!,spongebob,1
"He appears stable, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, boys, let's pack it up.",not spongebob,0
Wow!  Huh? What is this?,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!,spongebob,1
Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!",spongebob,1
"Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?",not spongebob,0
Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?,spongebob,1
I win! I win! I win!,not spongebob,0
Patrick?,spongebob,1
"Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.,spongebob,1
I've got an idea!,not spongebob,0
"There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh? Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work!",spongebob,1
Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",not spongebob,0
Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…,not spongebob,0
"If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids.",not spongebob,0
Ahh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!",not spongebob,0
What's all the commotion about?,not spongebob,0
"The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.",not spongebob,0
"Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.",spongebob,1
"Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?",not spongebob,0
We are!,not spongebob,0
It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!,not spongebob,0
No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!,not spongebob,0
Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!  NOOOOO!,spongebob,1
"Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"It's not me, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?,spongebob,1
"He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Me next!,not spongebob,0
Where are your manners? It's ladies first!,not spongebob,0
I believe the expression is starfish first.,not spongebob,0
I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!",not spongebob,0
Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive.  I'll take two, please.",not spongebob,0
Alright!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!",spongebob,1
"Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"What do you want, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar.",spongebob,1
More like another nickel.,not spongebob,0
"Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel.",spongebob,1
It's not that funny.,not spongebob,0
"It's funny, because it's true!",spongebob,1
Move over.,not spongebob,0
Nickel.,spongebob,1
Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
And always check for spare change.,not spongebob,0
"Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Another day, another nickel.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!",not spongebob,0
I don't?,spongebob,1
No. You should sit down.,not spongebob,0
But...,spongebob,1
"Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I am?,spongebob,1
"Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, a little.",spongebob,1
And your temperature is 175 degrees!,not spongebob,0
It's that bad?,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.",not spongebob,0
"I have been laughing a lot, lately.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're going to burn out your laugh box.",not spongebob,0
My laugh box?,spongebob,1
"Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.",not spongebob,0
"Is that what happened to you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, you want to hear a joke?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"Sure, I'd love a good laugh.",spongebob,1
What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck!,not spongebob,0
"I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.",not spongebob,0
How long do I have to avoid laughing?,spongebob,1
"Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, banana peel, don't!",spongebob,1
What'd you say?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what the...",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!",spongebob,1
Right foot first...,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.",spongebob,1
"You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out.",not spongebob,0
"Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!",spongebob,1
Look out for that pie truck!,not spongebob,0
"I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!",spongebob,1
What happened?,not spongebob,0
I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.,spongebob,1
"Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match.",not spongebob,0
Come in.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"What's wrong, boy?",not spongebob,0
I lost my laugh.,spongebob,1
"You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?",not spongebob,0
Not really.,spongebob,1
This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.,not spongebob,0
Nothing.,spongebob,1
"Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.",not spongebob,0
Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist.,spongebob,1
"Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?",not spongebob,0
"The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.",spongebob,1
"But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.",not spongebob,0
Sounds painful.,spongebob,1
"Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.",not spongebob,0
I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again.,spongebob,1
I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy.,not spongebob,0
Later that same evening...,not spongebob,0
"I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.",not spongebob,0
"But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!",not spongebob,0
You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.,spongebob,1
"(taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.",not spongebob,0
I could laugh the whole time?,spongebob,1
Yeah.  You really fell for it.,not spongebob,0
I guess I did.,spongebob,1
You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine.,not spongebob,0
"It's really not that funny, Squidward.",spongebob,1
It's hilarious!,not spongebob,0
"See ya later, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel.  yahhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Look, he's waking up.",not spongebob,0
(groans) Where am I?,not spongebob,0
"You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.",not spongebob,0
"The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.",not spongebob,0
So they cut it out.,not spongebob,0
Cut it out?!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.",not spongebob,0
Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?,not spongebob,0
Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.,not spongebob,0
"But, you cut out my laugh box.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.",not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
They wouldn't pay me.,not spongebob,0
You're getting warmer.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world.",spongebob,1
Batter up!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, oh.",spongebob,1
"I got it, I got it!",not spongebob,0
Wah!,spongebob,1
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!,not spongebob,0
"Just treasuring our time together, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!",not spongebob,0
I can't do it! I can't be away from my best friend!,not spongebob,0
"No, it hurts too much!",spongebob,1
"Oh, will you two cut it out?",not spongebob,0
"Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!",spongebob,1
It is?,not spongebob,0
Wow! My turn!,not spongebob,0
I think I'm gonna be sick!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Patrick. Now we never have to be apart,  even when we're not together.",spongebob,1
"This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, see you forever, Patrick.  Time for bed, Tiny Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Uh.  Oh.,not spongebob,0
Ah.  Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Says who?,not spongebob,0
"You sit right there, my hungry little sailor, while I whip you up some grub from the galley.",spongebob,1
"Dah, uh-huh.",not spongebob,0
Ah.,not spongebob,0
Ahh. Hmm?  Ahhh! Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot.",spongebob,1
Ohhh.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
Whee-ah!,not spongebob,0
"Stop!  Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm.  Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done.  Ah-yah.",spongebob,1
0 and Patrick bangs on it to stop. Patrick and Mini SpongeBob stretch and yawn.],not spongebob,0
Good morning.,not spongebob,0
Didn't think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did!,not spongebob,0
"Brushy, brushy, brushy.",spongebob,1
"Come on, Tiny SpongeBob. You gotta lift with your back.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh. Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, hi.",spongebob,1
Eeh.  Hmm. Hmm.,not spongebob,0
"So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, well, me and Tiny SpongeBob,  we're pretty busy tonight, so good night.",not spongebob,0
Good night.,spongebob,1
"I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam.",spongebob,1
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Hey. Didn't you used to have one two...two arms? Okay, little buddy. Let's find that arm of yours. Oh.  Oh.  Nope.  Nope. Hmm.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Ah!,not spongebob,0
Nope.  Oh. Ah-ha! I got it!  I'll fix you up in no time.  Good as new.,not spongebob,0
Ehh. Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, good night.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Oh?,not spongebob,0
Ding!  Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward, extra mayo, I heard you.",spongebob,1
"Oh, hi, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I don't remember us having a sleepover last night.,spongebob,1
"What's going on, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, little guys. You're playing with each other. So cute.",spongebob,1
Whew.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, ah.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"What are they doing, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives.",spongebob,1
Poor little guys.,spongebob,1
"Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.",not spongebob,0
"You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Ta-da! A tiny house for my tiny friend.,spongebob,1
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it!",not spongebob,0
"Nice work, Patrick. Whoops!  Almost forgot.  You've got to have a Gare-Bear.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yay!",not spongebob,0
Ohh.  Huh?,not spongebob,0
Aww.  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Let's leave 'em alone, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Ah, too bright.  Oh, those two again!",not spongebob,0
What the—,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"No, get away. Get away!",not spongebob,0
"Howdy, neighbor. It's your old pal, Sandy Cheeks with a true to life tale direct from Bikini Bottom. It's the end of another long day, and every critter in town is getting ready to hit the hay.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
Even little old SpongeBob and Gary are laying down their weary heads.,not spongebob,0
Night Gare-bear.,spongebob,1
"Now snails love to sleep, but they also like to have their fun. And clever little Gary here is no different.  With a dang nifty decoy in place, Gary is ready to hit the town.",not spongebob,0
"But first things first. That gooey little varmint is mighty hungry.  It may not look like much to you and me, but this here is four-star dining to a snail.",not spongebob,0
"Now, Gary never minds running into a friend, but old Patrick here don't seem ready to share his meal.",not spongebob,0
"Ol' Gary feels as big as a ten-point buck right now, but he's about to be reminded that life ain't all fun and games. Especially when animal control is on your tail.",not spongebob,0
"Freeze, slime ball!",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"As much as Gary likes getting one over on the heat, he has more important matters to attend to.",not spongebob,0
"This here is old Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket. Gary ain't here for vittles, though. No one's ever at the Chum Bucket for vittles.",not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
That there's Spot. Plankton's pet amoeba and Gary's best friend.,not spongebob,0
Psst.,not spongebob,0
"Spot's cute, but about as dumb as a barrel of hair.  Gary better think quick or they'll both be busted before their night's even begun.",not spongebob,0
Ough!,not spongebob,0
"Ol' Gary and Spot have been sneaking out for ages though their owners are none the wiser.  They love playing all sorts of games together, but their doggone favorite is wrestling.",not spongebob,0
It's the Krusty Krab kitchen. What a stroke of luck.,not spongebob,0
Gary and Spot must have worked up quite an appetite with all them fun and games.,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. That ice box is locked up tighter than a horse thief in a hoosegow.,not spongebob,0
Oh boy. It's chow time.,not spongebob,0
Whoo-whee! Looks like Gary is cooking up some fun.,not spongebob,0
"It may not be pretty, but to a critter, chow is chow.",not spongebob,0
"Come out, come out.  Oh, there you are.  Ha ha! I've got you this time.",not spongebob,0
Ahem.,not spongebob,0
"Animal control, citizen. I'm hunting an errant snail.",not spongebob,0
"I don't give a sea fig about snails! You tripped me silent alarm!  Just look at this mess!  Take that, you varmint!  Take that!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Ow! Ow!,not spongebob,0
Looks like our boys gave Johnny law the slip again.  Reckon they're gonna need some place to lay low for a while.,not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. Looks like their hiding spot's already occupado.,not spongebob,0
"Luckily for them, Gary and Spot are already pals with everyone here.",not spongebob,0
Let's get this party started!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. Looks like the fuzz ain't gonna give up so easy.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is my jam.",not spongebob,0
They say that music soothes the savage beast.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
But sometimes it works on knuckleheads too.,not spongebob,0
"That's how you do it. You do it. You do it.  Uh, you animals are under arrest?  Uh... Uh oh.",not spongebob,0
Youch! That's gotta hurt. Oh mama!,not spongebob,0
"I guess this party just got pooped.  Luckily, SpongeBob's little Gare-bear always has something under his shell.",not spongebob,0
Locked doors are never a problem for a snail like Gary.,not spongebob,0
"Now to most animals, the pound is scarier than a bobcat in your long johns. But Gary and Spot are on a mission to save their pals.",not spongebob,0
Ah-ha!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Meow! Shhh!,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Marvin, you can catch every snail in Bikini Bottom, but the only thing you've really caught is loneliness.  And kennel cough.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Marvin here ain't kith nor kin to Gary, but that don't matter none. Gary could never bear to see anyone looking so down.",not spongebob,0
I need another snot rag.,not spongebob,0
Hey! How did you animals get out?,not spongebob,0
Wh—wh—what's going on?,not spongebob,0
Et voilà.,not spongebob,0
She's beautiful.,not spongebob,0
Oh! That's so good!,not spongebob,0
I do.,not spongebob,0
I can't thank you all enough. You brought love into my lonely life. Everybody's free to go.,not spongebob,0
Why am I running?,not spongebob,0
"With their friends rescued, it's time for our boys to finally get some shut eye.",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"After his long night of adventuring, Gary is more tired than a bronco on busting day.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up.",spongebob,1
"Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt.",spongebob,1
"Well, that's the long and short of it. See y'all next time for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
Shh!,not spongebob,0
Help! Help!,not spongebob,0
Monica!,not spongebob,0
Brad!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Monica, I've thought I might never find you.  I promise to never leave you at your side.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Brad.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Monica.",not spongebob,0
"Do you know what today is, little guy?",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
It's take Gary a walk in a park day!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down for a sec.",spongebob,1
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
Meooow.,not spongebob,0
MREOOOW REOOOOW REOOOW REOOOW! OOF!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, lightweight! What do you think you're doing with my girl?  Come on, Mary, let's go.",not spongebob,0
Mreoooow.,not spongebob,0
"You've just made a big mistake, pal.",not spongebob,0
Grrrrr...,not spongebob,0
"Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner!",spongebob,1
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
"Let's go, Mary.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I get through with yous, the doctor won't know which side to sow your lips back on... to!  That little runt is going to get what's coming to him!",not spongebob,0
Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love.  Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out.",spongebob,1
"One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye!  Night-night, Gare-Bear.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, Gary!  Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. It was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night.  Peek-a-boo!  Huh? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself.  What's this? Some sort of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover!  Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Meeooooooooow...,not spongebob,0
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
"After me, fellas.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, how come we never go through the front, guys?",not spongebob,0
'Cause the bad guys don't never use the front door!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I think that that's pretty ridiculous.",not spongebob,0
"All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... yay tall, a shell, couple of eyes?",not spongebob,0
I think you need to be more descriptive.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail thinks it's real funny to make goo-goo eyes on my girl.  Hey! What-- they's giggling at! They's giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You's all going on my list! You's got that? You're all on the list!",not spongebob,0
"Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy?  Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's.  Sounds right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test.  Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary!",spongebob,1
"Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray?  There now. Isn't that better?",not spongebob,0
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
Meow meow meow meow?,not spongebob,0
"No. No, I haven't seen any stray snails come in here.",not spongebob,0
"He's trying to pull a fast one, fellas.  Why don't we give him a taste of our special brand of swift justice?!",not spongebob,0
Two hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Heh! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a thorough job.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Let's get back to finding that snail.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Boss, there's one left.",not spongebob,0

"Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!",spongebob,1
Snailnapper?  I don't want your dumb ol' snail.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?",spongebob,1
Meow meow meow meow. Meow.,not spongebob,0

"That's gotta hurt, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
"Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can get some seaweed noodle stew!",not spongebob,0
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Don't stay out too late, Gary!  They grow up so fast.",spongebob,1
"Okay, that's enough stretching.",spongebob,1

"I don't care if he turned into a bucket of chum. I need me fry cook!  Mr. Squidward, you have the helm.",not spongebob,0
Attention Krusty Krab customers: Get out. It's time for my break.,not spongebob,0

"And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.",spongebob,1
"Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls.",not spongebob,0
Good Ol' Dutchie!,spongebob,1
"Squidward, my man, you are perfect!  Oh, no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry, fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up.  Kelp Grow! Hold still.",not spongebob,0

"Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.",spongebob,1

"Okay, okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out.  I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Then have some more!  Still want that ice cream?,not spongebob,0
"Boy, I do! Thanks, Squidward. Want some, SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam!",not spongebob,0

Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Patrick. You know, my shoes feel kinda tight.  Huh, nice and roomy.",spongebob,1
Do you want your grow juice back?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Give me that!,not spongebob,0
But you said you didn't want it.,not spongebob,0
Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?,not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'll go first.",not spongebob,0
What did you do?,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0

Meow.,not spongebob,0
There he is.,spongebob,1
Get ready.,not spongebob,0
"Now, Patrick!  There you go, Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make big money.  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.",spongebob,1
"You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!",not spongebob,0
"I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But time's a wasting! We need another good deed!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I got one! Um...you know that thing?",not spongebob,0
"Um, right, that thing that we did that day.",spongebob,1
"No, the other one. Um...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!",not spongebob,0
Are you sure?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, you'd be ugly again.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'm sure!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, how to fix his nose?",spongebob,1
"What if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it will shrink it?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's brilliant!",spongebob,1
"No, wait, don't.",not spongebob,0
That didn't work.,spongebob,1
"Well, try it again.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm. I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.",spongebob,1
Now his body is too small.,not spongebob,0
"Right, too small.",spongebob,1
Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!,not spongebob,0
I look horrible!,not spongebob,0

Scoop out his... eyeballs and use 'em as... giant... misshapen soccer balls!,not spongebob,0
"Wait. Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.",spongebob,1
"Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.",not spongebob,0
Even though you really wanted to.,spongebob,1
"Oh, quiet, you moron!",not spongebob,0
He hurt the little one's feelings.,not spongebob,0
"Why, that's not very nice at all.",not spongebob,0
"Take him down, boys!",not spongebob,0

Compliment me on my new hairdo?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure, whatever.",not spongebob,0

He taught my grandmother how to read!,not spongebob,0
He helped me start my own blimp ride company.,not spongebob,0
He helped me build a... a...,not spongebob,0
Bless you. Gesundheit.  Ahem?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
He didn't say bless you.,not spongebob,0

"Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet!",not spongebob,0
"Well, Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Where are you?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button.",spongebob,1
What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.",spongebob,1
So?,not spongebob,0
We shall do him another.  We did it!,spongebob,1
What the?,not spongebob,0
"Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one.",spongebob,1
"A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?",not spongebob,0
We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet.,spongebob,1
"Yee-haw! Get along, little amoebas!  I did it! It's sarsaparilla time!  Holy osmosis! I lived as an amoeba for a whole week!",not spongebob,0
"Can't get it to work, can never get it to work!",not spongebob,0

Whoo.,not spongebob,0
"Tell her I said, Hi!",spongebob,1
"Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, Hi!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Y'all are never gonna believe what I did this week. It's about as crazy as a mule with a top hat!,not spongebob,0
Was it crazier than this?  Tell her I said 'Hi!' Tell her I said 'Hi!',not spongebob,0
"Sorry you day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week!",not spongebob,0
"That's great, Sandy, but I've lived with a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today. He leaves his little telescope on the floor,  I rolled over it. It hurt like heck! And then, he gets mad at me for breaking it. Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car!  I'm going crazy!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're supposed to be having a good 'ol time, not a good 'ol cry.",not spongebob,0
I'm having a good time.,not spongebob,0
Me too.,not spongebob,0
"Look, guys. This is a girls night out. And I'm gonna make sure we have more fun than three rats in a pickle barrel!  Gal pals unite!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
"So, let me get this straight. Pranking Plankton will make me feel better?",not spongebob,0
You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking.,not spongebob,0
"Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.",not spongebob,0
Ready?  Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Ouch!  Krabs?! If I wasn't on probation, I'd call the cops!",not spongebob,0
"Plank-ter-ren, me old nemesis-ser!  I've got good news-erer: I'm leaving town and going back into the Navery, so I'm giving you me secret formuler-er-rer!",not spongebob,0
What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it!,not spongebob,0
It's a going away gift-erer.,not spongebob,0
I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er.,not spongebob,0
"I'll meet you there, Eugene honey!  Kiss!",not spongebob,0
I think he bought it.,not spongebob,0
Psst! Come on!,not spongebob,0
Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa!,not spongebob,0
I'm here!,not spongebob,0
Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way.",not spongebob,0
Over my dead body!,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you say, Welcher!",not spongebob,0
"Y'know, you're right, Sandy. I do feel so much better!",not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable.,not spongebob,0
Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Mm. Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Virtual reality helmet, engaged.",not spongebob,0
"Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up.",not spongebob,0
Huh? C-coming!,spongebob,1
Hello? Can I help you?,spongebob,1
"Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license.  Congratulations.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, thanks— My driver's license!",spongebob,1
And your new boat!,not spongebob,0
"My new boat!  Whoa, wow!  Am I dreaming?  Nope, it's for real.  Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving!",spongebob,1
"Oh! That voice. Yes, you're driving! You're driving me crazy!  I know! Let's make the road really bumpy!",not spongebob,0
"Wha-what? Whoa!  Whoa! Ow!  Hm, those are some potholes.",spongebob,1
"Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke.",not spongebob,0
Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob— SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Poor little guy! This is all my fault!,not spongebob,0
"No, Puff! This is all my fault!",not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
"Not now, Karen!",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Look out!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving!  Look, I got a license.  Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road!  near a construction site]",spongebob,1
"We gotta stop this cart, gal pals!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Whoa!  I'll save you, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Now I'm flying!  Whee!,spongebob,1
"Huh? Huh? Huh.  Huh?  Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly... Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! No!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, you girls got me again!  Vroom! Vroom!",spongebob,1
I know somewhere where we can finish our ladies night in peace.,not spongebob,0
"Good one.  This was a great idea, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, what a nice place to relax.",not spongebob,0
"Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving!",spongebob,1
Men.  Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?,spongebob,1
"Man! That has to be the worst amusement park I have ever been to! I mean, we're lucky to escape with our lives!",not spongebob,0
I agree! The world will be a much better place when Glove World is gone for good!,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, did you just mention Glove World?",spongebob,1
Yeah. Glove World. They're gonna close it. Tomorrow! Forever!,not spongebob,0
Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!,spongebob,1
"Well, that depends on your definition.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, I gotta go.",spongebob,1
Wh-wh-wh what about our lemonade?,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"I can't come out now, SpongeBob. I'm taking a shower.",not spongebob,0
"But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna...",spongebob,1
Glove World?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, wait!",spongebob,1
"There it is, Patrick. Glove World.",spongebob,1
"Look at that guy, he must be the owner.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World forever.",spongebob,1
Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!,not spongebob,0
"Here, son, take this. You don't wanna catch cold.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, it feels good.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, that looks glovely on you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Fits like a glove.,not spongebob,0
Glove size fits all.,spongebob,1
A penny saved is a penny gloved!,not spongebob,0
"You can leave a glove to gloves, but you can't make it glove.",spongebob,1
"She gloves me, she gloves me not.",not spongebob,0
All's fair in glove and war.,spongebob,1
Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.,not spongebob,0
"Well, enjoy the hat. Now if you folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.",not spongebob,0
"Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!",spongebob,1
Yep.,not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
"I understand your concern, but really...",not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.",spongebob,1
For all time's ride sake.,not spongebob,0
"Well, seeing as it's our last day of operation anyway, and as long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure, go right ahead!",not spongebob,0
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl.",spongebob,1
"Goodbye, Tilt-A-Hurl.",not spongebob,0
Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
We'll miss you.,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, Glove Drop.",spongebob,1
So many fun memories on this ride.,not spongebob,0
"I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave.  Where to next, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I think you know where, pal.",not spongebob,0
The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in the entire glove kingdom. And it's the last time I'm ever gonna ride it.,spongebob,1
"Come on, buddy. Let's take our seats.",not spongebob,0
Wee.,not spongebob,0
"I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World close?",spongebob,1
Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel.,not spongebob,0
"Ew, did you hear that?",spongebob,1
Excuse me.,not spongebob,0
"No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!",spongebob,1
Oh no! What am I looking at?,not spongebob,0
The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it moorings!,spongebob,1
Then you mean...,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"It somehow ripped free of it moorings!  SpongeBob, what are you doing? We must remain seated at all times!",not spongebob,0
We have to jump before this thing crashes! Come on!,spongebob,1
Bu-bu-bu-bu? But you know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!",spongebob,1
"I uh, oh, if you say so.",not spongebob,0
"Nice job, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Look!  Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.",spongebob,1
That's really gonna spoil the view for the residents of Glove Castle.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.",spongebob,1
"We've gone this far, why start now?",not spongebob,0
All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World is closing. I mean just look around you. Open your eyes.,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Move it, slowpoke!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, who you calling slowpoke, you sardine!",not spongebob,0
"See what I mean, Patrick? Glove World is on its last legs.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, or on its last finger.",not spongebob,0
I just wish there was something we can do.,spongebob,1
I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World to cheer ourselves up.,not spongebob,0
Wait a second.  That's it!,spongebob,1
It is?,not spongebob,0
"Of course, we just have to fix Glove World.",spongebob,1
We do?,not spongebob,0
"Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World open. Are you with me?",spongebob,1
"I think so. Yeah, I'm here.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, this is it. Do you remember what to say?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...",not spongebob,0
Hall of mirrors.,spongebob,1
Hall of Mirrors!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, new and improved?  Wow, that's fantastic!",not spongebob,0
It's working.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll try it.  Hey! What kind of mirror is this!?",not spongebob,0
Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm glad they're closing this place down!,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, kid.  Ow! You little brat! I have had it! Three and a half weeks of working here and this is how I'm treated!? You're gonna have to pay for my shin-replacement surgery!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry you feel that way, but if we were to accommodate every employee-",not spongebob,0
"Accommodate this, boss man!",not spongebob,0
Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Owner, Mr. Owner! Can I wear the Glovey Glove costume? Please, please? I've always wanted to try it on. And also, this hat you lent me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See?",not spongebob,0
"Well, sure, why not? I mean, what could go wrong?",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, little boy.",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh! Glove ice cream!  Thanks!",not spongebob,0
"The park mascot, cutting in line?",not spongebob,0
And he stole my ice cream!,not spongebob,0
I thought he gave it to me.,not spongebob,0
"Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix.  Excuse me.  Much better.  Ooh.  There.",spongebob,1
"Huh? Hey, I landed safely!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, we landed safely!",not spongebob,0
He's insane! Run for your lives!,not spongebob,0
Come back here!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, stop! What are you doing?",spongebob,1
I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Patrick, do you hear that?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's the sound of total silence.  Plus tumbleweeds.",not spongebob,0
"Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World, and now it's over. And they're gonna close it, and there's nothing we can do.",spongebob,1
"Well, there is one thing we can do.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
"We're doing what any concerned, responsible person does when they're left no other choice.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, brother! We're chaining ourselves to a gate.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I hope you don't plan on staying chained for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.",not spongebob,0
The grand what?,not spongebob,0
"The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself.",not spongebob,0
Glove Universe?!,not spongebob,0
"Isn't she something?  Well, you two have a good night.",not spongebob,0
"Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!",spongebob,1
You bet!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.",spongebob,1
What key?,not spongebob,0
The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.,spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you told me to keep that in a safe place, remember?",not spongebob,0
So where you keeping it?,spongebob,1
At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will ever find it!  SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone, too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise?  No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you, Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again!  Ooh, my driver's license!  That's the baby.  Hi, fella, it's me.  It's okay, I'm licensed.  Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la-  -la-la-la...  Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  No!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-!  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke.",spongebob,1
You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you.,not spongebob,0
"Who, Boaty?  Oh no. He's... Really?",spongebob,1
I can't talk now. He's watching us.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick! Don't go!  Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed.",spongebob,1
Three days later...,not spongebob,0
"Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?",spongebob,1
"Sheesh. Calm down, boy.",not spongebob,0
"You're all still alive? Well, where did you go?",spongebob,1
It was National No SpongeBob Day.,not spongebob,0
National No SpongeBob Day?,spongebob,1
Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you.,not spongebob,0
A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks.,spongebob,1
Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little.,not spongebob,0
"You too, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from...,not spongebob,0
I'm... glad you had fun.,spongebob,1
"Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"Of course.  First, we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground.  Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby!  And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Wow. A whole day dedicated to me.,spongebob,1
"Big deal. Wait 'til you see No Patrick Day. Come on, everyone. Let's go!  Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh.",spongebob,1
"No, no, just—",not spongebob,0
Whoa.,spongebob,1
"It's harder to walk, but worth it.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.",spongebob,1
So many flavors.,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?",spongebob,1
"No, that's too fancy.",not spongebob,0
Rocky road!,not spongebob,0
With real rocks!,not spongebob,0
"Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.",spongebob,1
Bump.  When did food get so ugly?,not spongebob,0
"Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier. Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.",not spongebob,0
"Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!",not spongebob,0
"So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?",not spongebob,0
Call me Don.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir.",not spongebob,0
Ooh. Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-",spongebob,1
Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.,not spongebob,0
"The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time,  like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, oh, it's absolutely...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course...",not spongebob,0
Just gross.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no, it's disgusting.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't think old is gross.",not spongebob,0
"Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!",not spongebob,0
"Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.",not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible.  Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty.  And finally, Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!",spongebob,1
"Oh, uh, Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice.",spongebob,1
"Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
"The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.",not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
Someone everyone can relate to...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, me, me!",spongebob,1
"With a face that says, I love Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"We find that face, and we have our campaign.",not spongebob,0
And I've got the perfect guy for the job.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that was my slogan.",spongebob,1
"Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!",not spongebob,0
I'm already a star.,not spongebob,0
That's the attitude.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.",not spongebob,0
I—oh...,spongebob,1
"Don, will this commercial really help me make money?",not spongebob,0
"You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.",not spongebob,0
"I told you, call me Don.",not spongebob,0
Don.,not spongebob,0
"Of course, you could double, maybe even triple or quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.",not spongebob,0
What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?,not spongebob,0
"Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.",not spongebob,0
How much a lot more?,not spongebob,0
A lot a lot more.,not spongebob,0
"Well, then let's fill her up with filler!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?",spongebob,1
"Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.",not spongebob,0
But what is filler?,spongebob,1
"Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?",not spongebob,0
"Ho-ho, that sounds great!",not spongebob,0
"Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smell like money?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, why does that barrel say sand?",spongebob,1
"Well, it's imported. It's spelled sand but it's pronounced, filler.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.",not spongebob,0
Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.,not spongebob,0
"Would you buy it, though?",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy  Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.",not spongebob,0
He loves it.,not spongebob,0
"Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"I'm rich, boy-o, rich!",not spongebob,0
"Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?",spongebob,1
"Yes, yes, we can.",not spongebob,0
"Hooray, finally!",spongebob,1
"Whatcha doing, boy?",not spongebob,0
Making Krabby Patties.,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
You mean my last one for the morning rush?,spongebob,1
"No, ever.",not spongebob,0
You mean my last one for today-ever?,spongebob,1
"No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
Fired?,spongebob,1
But I'm ready to re-hire you.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.",spongebob,1
Then follow me.,not spongebob,0
This tastes nice.,not spongebob,0
"Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.",not spongebob,0
You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?,spongebob,1
"That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?",spongebob,1
"Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.",not spongebob,0
Ding.,not spongebob,0
"You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, it's so convenient, see?",not spongebob,0
And what about me?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
"Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?",not spongebob,0
"Heh! No, you're just fired.",not spongebob,0
"What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  Dear Mr. Krabs—",not spongebob,0
"Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.",not spongebob,0
"What the—what?!  I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!",not spongebob,0
"Ahem,  hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.",spongebob,1
"Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.",spongebob,1
"Atta boy, embrace the future!",not spongebob,0
Going up?,not spongebob,0
I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.,spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again.,spongebob,1
You should get out. Now.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.",spongebob,1
"Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.,not spongebob,0
"I'll come with you, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.,not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
Aww.,not spongebob,0
"This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?",not spongebob,0
The next day...,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, oof!",spongebob,1
Ow.,not spongebob,0
Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.,spongebob,1
"I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.",not spongebob,0
I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.,spongebob,1
I love my job. Thanks for coming!,not spongebob,0
Totally out of character.,not spongebob,0
"I hate everyone.  Huh, much better.",not spongebob,0
Later...,not spongebob,0
Tastes so nice that they—,not spongebob,0
They taste like lice!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
What are you doing with this—ow!,not spongebob,0
Tastes so nice that they taste nice.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?",spongebob,1
"Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure. I get it.",spongebob,1
But he's my friend.,not spongebob,0
You're a star. You have no friends.,not spongebob,0
What am I doing again?,not spongebob,0
Stand over here and say your line. And...action.,not spongebob,0
"Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...",not spongebob,0
"And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.,not spongebob,0
Speak for yourself.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!",spongebob,1
"Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.",not spongebob,0
"See you later, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"Finally, now is my chance to strike.",not spongebob,0
Welcome to the original Krusty—,spongebob,1
"Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.",not spongebob,0
"Pfft, never happened.",not spongebob,0
Now to make my escape.,not spongebob,0
Aren't you gonna try and stop me?,not spongebob,0
"That'll be $1.99, please.",spongebob,1
"What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.",not spongebob,0
Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.,spongebob,1
See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!,spongebob,1
"Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.",not spongebob,0
Ding.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, you fools!",not spongebob,0
Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?",spongebob,1
"Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.",spongebob,1
Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?,not spongebob,0
Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.,spongebob,1
"Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?",not spongebob,0
That's it! I can't take it anymore! Everybody out!,not spongebob,0
I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.,not spongebob,0
"Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.",spongebob,1
Patrick!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!",spongebob,1
I thought they tasted familiar!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Missed you.,spongebob,1
I missed you too.,not spongebob,0
"I got something for you, from one friend to another.",spongebob,1
"No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!",not spongebob,0
"Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.",not spongebob,0
"Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand?,not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.",not spongebob,0
"And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...",not spongebob,0
That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...,not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.",spongebob,1
...Made with sand!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
That was cute when you were rich.  I'm out of here.,not spongebob,0
"And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?",not spongebob,0
Now that's the taste I remember.,not spongebob,0
That's strange.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?",not spongebob,0
"Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, did you do all this?",not spongebob,0
"Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.",spongebob,1
"A friend always helps. It's called frelping, and I was very frelpful.",not spongebob,0
But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.,not spongebob,0
"The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.",spongebob,1
Fresh?,not spongebob,0
"Go on, have a bite.",spongebob,1
"No, no I—",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.",spongebob,1
Here!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing, we're not selling them.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, we just give them away.",not spongebob,0
"Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?",not spongebob,0
Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!,spongebob,1
"Great, now get back to work!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob...,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!",not spongebob,0
I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.,spongebob,1
"Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.",not spongebob,0
"My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.",spongebob,1
"You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.",not spongebob,0
"What's that, Squidward?",spongebob,1
It's Sunday!  A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!,not spongebob,0
"Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgot his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him.  Man this is heavy.  Oh, pardon me.",spongebob,1
"Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!",not spongebob,0
AHH!!! Monster!,spongebob,1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!,not spongebob,0
"Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday.  My Sunday relaxation kit.  Let's see…pillow.  Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance.  Ah, and the final touch.  Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man.  This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot.  Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder, take me on a chocolate vacation.",not spongebob,0
Ooooooooohhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
Ooooooohhhhh!,spongebob,1
"By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.",not spongebob,0
What are you two idiots doing?,not spongebob,0
Secret ritual.,not spongebob,0
To inaugurate you as president.,spongebob,1
Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.,not spongebob,0
"No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.",not spongebob,0
Better?,not spongebob,0
You're the president of The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge!,spongebob,1
"The WHAT?! Oh, is this some stupid club you two made up?!",not spongebob,0
Hehehehe...maybe.,not spongebob,0
It's a secret.,spongebob,1
"Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer?  Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays.",not spongebob,0
"What color should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?",spongebob,1
Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.,not spongebob,0
Wow. Polka dots.,not spongebob,0
Our new president is a genius.,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"See ya later, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Whenever you're ready, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hold still, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.",spongebob,1
Okie dokie.,not spongebob,0
"Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.",not spongebob,0
Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.,not spongebob,0
What's going on out there?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the-",spongebob,1
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! MY EYES!!,not spongebob,0
Look out!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you poor man.",not spongebob,0
You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.,not spongebob,0
"No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh…",not spongebob,0
"See ya later, neighbor!",not spongebob,0
It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick.  Okay…Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?",spongebob,1
"Did you find him, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.,spongebob,1
Or maybe he's on a secret mission.,not spongebob,0
I hope he's not in danger.,spongebob,1
Danger?!,not spongebob,0
"As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.",spongebob,1
Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?,not spongebob,0
"Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.",spongebob,1
At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to.  What are you two doing in my house?,not spongebob,0
We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.,spongebob,1
I say he checks out a-ok.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips?",spongebob,1
"French tips, huh?  Alright, pal, make with the relaxing foot massage, pronto!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, you two! OUT!!!  And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day! Or tomorrow! Or next week!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, does that include…",spongebob,1
"YES, IT DOES!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?",spongebob,1
"YES, I WAS! You call yourselves good neighbors? YOU'RE THE WORST NEIGHBORS EVER!  You don't deserve to wear those fezzes!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.",not spongebob,0
"NO, YOU AREN'T!!! YOU'RE HORRIBLE NEIGHBORS!!!  AND STOP CALLING ME PRESIDENT!!!",not spongebob,0
"C'mon, let's go.",spongebob,1
There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper.,not spongebob,0
Good neighbors my right.  Hello? Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation,not spongebob,0
System Activated.,not spongebob,0
That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.,not spongebob,0
President Squidward?,spongebob,1
What the…?!,not spongebob,0
We hereby present you with this delicious cake.,spongebob,1
"Sorry for bugging you so much? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!",not spongebob,0
No threat detected.,not spongebob,0
Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!,not spongebob,0
Threat detected.,not spongebob,0
What's going on?,not spongebob,0
Threat detected. Code red. Code red!,not spongebob,0
It's like a carnival ride!,spongebob,1
"Run for your lives!  What the-? What are you doing?!  I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me.",not spongebob,0
Fire!,not spongebob,0
Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.,not spongebob,0
"We gotta turn this thing off.  Nope, not it.",spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Nope.,spongebob,1
"That's not it, either.",not spongebob,0
This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot.,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No-no, don't say anything. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Mr. President-,spongebob,1
Shush.,not spongebob,0
But we just wanted to…,spongebob,1
Get out of my house! Huh?,not spongebob,0
There he is!,not spongebob,0
Are you the owner of this house?,not spongebob,0
"Yes! Yes, I am!",not spongebob,0
"Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom,  I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!",spongebob,1
Ha!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Krabs!,not spongebob,0
I'll take that.,not spongebob,0
How'd you know it was me?,not spongebob,0
"Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.",not spongebob,0
Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.,not spongebob,0
You think? SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Wooo-ooo!,spongebob,1
"3, 2, 1…, launch!",not spongebob,0
AAHH!,not spongebob,0
Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I resent that! Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it.",not spongebob,0
"Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies!",not spongebob,0
"I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!  Oh, aren't you just too cute.  Coochie coochie coo!",spongebob,1
"Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure thing, Plankton.  Here you go, little guy.",spongebob,1
"Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!  Hello.",not spongebob,0
Police! Police!,spongebob,1
"Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  That was easy. I'm free! Free!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby!  It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula!  What do we do, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break.",not spongebob,0
…and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.,not spongebob,0
"Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time, spray SpongeBob, too.",not spongebob,0
Not sure I follow you.,not spongebob,0
Listen carefully. Spray...,not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
...Sponge....,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
....Bob.....,not spongebob,0
Right.,not spongebob,0
....Too!,not spongebob,0
Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
That's just what I…,not spongebob,0
"I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s?",spongebob,1
Hands in the air!,not spongebob,0
Plankton!,spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal?  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote!  One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult?  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!",not spongebob,0
Ahem!,not spongebob,0
"Krabs! Nice diaper.  Hold on, hold on! I think I...  Yes, I've got it!",not spongebob,0
Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!,not spongebob,0
Peek-a-boo!,not spongebob,0
I can't tolerate your stinky gas!,not spongebob,0
That makes two of us.,not spongebob,0
I don't do it on purpose!,not spongebob,0
"You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…a nother penny! Come to papa! Now, what were we doing?",not spongebob,0
"This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!",not spongebob,0
"Eh? What was that, sonny?",not spongebob,0
"Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless.",not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!",spongebob,1
I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again!,not spongebob,0
I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.,spongebob,1
This baby gas is worthless!  At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
"What was that, sonny?",spongebob,1
It'll take more time to explain than you have left.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!,not spongebob,0
Catch who?,spongebob,1
"Oh, Gesundheit.",not spongebob,0
Victory is mine!,not spongebob,0
"Come back here, you little whippersnapper!",spongebob,1
"You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!",not spongebob,0
I'm catching up with my knitting.,spongebob,1
"That's it! Knit, little nitwit!",not spongebob,0
That was almost too easy.  What? No! I demand you geezers release me!,not spongebob,0
Right after the party. The piñata party.,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's for calling us old.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, quit it!",not spongebob,0
I want candy!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?",not spongebob,0
You mean the Kelp-O?,not spongebob,0
"No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.",not spongebob,0
Are you talking about my baby? creep!,not spongebob,0
"Ow, ow, ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow, ow, ow, ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!",not spongebob,0
Just like all your other plans that couldn't possibly fail?,not spongebob,0
"What is it now, Karen?",not spongebob,0
I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!,not spongebob,0
That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig!,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, don't you dare!",not spongebob,0
Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!,not spongebob,0
"Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch!",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, little feller?",spongebob,1
That was loud.,not spongebob,0
"All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon.  SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.  Bubble wand.  Mesh tank top.  And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.,spongebob,1
"Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Oh.  Pom-poms,  megaphone, and spirit!",not spongebob,0
Uh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader?,not spongebob,0
Yes I do!,not spongebob,0
"Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon!",not spongebob,0
Eww!,not spongebob,0
Huh?  Mm!,not spongebob,0
"No, that moon.",not spongebob,0
Ohh!,not spongebob,0
"Squidina, what did you bring?",not spongebob,0
"Eyeglasses,  comic books,  and action figures.",not spongebob,0
"Ugh, can a person be any nerdier?",not spongebob,0
I can.,spongebob,1
Ew!,not spongebob,0
"Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it.",not spongebob,0
Science!,spongebob,1
Everyone on board for lift-off.,not spongebob,0
Ouch!,not spongebob,0
"Let's go, Scout!",not spongebob,0
But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.,spongebob,1
The moon is in perfect position for us to launch.  We gotta leave now!,not spongebob,0
Hello? Delivery.  Did someone order a Krabby Patty?  Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks.  Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all.",not spongebob,0
Safety first.,spongebob,1
"Uh, why you!",spongebob,1
"Uhh, everything okay back there, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,spongebob,1
"Three, two, one, launch!  Whoops! Lunch.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying!  Whoop!",spongebob,1
This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G.,not spongebob,0
I've never been so light before.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, I gotta fix that.",not spongebob,0
"Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes.  I don't care. Oh, no! Help me!  Hey! Watch it, you big orca!",not spongebob,0
"You watch it, you big dorka!",not spongebob,0
"There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind!  All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped!  Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief.  All my stress is gone.  All my stress is back!",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh, we've got space junk!  Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now!",not spongebob,0
Home run!,spongebob,1
We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt!,not spongebob,0
"Next up, we got a hot belt!",not spongebob,0
Patty melt.,spongebob,1
"Ow!  Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets!",not spongebob,0
Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face!,not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now.  Let's see where we are.  Craters, craters— Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf.  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here.  How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?",spongebob,1
"I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose.",not spongebob,0
"Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home!  Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here.  Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out.  Maybe this one?",not spongebob,0
Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha?,not spongebob,0
Third time's a charm?,not spongebob,0
One small step for a squirrel...,not spongebob,0
Ooh!  One giant leap for SpongeKind.,spongebob,1
"All right, Science Scouts, everyone's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity.",not spongebob,0
"Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh!",not spongebob,0
"Squidina, you collect moon rocks.",not spongebob,0
"Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks!",not spongebob,0
Grrr-avity!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life.",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm...",spongebob,1
"You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure.  I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains.",spongebob,1
"If you find anything, just toot.  Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts.",not spongebob,0
I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you!,not spongebob,0
No one beats the nerd out of Squidina!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!  Missed me!,not spongebob,0
Science! Yay!,not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all,  SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"This moon is a no SpongeBob zone!  Here, I'm the man on the moon!",not spongebob,0
"Um, did someone say, Man on the Moon?  Hello?  Intelligent life?  How about average smarts?  I'd settle for common sense!  Ooh! Intelligent footprints.  Huh?  Wha-hoo!  I found it! I found it!",spongebob,1
"What'd you find, SpaceBob?",not spongebob,0
Intelligent life.,spongebob,1
"I'm not so sure about that.  If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating",spongebob,1
You're right! It's lunch time.  Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared?,not spongebob,0
You bet! Just call me LunchBob.,spongebob,1
Just press the button labeled lunch!,not spongebob,0
"No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp— Whoa! The dark side of the moon.  SpongeBob? Are you in here?  No SpongeBob.  I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy?",not spongebob,0
"Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is.",spongebob,1
Preparing to launch.,not spongebob,0
"No!  No, not launch! Lunch!",spongebob,1
"Uh, wait, wait—what's going on?",not spongebob,0
How should I know?,not spongebob,0
You guys wait here!  Phew! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, Sandy!  Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses.",spongebob,1
"It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together.  Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides.",not spongebob,0
Water's a little dry today.,not spongebob,0
And that last launch depleted our fuel.,not spongebob,0
Ho-ho-ho.,not spongebob,0
That's weird.,not spongebob,0
I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader!,not spongebob,0
I'm sorry you're a nerd!,not spongebob,0
That came out wrong!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me.  Come on, Sandy, bring it on in.",spongebob,1
"It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth.",not spongebob,0
"But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from... in there.",not spongebob,0
Ho-ho-ho.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Squidward? You're the man on the moon?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?!  Of course. Why not?,not spongebob,0
Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.],not spongebob,0
Ohh!  Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this.,not spongebob,0
"Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes...",spongebob,1
"I know, trouble follows.",not spongebob,0
I was gonna say laughter follows.,spongebob,1
"Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side?",not spongebob,0
The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep.  I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums.  Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again.",not spongebob,0
"Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth?",not spongebob,0
"Good question, Mr. Claus.",spongebob,1
We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel.,not spongebob,0
A controlled explosion might move the moon back.,not spongebob,0
"Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that?",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.,spongebob,1
Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts!,not spongebob,0
"No go, the moon's too heavy.",not spongebob,0
I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas.,not spongebob,0
Perfection!,not spongebob,0
Now we just wait for a gust of wind.,spongebob,1
"Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind.",not spongebob,0
Why don't we just push the moon back?,spongebob,1
You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! Get it? Kraken?,not spongebob,0
"Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, Ho-ho-ho! at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help!",not spongebob,0
"But I'm having such a jolly, holly time!  You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice.",not spongebob,0
Everyone nestled all snug?,not spongebob,0
"We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure.",spongebob,1
"I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace!  First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box.",not spongebob,0
Jack-in-the-box.,spongebob,1
"Oh, oh! Let me try!",spongebob,1
Be careful! Don't overwind it!,not spongebob,0
But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon.,spongebob,1
"You broke it, and it was my last one.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm.  Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you!",spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho-ho!,not spongebob,0
"What happened?  Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad.",spongebob,1
"Oh, excuse me. Sorry.",not spongebob,0
Oh-oh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Oh-oh-oh?,spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho backwards.,not spongebob,0
"Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag?",spongebob,1
"Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Santa, squirt me.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I get it.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa!",spongebob,1
"Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, the rocket burped us back.",not spongebob,0
Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff.",not spongebob,0
"Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics!",not spongebob,0
"Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you.  Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight.",spongebob,1
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot.",spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas.",spongebob,1
Come on!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas!",spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace!,not spongebob,0
"How about a little more, Plankton, or has this old granny had enough for one night?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that looks simply delightful!",not spongebob,0
You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.,not spongebob,0
Ration?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, chocolate. Open up! (feeds the pudding to Grandma) You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me. (wipes off the pudding) There you are. There you are, darling.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton. You always were my favorite granddaughter!",not spongebob,0
"Five minutes until bedtime, Mr. Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...",not spongebob,0
"Five minutes, Mr. Plank...",not spongebob,0
"I heard you the first time! Now, where were we? (Grandma is asleep) Grandma, don't forget your teeth.",not spongebob,0
(spits out teeth and coughs),not spongebob,0
"Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there. (Grandma is asleep) That's perfect! (puts the teeth in his mouth) Perfect! (laughs evilly) Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say No to a helpless little grandma! (thinking. He is at the Krusty Krab. 'female voice) Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?",not spongebob,0
"Goodness, no! (gives the formula to her) Here you are.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there. (laughs evilly as imagery fades) '(Bubble transition)",not spongebob,0
"La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la! (playing in the bathtub. He shoots a squirt of water with his hands. The squirt of water goes through his holes at the top of his head then lands on the bar of soap) Yay! A direct hit! (uses a bar of soap as a walkie-talkie) Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, prepare to dive! Repeat: prepare to di-- (Plankton, disguised as Grandma knocks on the door. He clears his throat) Hi, lady!",spongebob,1
"(female voice) Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?",not spongebob,0
"Ehh, not really...",spongebob,1
"It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!",not spongebob,0
"(gasps) Quick, come inside! (inside of the pineapple) Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?",spongebob,1
"I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...",not spongebob,0
"I'm so glad you came back... (rubs his finger across Plankton's chin) ...Double-Great Grammyma. (Plankton pushes it away and shudders) You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy. (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) Okay, lean forward. (Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. (Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) How about we look through some old family photo albums? (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. (a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?",spongebob,1
"It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... (shows stacks of photo albums) ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.",spongebob,1
Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. (it is night which turns to morning and rooster crows everyone up. SpongeBob and Plankton are asleep. SpongeBob wakes up and exclaims. He looks happily at Plankton),not spongebob,0
Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?,spongebob,1
"Huh?!? Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! (looks up to see SpongeBob still looking happily at him) Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!",spongebob,1
"Uh, sounds delightful. (takes off glasses. evilly laughs) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. (puts on more lipstick. Bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking down the street)",not spongebob,0
"So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?",spongebob,1
"Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?",not spongebob,0
Hmmmm... (flashback of Plankton),spongebob,1
"I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...",not spongebob,0
"(goes back to the present) No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.",spongebob,1
"Well, uh...",not spongebob,0
"(grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him) Come on, it'll be fun! (Bubble transitions over to the place called Grandma's Tea House. SpongeBob drinks tea) Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?",spongebob,1
"Why, yes! (drinks the tea then spits it out on a coaster) How can you drink this dreck?! (all of the grandmas gasp) Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, More, please. (bubble transitions to other grandmas and SpongeBob knitting)",not spongebob,0
"Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?",spongebob,1
Nope. (he has his arms in a yarn circle),not spongebob,0
Why are you not having fun?,spongebob,1
"Why?! Because I don't knit, you nitwit! (his yarn circle gets pulled and so does he by a grandma)",not spongebob,0
"Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. (Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta masta! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) Grandma, you getting bored?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I could eat a village!",not spongebob,0
Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?,spongebob,1
"(reacts) Would I? (laughs. Then laughs maniacally. He clears his throat) Uh, yeah, I would. (bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking to the front entrance of the Krusty Krab) Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?",spongebob,1
"Antenna... What?! No, I...!",not spongebob,0
"(laughs) Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... (Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ...Squidward!",spongebob,1
AAAH!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!",not spongebob,0
I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.,spongebob,1
Your what?,not spongebob,0
"My great-grammyma! (points to Plankton but he's not there) She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.",not spongebob,0
"Right... (starts dumping the garbage in the trash can) SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. (Plankton is hiding in the trash can. He gets a lot of garbage all over him. He starts coughing. SpongeBob walks over to the trash can)",not spongebob,0
"Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.",spongebob,1
Never mind. Just get me into the kitchen!,not spongebob,0
"(cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) Well, here it is.",spongebob,1
At last!,not spongebob,0
"Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties.",spongebob,1
"Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha... What?",spongebob,1
"Nothing, go ahead! (laughs menacingly. He pulls out a green balloon which is a decoy of him dressed as Grandma. He stretches it then blows it up) Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (the balloon floats away and goes above Plankton who is checking under the dirty plates for the formula. The balloon lands in the drain of the sink)",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... (calls) Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dish-washing while I have the chance. (walks to the sink) The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. (turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! (the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) Oh, I can't bear to look! (starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!",not spongebob,0
"Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?",spongebob,1
"Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.",spongebob,1
Why would he?,not spongebob,0
(carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash) Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I feel better already. (begins snoring)",not spongebob,0
"Sweet dreams, Grammyma. (closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up)",spongebob,1
"Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr. Krabs! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! (Grandma Plankton's teeth fall out) I'm just going to savor this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel truly alive! (Grandma Plankton grabs her teeth)",not spongebob,0
"Plankton! (Plankton gasps. Grandma Plankton takes her glasses off his face) You've been a very naughty boy, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"B-But-But-But I... (Grandma Plankton takes her wig off his head) Grandma, I can... (Grandma Plankton takes her dress off Plankton's body)",not spongebob,0
I've been looking all over for this stuff!,not spongebob,0
"Grandma, I can explain!",not spongebob,0
"(grabs Plankton by his right antenna and drags him out of the kitchen) I'm sure you can. Plankton Jr., you know you always were a... (stops at one of SpongeBob's feet)",not spongebob,0
"Grandma? (gasps) You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?",spongebob,1
"Get out of my way, rapscallion! (SpongeBob does so) I've had enough foolishness for one day. (Plankton groans. Grandma Plankton drags him out of the Krusty Krab. The episode ends)",not spongebob,0
"There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Grandma!",spongebob,1
"Come in and sit for a while.  Have a cookie, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies...",spongebob,1
"Now, who wants to lick the spoon?",not spongebob,0
"Me, me, me!",spongebob,1
...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.,not spongebob,0
Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!,spongebob,1
"Hop in my car, I'll drop you off.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Grandma!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy!",not spongebob,0
"I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.",spongebob,1
"I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.",not spongebob,0
Did I do something funny?,spongebob,1
Your forehead.,not spongebob,0
My forehead is funny?,spongebob,1
"Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy!",not spongebob,0
"No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.",spongebob,1
"No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers!  And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um...  ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and...",not spongebob,0
All right already!,not spongebob,0
"Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.",not spongebob,0
"Really? You do, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, your grandma!",not spongebob,0
HaHaHaHaHaHa!!!,not spongebob,0
STOOOOOP IIIIIIIIT!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time!,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Me, too.",spongebob,1
You're the most adult person I know.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.",spongebob,1
"Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say, tax exemption!",not spongebob,0
Tax exemption!,spongebob,1
"Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  ...Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you gonna tell Grandma?",not spongebob,0
I'm a grown up!,spongebob,1
"No ifs, ands, or buts about it!",not spongebob,0
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!,spongebob,1
And then you get behind her and I'll push!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we didn't say that!!!",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah, right.",not spongebob,0
All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years...!,spongebob,1
Sideburns!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.",spongebob,1
"Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.",not spongebob,0
"He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you are absolutely right.",not spongebob,0
"I am? I mean, of course I am.",spongebob,1
You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.,not spongebob,0
"I am glad you see it my way, grandmother.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm glad that's settled.  But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick?",spongebob,1
"Keep 'em coming, Granny!",not spongebob,0
So much for no more baby stuff.,spongebob,1
And don't forget the cookie-eating hat!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.",spongebob,1
"Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.",not spongebob,0
"Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?!  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults!",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy.  Who's the baby?",not spongebob,0
"I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.",not spongebob,0
Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup.,spongebob,1
Here's a fresh batch of cookies.,not spongebob,0
"All right!  Rewards, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz...",spongebob,1
"Oh, Grandma, I'm full.",not spongebob,0
More cookies!,not spongebob,0
It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do.,spongebob,1
"Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral?",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious.",spongebob,1
Storytime!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!",not spongebob,0
Storytime?,spongebob,1
"You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun.  Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book.  Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it.",spongebob,1
D'oh! My wittle finger!,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, hold still.  All better?",not spongebob,0
Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too.,not spongebob,0
How about I give you a present?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  ALRIGHT! Another hat!",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, it's a sweater.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
With love in every stitch.,not spongebob,0
"No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I almost forgot.  Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind.  Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.",spongebob,1
"Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, that is it. Here I go.",spongebob,1
Come again if you get the chance.,not spongebob,0
"Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.",spongebob,1
Toodleloo.,not spongebob,0
I don't know when I'll be back.,spongebob,1
I know how busy you are.,not spongebob,0
"So, uh... that's it.",spongebob,1
"Shh, he's asleep.",not spongebob,0
Soooo loooong...  I DON'T WANNA GROW UP!  I want cookies!  and milkie!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear diadies!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo!,spongebob,1
"Take it easy, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!  You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.",not spongebob,0
I don't?,spongebob,1
"Of course not.  No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo.  And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult.  Here you go.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
No problem.,not spongebob,0
Wah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic.",not spongebob,0
"It's all about you today, Karen.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this makes up of a lot of your stupidity lately, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton's stepped away for a moment. The name's Ray Ray, and I am at your service, m'lady.  Pow!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, kiss me, pipsqueak. I mean, Ray Ray.",not spongebob,0
Grandma?! I told you never to call me on this screen.,not spongebob,0
"Sheldon,  is that you?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, it's me, Grandma. Always nice to hear from you. Okay, gotta go.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, sweetie. See you tomorrow at 8 AM sharp.",not spongebob,0
"Right, see you then. Wait a minute, what? 8 AM? Um, what's happening at 8 AM, Grandma?",not spongebob,0
"Don't you remember, silly?  You promised me you'd own  the Krusty Krab by my 90th birthday. Well, my 90th is tomorrow! You do own the Krusty Krab now, right?",not spongebob,0
"Lie, that's it!  Uh, you're darn right I own the Krusty Krab, Grandma, and I can't wait to give you the grand tour, uh, tomorrow morning.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, see you then.",not spongebob,0
That smack was for Plankton.  Now bring back Ray Ray.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what am I gonna do, Karen? How am I gonna fool Grandma tomorrow?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay, I guess bath time is over.  Why don't you and Ray Ray take a long walk off a short plank?",not spongebob,0
"Gotta think, gotta think.  Come on, brain!",not spongebob,0
"This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty!  Whoo!  Whoop, whoop.  Ooh.  Aah.  Whew. ' Ow!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBoob, you gotta help me.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?",spongebob,1
"This is not an evil scheme.  The truth is I promised my grandma I would own the Krusty Krab by her 90th birthday. So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it.",spongebob,1
I'm not gonna buy what?,not spongebob,0
One Pathetic Sob-Story Later...,not spongebob,0
I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.,not spongebob,0
"I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye.",not spongebob,0
"That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth.",spongebob,1
"You know,  I have a grandma too.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"All right, I buy it.",not spongebob,0
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"First things first.  That should keep it safe for six to eight hours.  All right, me pretties, let's make this place pro-Plankton pronto!",not spongebob,0
"Now everyone remember, for the rest of the day, Plankton is the—  Plankton's boss.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Grandma. Happy birthday.",not spongebob,0
"Nice to see you again, Grandma Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Ugh. Who invited C-Pee-Eww?,not spongebob,0
"All right, I tried.",not spongebob,0
"Owuh!  Let me help you with your bag, Grandma.  Ouch!",not spongebob,0
"Well, here we are, Grandma. Welcome to the Krusty Plankton. I named it after you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, aren't you a sweet grandson?  Who are they?",not spongebob,0
"They're just my employees, Grandma. Meet SpongeBob and Eugene.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Grandma Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"They look like very nice boys, and I'll bet they're even nicer when they're working.",not spongebob,0
"You heard, Grandma! We ain't running a welcome wagon here! Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure thing, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"That's Mr. Plankton to you, busboy.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Plankton. It won't happen again.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, look, that one's napping on the job.",not spongebob,0
"Nap time's over, loafer!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, who's the wise guy?",not spongebob,0
"Ohh.  Oh, my goodness! Who is this handsome young man?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's Squidward. He's nobody. Moving along...",not spongebob,0
Mm. Squidward. Didn't we meet at an early bird dinner?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer!  Ow!",spongebob,1
"All right, lady, I don't normally say this,  but get off my nose.",not spongebob,0
"Go along with it, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Or you're fired.,not spongebob,0
"So, Grandma Plankton, where have you been all my life?",not spongebob,0
Call me Lily.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Grandma, you're embarrassing me now.",not spongebob,0
"To the kitchen, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Try one of our Planky Patties, Grandma. Fresh off the grill.",not spongebob,0
"I'll need my teeth for this.  Whoops.  Oops. I dropped my choppers. Oh, well. I guess Squidward will have to chew it for me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure, I'll—what?!  Aah.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, chew it up real good. That's enough. My turn.",not spongebob,0
Aah.,not spongebob,0
Aah.  Delicious.,not spongebob,0
Ew!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Sheldon, you've outdone yourself. You really are a master chef.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Sheldon.  You've really made my birthday something extra special this year.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Grandma.  Got your bag? You are out the door and that is that.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, just one more thing.",not spongebob,0
My last birthday wish is to get a photo of me posing with the Krabby Patty secret formula.,not spongebob,0
Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Fine. Anything to get that bag with the bag out of here.,not spongebob,0
Say cheese.,not spongebob,0
Cheese.,not spongebob,0
Ahhh!,not spongebob,0
"Finally, the secret formula is mine!",not spongebob,0
"I knew your sincerity was insincere, sir!",not spongebob,0
"I didn't know anything about this, Eugene, honest! But I love it! Now we can rule the world as a family, eh, Grandma?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Sheldon, but I'm not sharing the formula with you!",not spongebob,0
But Grandma!,not spongebob,0
"Adios, mi amour! Mmmm.",not spongebob,0
Why? Why did I lie?,not spongebob,0
Why? Why did I pretend?,spongebob,1
Why?  Why did I give her my formula?,not spongebob,0
Why? Why wouldn't we be open on Tuesday? Idiot!,not spongebob,0
What have we done?,not spongebob,0
I have the secret formula!  This world is mine!,not spongebob,0
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!,not spongebob,0
"Darling,  why don't you toss the peasants a little something?",not spongebob,0
My leg!,not spongebob,0
"I'll take that, thank you very much.  Safe and sound.",not spongebob,0
"Happy birthday, Grandma.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.",not spongebob,0
Sorry. No check. But I've got this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!",not spongebob,0
"I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws. And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.",not spongebob,0
"One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.",not spongebob,0
"So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....",not spongebob,0
Aaarrrrr!,not spongebob,0
"And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.",not spongebob,0
I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.,not spongebob,0
"Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson.",not spongebob,0
"Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...",not spongebob,0
Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, uh, Grandpa...",not spongebob,0
"And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress. Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.",not spongebob,0
"For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.,spongebob,1
"Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.",not spongebob,0
We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate.",not spongebob,0
Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!,spongebob,1
"But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!",not spongebob,0
"Way to go, fellars.",not spongebob,0
Hee-ar!,not spongebob,0
He's comin'!,not spongebob,0
"Har, har, har!",not spongebob,0
"Hide me, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Eugene, me boy! Aye, it's good to see you and yer ship after so many moons! Just beginin' to think you was lyin' to yer old granddad!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?",not spongebob,0
Hm...this might be a pirate crew. But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers.,not spongebob,0
Um...,spongebob,1
"Har, har, har! I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy! You look like a fine pirate crew.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Now, let's see what this rusty old pelican can do! Let's sail!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.",spongebob,1
"Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.",not spongebob,0
Aye.,not spongebob,0
"I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!",not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
"There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.",not spongebob,0
What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack!",not spongebob,0
Grrrrrr....,not spongebob,0
"Aye, look at the size of that beast.",not spongebob,0
"Not to worry, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
Aha! That's the stuff!,not spongebob,0
"Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?",not spongebob,0
Whah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing. Look!",not spongebob,0
"Har, har, har, har! That's me boy!",not spongebob,0
Clear!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Woo-hoo!,spongebob,1
"Sounds like we got a prize.  Ready, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad. Check the... Granddad?",not spongebob,0
Ahoy! Trouble aproachin' quick! Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow! Man your battle stations!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.",not spongebob,0
"What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?! Move!",not spongebob,0
"What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?",not spongebob,0
Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen! A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, so depulsive.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. It must be destroyed! Here, see for yourself.",not spongebob,0
"Go get it, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!,not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel?",not spongebob,0
Dad!,not spongebob,0
"That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!",not spongebob,0
Open up!,not spongebob,0
"Prepare to meet yer maker, sea witch.",not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
What are ya doin'?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded.",not spongebob,0
What is this?!,not spongebob,0
I can explain.,not spongebob,0
Dad! Dad!,not spongebob,0
Now it's even more angry!,not spongebob,0
Don't worry! I have it under control!,not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!,not spongebob,0
What's with the lame outfit?,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, never mind that!  Just go home.",not spongebob,0
I bet you're wondering about that.,not spongebob,0
"Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!",not spongebob,0
Do you mind?,not spongebob,0
What kinda ship are you runnin' here?,not spongebob,0
Just a second.,not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!,not spongebob,0
"Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.",not spongebob,0
"I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stickier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?",not spongebob,0
"Of course I do, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
"Well, then, say it!",not spongebob,0
"It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!  And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie!  This crew is a lie!  Even the ship is a lie!  All of it! All a lie!",not spongebob,0
Krabby Patties: $2.00. Krusty Combo: $3.99! Coral Bits: $1.95?!,not spongebob,0
"You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.",not spongebob,0
"Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's real piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!",not spongebob,0

"Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?",not spongebob,0

No.,not spongebob,0
Good! 'Cause we've got customers!,spongebob,1

Don't hold back.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!",spongebob,1

But I thought you liked the night shift.,not spongebob,0
You're right!  FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB!  AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh!  Piece of cake.,spongebob,1
So you're not afraid?,not spongebob,0
"Pfft, nah.",spongebob,1
"Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know.",not spongebob,0
What? What do I know?,spongebob,1
You don't remember? It was all over the news.,not spongebob,0
"Tell me, tell me!",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you.",not spongebob,0
"What happened, what happened, what happened!?",spongebob,1
You mean you've never heard the story of the  Hash-Slinging Slasher?,not spongebob,0
The Slash-Bringing Hasher?,spongebob,1
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!,not spongebob,0
"The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging,  The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.",spongebob,1
"Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha--- because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!",not spongebob,0
Tell me the story!,spongebob,1
"Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.",not spongebob,0
He forgot the secret sauce?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
He didn't wash his hands?,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Irregular portions?,spongebob,1
No!! He cut off his own hand by mistake!,not spongebob,0
"You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or...",spongebob,1
Except he wasn't a sponge.,not spongebob,0
So?,spongebob,1
So it didn't grow back!,not spongebob,0
"OH, NO!!!",spongebob,1
"And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?",not spongebob,0
Tuesday.,spongebob,1
"Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.",not spongebob,0
But tonight's Tuesday night!,spongebob,1
Then he'll be coming.,not spongebob,0
How will we know?,spongebob,1
There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First: the lights will flicker on and off. Next...,not spongebob,0
"Dude, can I have some ketchup?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, here you go.  Next: the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally: the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...",not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
He opens the door...  ...he slowly approaches the counter!  And you know what he does next?,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You really want to know?,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Are you sure you want to know?,not spongebob,0
"WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!",spongebob,1
"He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SPONGEBOB, I WAS JOKING!!",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
It's not true! None of it's true!,not spongebob,0
It's not?,spongebob,1
Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.,not spongebob,0
Ohhhhh...,spongebob,1
"Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.",spongebob,1
Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Three A.M.!",not spongebob,0
"Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
"And the lights will flicker on and off, just like the story. I get it.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?",spongebob,1
"I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Nice try, what?",not spongebob,0
"The phone will ring and there will be no one there.  Oh, you crack me up.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  ...and the walls will ooze green slime?!?!  Oh, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?",not spongebob,0
I didn't know the buses ran this late.,spongebob,1
They don't!,not spongebob,0
"Well, they're dropping someone off.",spongebob,1
"The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...",not spongebob,0
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!,spongebob,1
At last you understand! We're doomed!,not spongebob,0
"No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One: I hate you. And two: how can that be me when I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!?",not spongebob,0
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!!!!,not spongebob,0
He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!,spongebob,1
"Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula.  I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.",not spongebob,0
Do you have references?,spongebob,1
"Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?",not spongebob,0
Nosferatu!,not spongebob,0
"♪Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--♪  Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'.  Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me!",not spongebob,0
"That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.",not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
"That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!",not spongebob,0
Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?,not spongebob,0
What's happening to me?!,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I could—",not spongebob,0
I  need  food.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--",not spongebob,0
...refrigerator.,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.",not spongebob,0
So did I.,not spongebob,0
"You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.",not spongebob,0
It means I need food!,not spongebob,0

"Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you're just gonna have to go buy some.",not spongebob,0
"Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, what's that green stuff in your pocket?",not spongebob,0
Eh? Where?,not spongebob,0
There!,not spongebob,0
Me money?,not spongebob,0
I'll just have to eat this.,not spongebob,0
"No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh?",not spongebob,0
Must protect garden.  Only thing that makes life worth living.,not spongebob,0
"Hehehehehe! Peanuts!  What the...  These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables!",not spongebob,0
"Who's there? I'm warning you. I have a blunt instrument here, and I'm not afraid to use it.  There you are, sucker!",not spongebob,0
"Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff!  Jackpot.  Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl.  Don't worry, Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles!  Bottom feeders.  Pearl! I brought you some--  ...cereal.",not spongebob,0
"More, Daddy, More!",not spongebob,0
"There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again!",not spongebob,0
"Which way did you say the kidnapper ran, Miss, uh, Mrs., uh, Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mrs.  So which way did you say he went?",not spongebob,0
I said he went that way.,not spongebob,0
Anything else?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Got it. Johnson.  Well, looks like whoever it was is gone now, ma'am. Enjoy the rest of the evening.  I tell ya, these calls are getting more and more weird. I mean, what kind of nutcase would want to break into someone's vegetable garden at this time of night?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I doubt he's gonna turn up anywhere near here again tonight. What do you say we go check out that new 24-hour taser emporium you were talking about?",not spongebob,0
"Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!  Food.  Not food.  Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge.  Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. I needed to lose a little weight anyway.",not spongebob,0
"And that's what I told him. I said, If you're not gonna bring an extra set of batteries, then why even carry a--  Hey mister! What's with the sack?",not spongebob,0
S-sack?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sack. That big giant sack thing you're carrying on your back, that sack.",not spongebob,0
"It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be Santy Claws for the holidays.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you have a safe night now.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks again, officer!",not spongebob,0
Be seeing you in a couple months.  Happy Holidays.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya!",not spongebob,0
More!,not spongebob,0
I was afraid you were gonna say that.,not spongebob,0
I wasn't stealing food!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See",not spongebob,0
"Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.",spongebob,1
"G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.",not spongebob,0
"Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.",not spongebob,0
But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.,spongebob,1
I don't care. I'm calling the police.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait, you can't.",not spongebob,0
Oh? And why is that?,not spongebob,0
"Because if you do, I'll fire ya.  No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Hello, police?",not spongebob,0
Hold it! I'll... I'll...,not spongebob,0
You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?,not spongebob,0
I didn't even know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.,spongebob,1
Neither did I.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.",spongebob,1
"It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
Pearl? What happened?,spongebob,1
"She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?",spongebob,1
"Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.",not spongebob,0
You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.,spongebob,1
"Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, hurry it up!",not spongebob,0
"Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.",spongebob,1
You've been saying that for the last--,not spongebob,0
"Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!",not spongebob,0
"Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?",not spongebob,0
"It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.",spongebob,1
Eh?,not spongebob,0
"Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?",spongebob,1
Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.,not spongebob,0
You have a secret?,spongebob,1
"Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles.",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir. And who will be in charge while you're gone.",spongebob,1
"Eh,  well, not Squidward.  No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.,not spongebob,0
I'm... in charge?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir.",spongebob,1
What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes,not spongebob,0
"Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?",spongebob,1
Krabs is gone?,not spongebob,0
Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.,spongebob,1

Wake me up when I care.,not spongebob,0
Do you care now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's just that I'm in charge and...",spongebob,1
And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?,not spongebob,0
Regulary scheduled nap?,spongebob,1
This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.,not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I, um...",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"Order up, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties.",spongebob,1
So do it when you're done.,not spongebob,0
And unclog the sink.,spongebob,1
