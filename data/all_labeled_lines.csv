We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!,not spongebob,0
Gal Pals! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a Krabby Patty!  Perfect.",not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
The engine needed greasing.,not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Mrs. Puff!  Your boat and trailer just got hitched!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?",not spongebob,0
"This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back.",not spongebob,0
Boo! Who likes eggs?,spongebob,1
"Not now, SpongeBob.  Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary.",spongebob,1
Keep working on it.,not spongebob,0
Here comes our newest member!,not spongebob,0
Gal Pals! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me get your bag.",not spongebob,0
"tents, sleeping bags, sporting equipment, lanterns, pillows, extra blankets, umbrellas, food, a grill, swimwear, and suitcases with extra clothing. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out through all those camping supplies just as the trailer door closed.]",not spongebob,0
Nice and cozy.,spongebob,1
"♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout Gal Pals right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?",not spongebob,0
"Where am I?  Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets.  Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do?  Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive!  Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut.  I've got a lucky peanut!",spongebob,1
Here we are.,not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh, looks like we lost something.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen!",not spongebob,0
"Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend.",not spongebob,0
She must be psychic.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it!  All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!",not spongebob,0
"Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger.  Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, nature always provides.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, where's the newbie?",not spongebob,0
"Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right.",not spongebob,0
"I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes!  Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing.  Hello?  Shell-lo?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?",spongebob,1
"Uh, well, there are a lot of trees.",not spongebob,0
"Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees.  Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars.  Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees...",spongebob,1
"Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Gal Pals,  it's time to initiate our newest member.",not spongebob,0
You are now a Gal Pal.,not spongebob,0
That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?,not spongebob,0
Why would we do that?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, we like you.",not spongebob,0
We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I—,not spongebob,0
Puff! Shh.,not spongebob,0
Who's Slippery Giveth?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night.",not spongebob,0
We don't even remember what the fight was about.,not spongebob,0
It sure was a humdinger of an argument!,not spongebob,0
She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals.,not spongebob,0
Then she just ran off into these woods!,not spongebob,0
"Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge.",not spongebob,0
That's her pendant you're wearing.,not spongebob,0
"Flibberty Gibbet?!  Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?!  Thanks, gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me.",not spongebob,0
Sure you did.,not spongebob,0
You should have seen your face.,not spongebob,0
We got you good!,not spongebob,0
"Mm, Gal Pals.",not spongebob,0
What was that?,not spongebob,0
"'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank.",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.,not spongebob,0
She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.,not spongebob,0
And she did run off into these woods.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, that was all the parts!",not spongebob,0
"Quick, let's hide in the cabin!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right, SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!",not spongebob,0
"There's another tree.  And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works.  Tree, tree, tree, tree.",spongebob,1
"So, SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back.  We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom!  Ooh, what am I saying?",not spongebob,0
Let's scale it down a smidge.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up.",not spongebob,0
"You coming, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark.",not spongebob,0
"Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet!,not spongebob,0
"It's her! Oh, s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!",not spongebob,0
"I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!",not spongebob,0
Let's go!,not spongebob,0
Rawr! Hmm?,spongebob,1
"No, no! SpongeBob! Don't go in!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello.",spongebob,1
"Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Gal Pals.,not spongebob,0
"Wow!  Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it.  Wow!  I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.,not spongebob,0
"Did someone say my name?  Hi, gals!",not spongebob,0
Flibberty Gibbet!,not spongebob,0
I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!",spongebob,1
Gal Pals!,not spongebob,0
Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny.  What the...?!  What in Neptune's knickers is this?!,not spongebob,0
"Where's the dude in the boat, man? Where's the dude in the boat?!",not spongebob,0
"Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward.  Well, he's at his post right over the...  Where's me cashier?!  SpongeBob! Where in Poseidon's pantyhose is that sorry excuse for a cashier?!",not spongebob,0
Sorry excuse for a cash-? Ooh! You mean Squidward.,spongebob,1
Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!,not spongebob,0
He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring...  ...complete privacy.,spongebob,1
"Ooh. He requires, privacy does he?  What's all the ruckus?!  Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible!  Are you hurt?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. Thank you for ask-",not spongebob,0
"I wasn't talking to you!  Don't worry, papa's here.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs?  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle!",not spongebob,0
I didn't even know you had ankles.,not spongebob,0
"As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.",not spongebob,0
Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...,not spongebob,0
"It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.",spongebob,1
"Substantial fines?!  You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know.",not spongebob,0
Really? Maybe I should give them a call.,not spongebob,0
"Now now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid!",not spongebob,0
"First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker,  for I am certified.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no no no, don't touch me!  SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure.",spongebob,1
"Ow!  Get away from me!  Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!",not spongebob,0
Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask.,not spongebob,0
Hmm? Anything?,not spongebob,0
"Now if you want anything, just ask.",not spongebob,0
I could sure use a pillow.,not spongebob,0
And one more for my foot.,not spongebob,0
"Well, sure thing.  Okay, if that's all, I'll just get back to me--",not spongebob,0
Fluff it.,not spongebob,0
What did you say?,not spongebob,0
"I said, fluff it.",not spongebob,0
"Fluff my pillow, I'll fluff your pillow.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, I said, uh, will there be anything else, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"No thanks. That should do it.  Oh, Krabsy!",not spongebob,0
What can I do for you?,not spongebob,0
Just one more thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take over for me today.,not spongebob,0
What!? No!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's too bad. It looks like my twisted ankle might become a 'permanent injury.'",not spongebob,0
"Well, that would be an even bigger fine. You just sit back down and relax. We don't want you being injured any further.  That was close. Well, at least the Krusty Krab isn't very busy today.  Of course.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence?  Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?",spongebob,1
It's what criminals wear to bed. Don't worry about that. We don't need to bother those nice folks over at the OWS. We can do our own investigation.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent.",spongebob,1
"Well, no, not exactly, what I mean is...  I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something, and I want you to investigate.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs...",spongebob,1
Shhhh.  You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.,not spongebob,0
"Can do, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help.  Okay, you stand here...  Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun.  And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward.  Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, do what again?  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"Darn, one more time.",spongebob,1
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Krabsy, after tea, I think a full tentacle massage would be an order.",not spongebob,0
I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft...,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....",not spongebob,0
"I'll go get the massage oil now.  Boy, ya got anything?",not spongebob,0
"Not yet, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
I'm waiting!,not spongebob,0
Coming!,not spongebob,0
This just isn't adding up.,spongebob,1
Pudding?,not spongebob,0
"We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you.",spongebob,1
"Um, hello? Anybody here?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, for the love of peat moss.",not spongebob,0
"Anybody at all? Hmm, maybe they're on their lunch bre--",not spongebob,0
"Um, aren't you gonna wash your......",not spongebob,0
How long do I have to keep this up?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's gonna be a long, slow recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles.",not spongebob,0
Office Workers Safety Department. I'm here to investigate the accident.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS?!",not spongebob,0
"He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?",spongebob,1
"Uh, breakfast, green, Finland.",not spongebob,0
"Well I, for one, plan to give him my full cooperation.  Anything I can do, inspector?",not spongebob,0
"So, this is where the accident occurred. Can anyone tell me what happened?",not spongebob,0
"I'll be glad to...  I mean, I can re-live the whole tragic episode, if I must.  It was just another day at the Krusty Krab. I was at the register, giving it a nice shining between orders, when something caught my eye; a patty bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. I wasn't about to stand idly by and allow a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and vitamins. I must replace it with a proper bun!, I said. I dashed into action.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir.",not spongebob,0
What a diligent and charming individual.,not spongebob,0
"That's when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help.  Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I see. As you know, certain penalties are involved...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no...",not spongebob,0
One... Dollar.,not spongebob,0
"No! Why?! Why, why?! Huh?  What's this? Hold on a second. Me video surveillance camera!",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"I forgot. I, uh, um, borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here.  You... f-f-f-f-f-faker! Not to mention you were sleeping on the job!",not spongebob,0
What are you going to do to me?,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna make you pay.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, day!  Ow!  I stubbed my toe!  I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe!  D'oh, that was my favorite shirt.",spongebob,1
"And that was Aja by Eely Dan. Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, Sad Song.",not spongebob,0
That's a sad song!,spongebob,1
"That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me, I get to work with him all day.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, guess what?  Yeah, I'll come back later.",not spongebob,0
"He was a good little Krabby Patty.  I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I----I came to love him!  It just isn't fair!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!",not spongebob,0
But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—,spongebob,1
Krabby Patty nothing!  Krabby Patty nothing!  What now?,not spongebob,0
You yelled at me! You yelled at me!!!,spongebob,1
"All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.",not spongebob,0
And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.,spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
I have no idea.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.",spongebob,1
Au contraire.,not spongebob,0
What's this?,spongebob,1
It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.,not spongebob,0
Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.,spongebob,1
Thousands of tears later...,not spongebob,0
"Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore.",spongebob,1
"Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.",not spongebob,0
Excuse me a minute.,spongebob,1
Star... residence. Patrick speaking.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?",not spongebob,0
"No, I'm still at work.",spongebob,1
How can I help you?,not spongebob,0
Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?,spongebob,1
"Well, of course you can.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, great, thanks, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah.  Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, talk to you later.",not spongebob,0
"All right, see ya.  Okay, it's a bet.",spongebob,1
"Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to...  Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.",not spongebob,0
"Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?",spongebob,1
"Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth.  No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"There's a first time for everything.  Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible.",not spongebob,0
I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry.  I can do this!,spongebob,1
"Do what?  Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob.  Isn't that beautiful?",not spongebob,0
I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.,spongebob,1
"Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?",not spongebob,0
It's...,spongebob,1
Is that a tear I see?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, sunset's over.  Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.",spongebob,1
"Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.",not spongebob,0
Aww. He looks like an angel.,spongebob,1
That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.,not spongebob,0
Yeah...  No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.",not spongebob,0
"Mother, father?",spongebob,1
"Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.",not spongebob,0
"Ohh...  My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
No problem.,not spongebob,0
Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News. Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, let's turn it up.",not spongebob,0
Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"However, he did get down.",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,spongebob,1
"Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no.",spongebob,1
"And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans.",not spongebob,0
"What, what, what?",spongebob,1
They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—,not spongebob,0
"Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?!",spongebob,1
Fine!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, son, I'm late for work.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Dad.",not spongebob,0
I guess I can stay for a few throws.,not spongebob,0
"I love you, Dad.",not spongebob,0
"I love you, son.",not spongebob,0
You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.,spongebob,1
"Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob!  I'm gonna watch it all night!",not spongebob,0
"It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns.  Oh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What would you say to a little music?,not spongebob,0
I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments.,spongebob,1
Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting.,not spongebob,0
"You said something, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I just said, Relax and enjoy the song.",not spongebob,0
"That's a really sad song, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"You're not gonna cry though, are you?",not spongebob,0
"No.  Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed.",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward?",spongebob,1
How about a bedtime story?,not spongebob,0
"Now you're talking!  Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Umm...  How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?,not spongebob,0
That sounds like a very sad story.,spongebob,1
"Oh, very sad. Umm... There once was a little angler  who was, uh, little and sad.  One day the little sad angler was walking through the park.",not spongebob,0
Walking...,spongebob,1
"But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry.  He cried and he cried. And he cried even more.  And he kept crying...  ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.",not spongebob,0
"I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel-- Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on!  ...four, three, two, one!  Midnight!  Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the...",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what a great show.",not spongebob,0
"Well, at least we're still together, little ones.",not spongebob,0
"More popcorn, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No, no. No, no. Please.",not spongebob,0
"Don't be shy now. I made extra.  That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.",spongebob,1
"There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for 2 whole days.",spongebob,1
2 whole days?!?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!",spongebob,1
Tejas!,not spongebob,0
"She won't be back for 1 more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds!",spongebob,1
"Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here.",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
"I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.",spongebob,1
Is Sandy the one I call Mom?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome!",spongebob,1
Wa-hey!,not spongebob,0
"Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be in about...  ...Whoo! Right now!  ♪ Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya! ♪",spongebob,1
NO!  NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SING!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy.",not spongebob,0
"That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy!  First cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...",spongebob,1
"Wow, guys! You two, uh...  Really know how to, uhhh...  throw a party...",not spongebob,0
I knew it! You have been itching to see us!,spongebob,1
"Well, something's making my skin crawl.",not spongebob,0
Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return.,spongebob,1
This is gonna taste so good again.,not spongebob,0
"Dig in, Sandy!  Uh...",spongebob,1
"Looks... tasty, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Are you okay, Sandy?",spongebob,1
I'm fine. My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air.,not spongebob,0
"Uh... hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya a little somethin' somethin'.",spongebob,1
"Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.",not spongebob,0
Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?,spongebob,1
"Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?",spongebob,1
"Rashy sore! I mean, sure!",not spongebob,0
Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?,spongebob,1
"Creepin' critters! Feels like somethin's bitin' me.  I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight!  Hi...yah!  I'll get ya!  SpongeBob, my suitcase! Hurry!  I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea.",not spongebob,0
What's a flea?,spongebob,1
A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'.,not spongebob,0
"Ahahaha, he tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  OWWWW!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"No, but you can use this one right quick.",not spongebob,0
"Ow! Ah, ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah!  Hahaha, connect the dots!  I drawed a horsey!  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?",not spongebob,0
"'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites ya, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.",not spongebob,0
"I've been bit by a vampire flea!  Noooooo! I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening!! Ah, ah!!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick,  there ain't no such thing as vampires.",not spongebob,0
"Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me! Yagh!!!",not spongebob,0
Aah! Gimme that!  Phew!,not spongebob,0
"Nyahh! Oh. Sandy, please. Hellllp meeeee!",spongebob,1
I need this!,not spongebob,0
I need it more.,spongebob,1
Eee!,not spongebob,0
"Yah!  Enough! I will not take this anymore!  Whatcha gonna do now, punks?  Looky, it worked! Phew. I'm glad that's over.",not spongebob,0
"Um, is that what over looks like?",spongebob,1
Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad!  Run!,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
Wah!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!,spongebob,1
Hey!  Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla!  Run again!,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0

"Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, good to see ya.",not spongebob,0
Raah!  Help! Help! Help!,not spongebob,0
"Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.",not spongebob,0
Back off!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay?",spongebob,1
"Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!",not spongebob,0
"It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas and trouble and pain and itching... and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. Soooooo much pain! So much pain.  And as for you. If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.",not spongebob,0
Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did!,spongebob,1
You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship!,not spongebob,0
Stop smudging my helmet!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"WOULD YOU TWO MEN STOP YELLING AT EACH OTHER!!!  WHAT DOES THAT PROVE!!?? IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS, WE GOTTA WORK TOGETHER!",not spongebob,0
"You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ahhhh...  Ahhhhhhhh. Much better.  Whoa!",not spongebob,0
"I do not play games!  Quick! Get in the tree house, it's the only safe place left!  We should be protected here.  Hold on!",not spongebob,0
Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! That's it! Water!,not spongebob,0
Water!,not spongebob,0
"It sure is good to have you back, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!",spongebob,1
"Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged.",spongebob,1
"Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts?  Hey, rain! You better stop that!",not spongebob,0
AAAAAAHHH!!!!!,not spongebob,0
"If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...,spongebob,1
Don't care.,not spongebob,0
"I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain!  Hey,   that gives me an idea.",spongebob,1
What follows is a brief construction montage.,not spongebob,0
We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.,not spongebob,0
"Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!",spongebob,1
"I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!",not spongebob,0
But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.,not spongebob,0
"I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...",not spongebob,0
Join us on the back nine?,not spongebob,0
Just don't let it happen again! Or else.,not spongebob,0
"Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man.",spongebob,1
Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!,not spongebob,0
"Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't want to upset Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Can't wait to lose, huh?  NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and-",spongebob,1
Nice shot.,not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,spongebob,1
Moving my ball.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.",spongebob,1
Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?,not spongebob,0
Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.,not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick, this is just a game.",spongebob,1
"Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.",not spongebob,0
I think you're missing the point.,spongebob,1
"Speaking of m-m-MISSING!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  YES! See if you can top that!",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey.  A pressure-packed shot to be sure.",not spongebob,0
Aw.,not spongebob,0
"Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.",not spongebob,0
"Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.",spongebob,1
Whatever.  AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!,not spongebob,0
"All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.",spongebob,1
Watch out for the water hazard.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.",spongebob,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,not spongebob,0
Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you.  Oops.,spongebob,1
Show-off. I can do that.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, where did our balls go?!",spongebob,1
"Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.",spongebob,1
"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.",not spongebob,0
But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!,spongebob,1
Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!,not spongebob,0
"Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?",spongebob,1
"Okay, okay!",not spongebob,0
Now where is that darn ball?,spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, have you seen my ball?",spongebob,1
Was it a red one?,not spongebob,0
M-hmm.,spongebob,1
It might have been in the kelp salad.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you ate my ball?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, I'll get it.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, no.",spongebob,1
No?,not spongebob,0
"I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?",spongebob,1
I don't know. Got to be around here somewhere.,not spongebob,0
There it is!,spongebob,1
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Play it where it lies.,spongebob,1
Hole in one! Top that!,not spongebob,0
I could do that blindfolded.,spongebob,1
Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!,not spongebob,0
Aha!,spongebob,1
"Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again.",not spongebob,0
Patrick...,spongebob,1
Stop peeking! Hotter.  Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick...!",spongebob,1
AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!,not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,spongebob,1
I was just freshening up. But these fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold! Cold!,not spongebob,0
Would you please get back in the game?,spongebob,1
But I wanted to try his loofah.,not spongebob,0
"Those balls have got to be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.",not spongebob,0
Play it where it lies?,spongebob,1
Play it where it lies.,not spongebob,0
But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?,spongebob,1
"All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you're good to go.",spongebob,1
Fore!  It's all yours.,not spongebob,0
This one's for all the marbles.,spongebob,1
But I thought we weren't betting.,not spongebob,0
"No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game.",spongebob,1
What's going on here?,not spongebob,0
Hole in one!,not spongebob,0
Good morning.,spongebob,1
Sorry we woke you.,not spongebob,0
Wha-What?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?",spongebob,1
"Good game, pal.",not spongebob,0
Rematch next Saturday?,spongebob,1
"Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"This is how to live, isn't it my friend?",spongebob,1
You said it buddy.,not spongebob,0
He's amazing!,not spongebob,0
I'll say!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Who is that guy?,not spongebob,0
That's Larry the Lobster. He's like living large!,not spongebob,0
What's your secret Larry?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you've gotta take risks.  Live on the edge.",not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"And you can't... Uh... You can't...  And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless,  weak,  afraid of their own shadows.  Pathetic!",not spongebob,0
"Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?",not spongebob,0
I'll tell you how: by living each day as if it were their last!,not spongebob,0
How do we do that?,not spongebob,0
"By living like me, Larry.",not spongebob,0
But what's that have...,not spongebob,0
"By living, like Larry.",not spongebob,0
"Living, like Larry.",not spongebob,0
Living like Larry!,not spongebob,0
Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!,not spongebob,0
What's that Pat?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...LIVIN' LIKE LARRY!  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome!,not spongebob,0
"Hey Patrick, where you going?",spongebob,1
To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet!,not spongebob,0
I don't know about this Patrick.,spongebob,1
"You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it!",not spongebob,0
Livin' Like Larry,not spongebob,0
De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry.,spongebob,1
Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, where are we going?",spongebob,1
Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys.,not spongebob,0
"I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger...",spongebob,1
Here's to living like Larry!,not spongebob,0
"Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. Living like Larry doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.",spongebob,1
"Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.",spongebob,1
I see. And that's your final word on the subject?,not spongebob,0
Mmm-hmm.,spongebob,1
I feel sorry for you.,not spongebob,0
I wonder how Patrick's doing with his living like Larry thing.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!,not spongebob,0
"Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?",spongebob,1
Uh-uh.,not spongebob,0
Don't make us come in there kid!,not spongebob,0
"Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen.",spongebob,1
What the?,not spongebob,0
"I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of living in the moment are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did?",spongebob,1
Sure pal. Sure.,not spongebob,0
"By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky?",spongebob,1
He knocked over our motorcycles!,not spongebob,0
"So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry!",spongebob,1
Are you sure about this SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?",spongebob,1
"I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry!",spongebob,1
"Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!",not spongebob,0
Prepare for countdown!,spongebob,1
"I'm proud of them.  Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds!  Wait, don't do it! Stop!",not spongebob,0
3-2-1 Lift off.,spongebob,1
Drat!,not spongebob,0
Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!!,spongebob,1
"Whoooooa!!!  Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look!",not spongebob,0
Uh oh!,not spongebob,0
AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!,not spongebob,0
"What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more.  What would Larry do?",spongebob,1
What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do!  Come here! Come here I said! Hey!,not spongebob,0
"One monster Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
"Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!,spongebob,1
"Uh, One monster Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
Monster Krabby Patty?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear Neptune.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
"We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?",spongebob,1
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on.,not spongebob,0
"Well, we better get back to work.",not spongebob,0
Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!,spongebob,1
Use another spatula'r.,not spongebob,0
"WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming, Spat!",spongebob,1
"Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.",spongebob,1
"flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula.]",not spongebob,0
"There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.",not spongebob,0
Go home. Get some rest. We'll try to do everything we can.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Doctor.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who's searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part.",not spongebob,0
Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!,spongebob,1
Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.,spongebob,1
I would give serious consideration to...  a replacement spatula.,not spongebob,0
OW!,spongebob,1
"Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.",not spongebob,0
I'm sorry.,spongebob,1
"Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.",not spongebob,0
"I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?",spongebob,1
Umm...  ...no.,not spongebob,0
How about now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?,spongebob,1
"Everything, huh?  Nice outfit.",not spongebob,0
"Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking?  Ooh, breezy today.",spongebob,1
"Nice outfit, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.",spongebob,1
What's all the lallygagging about?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
This better be good.,not spongebob,0
"Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.",spongebob,1
"Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?",not spongebob,0
"All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma.",spongebob,1
"Well, what can it do?",not spongebob,0
Can it make me famous?,not spongebob,0
Anything you want and more.,spongebob,1
"Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.",spongebob,1
What? Are you going against your commanding officer?,not spongebob,0
"No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.",spongebob,1
"With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact...",spongebob,1
Le Spatula 3000 at your service!,not spongebob,0
"Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job.",spongebob,1
"Uh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?",spongebob,1
"I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!",not spongebob,0
"But, but, I thought we were friends.",spongebob,1
"Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class.  Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook!",not spongebob,0
"Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something.",spongebob,1
"How's that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon.",not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
"Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!",not spongebob,0
"I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!",spongebob,1
I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.",spongebob,1
"Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers.",not spongebob,0
Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...",not spongebob,0
I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone!,spongebob,1
"Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm so sorry.",spongebob,1
"Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary.",not spongebob,0
"Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?!",spongebob,1
&#160;: All that glitters is not gold.,spongebob,1
"Goodbye, best friend!",spongebob,1
"I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.",spongebob,1
One monster Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy.  See you later, Gare.  Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun… together. Okay… …Love you, Gare-bear. Bye.",spongebob,1
"Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru-  Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone.  Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.",not spongebob,0
"Eh?  Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price.  SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay.  Too distraught to even answer the phone.,spongebob,1
"Hello. You've reached SpongeBob and… C'mon Gary.  Meow.  Gary.  The two of us are having too much fun together to answer the phone right now. so, leave the massage and will call you right back. Not as long as we take a break and have fun… together!",not spongebob,0
"My outgoing message is a lie.  Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up…",spongebob,1
"Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon.",spongebob,1
"Well, well, well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.",spongebob,1
"Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.",not spongebob,0
"Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.",not spongebob,0
"You're the best, Mr. Krabs!  Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
"Wow, Dad, is it really mine to keep?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely.  And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.",not spongebob,0
"Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.",spongebob,1
"Hey, thanks, Dad.",not spongebob,0
They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!,spongebob,1
You wish to have one of my rare and extremely dangerous… huh?,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, this is the one.",spongebob,1
"Beware, boy, this is no ordinary pet!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!",spongebob,1
You must to understand. These pets can be very unstable. especially around other pets!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye.",spongebob,1
Why bother? They never listen.,not spongebob,0
"Sheriff, I've caught the bank robber.  There's your culprit right here. Now cuff him.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I've brought you a surprise.  Your very own play pal.  His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back.",spongebob,1
"Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here, you.  There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas.",spongebob,1
"Done!  Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot!  Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends.  Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond.  Great, now my enchiladas are cold.",spongebob,1
"Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?!  Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight.  I hope you're happy now.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend.  Aww, look at you two so cute together.",spongebob,1
Meooooooow.,not spongebob,0
"I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.",spongebob,1
"Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Gary! Shame on you!  Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless.  See? There he is, fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please?  Good night.",spongebob,1

Phew.  Meow!,not spongebob,0
Oooow! Mah!,not spongebob,0
Mah!,not spongebob,0
"Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along!  Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh, well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. Whoa!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right, Gary, you have left me no choice!",spongebob,1
"Gary!  You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary!  Bad! Bad! Bad boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad!  I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh, hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy?  What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt.",spongebob,1
MEOW!,not spongebob,0
This is exactly what I was talking about--,spongebob,1
"Fluffy! Fluffy, wait!  Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?",spongebob,1
"Ah, this is more like it. From now on, I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home.",spongebob,1
What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out.",spongebob,1
"Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so?  Serve ‘em up, snail!",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!,spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"It's part two of the two-part special, The Case of the Curious Cliff Hanger. Well, I've rearranged the living room for optimal TV viewing.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
The popcorn's a-popping.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"And the soda's on ice. All that's left is to set the VCR to record  so I can relive the magic over and over forever.  Hmm, but which tape to use? Don't have any blank ones left. Hmm.  Oh, here we go. Who needs a tape of their own birth, anyway?  Yoop, done!  Now it's just one quick shift at the Krusty Krab, and I'll be back for the evening's entertainment.",spongebob,1
"Normally I like working, but today is moving  so slowly.",spongebob,1
"Oh, at this rate I'm never gonna see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.",spongebob,1
Hmm?,spongebob,1
"We'll help you get through the day, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
And tonight we'll conquer evil!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, you guys always make me feel better.  Hmm?",spongebob,1
One Shift Later...,not spongebob,0
"All right, bye, Squidward! Bye, Mr. Krabs!  See you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob. My boat has a flat tire. Could you help me change it?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, well,  I gotta get home for Mermaid Man, but—but sure, I guess I have a little time.",spongebob,1
"Oh, good. Let me know when you're done.",not spongebob,0
"Luckily, I brought all my tools.  Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer— Whoa!  Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!",spongebob,1
Gotta get that old tire off. And...  Yes? No. Maybe if I try...,spongebob,1
Hmm. Ah-ha!,spongebob,1
"Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go.",spongebob,1
"Thanks again, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
"Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace.  Ah, home sweet pineapple!",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy! You got a minute?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, not really, but—",spongebob,1
"I double-parked my rock, and it got towed.  Could you help me get it back?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. Mermaid Man is on soon.",spongebob,1
You'se guys can take a look around on your owns.,not spongebob,0
"They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, buddy. I'll know it when I feel it. Oh, this might be it! Give me a hand!",not spongebob,0
"Ow! No, this isn't it. Oh, ooh, this one might be it!",not spongebob,0
"Ouch! No, this isn't it either. Ow! No. Ow! No.  No.  No.",not spongebob,0
This is it. This is my rock!,not spongebob,0
Congratulations. Now there's a little matter of the fee.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, talk to him.",not spongebob,0
Here you go.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob! See you at home for Mermaid Man! Whoo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. I could really use your help.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause Mermaid Man is on and it's the lost episode—",spongebob,1
"Oh, it won't take more than a minute.",not spongebob,0
My laser acorn experiment blasted a nut-sized hole in my dome. Could you stick your finger here while I go get my fix-it-up kit?,not spongebob,0
I don't really have a lot of time to—,spongebob,1
"Thanks, be right back!",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I can't wait to see that long lost Mermaid Man episode tonight.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, for sure. No real fan would miss it. Not for the world.",not spongebob,0
"All righty, SpongeBob. I'm ready to—What?",not spongebob,0
That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna—,spongebob,1
"Boy-o, you gotta help me sort me loose change!",not spongebob,0
But Mermaid Man.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it!  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.,spongebob,1
"Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, Mermaid Man!  Oh.  Where'd I put my keys?  Did I leave them on the table again?  No, my tape!  My soda!  My popcorn!  My Mermaid Man!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, SpongeBob. Why all the waterworks?",not spongebob,0
I was so busy helping everyone that I missed Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!,spongebob,1
they took his kindness for granted and inexplicably ruined his chances of seeing the episode he's been looking forward to watching.],not spongebob,0
"All right, listen up. SpongeBob has helped every single one of us dozens of times over. But we ain't been very helpful to him today.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I was a lousy friend.",not spongebob,0
"Now, we may have taken advantage of his kindness, but I got a plan to make things right.",not spongebob,0
The Next Day...,not spongebob,0
Play…,spongebob,1
"Hey there, SpongeBob. Feeling any better?",not spongebob,0
"Aww,  why don't you come with me? I have a little surprise for you.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not really in the mood, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Aww, quit acting like a calf with colic.  Come on, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?",spongebob,1
Don't worry about that. Just sit right here and enjoy the play.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay.",spongebob,1
"Welcome, ladies and morons! It's time for the exciting conclusion to... The Case of the Curious Cliffhanger!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Whoa!,spongebob,1

"What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.",spongebob,1
"Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well.",not spongebob,0
Yes?!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?",spongebob,1
So what?,not spongebob,0
How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?,spongebob,1
I hear you crying all the time.,not spongebob,0
"Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.",spongebob,1
"Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please.  Okay... can someone else take my order?",not spongebob,0
I'll wait.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.",spongebob,1
Really? Do you think you can?,not spongebob,0
No problem.,spongebob,1
"Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay.",not spongebob,0
"You love music, right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Mmm hmm.,not spongebob,0
Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!,spongebob,1
"Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!",not spongebob,0
See? Your happiest memory is forming!,spongebob,1
Oops. That was a sour note.,spongebob,1
This is not my happiest memory...,not spongebob,0
Why are we at the Art Museum?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!",spongebob,1
Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?,not spongebob,0
"Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece!",not spongebob,0
Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!,spongebob,1
Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!,not spongebob,0
Your happiest memory?,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece,not spongebob,0
Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!,not spongebob,0
Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light...  of my flamethrower!,not spongebob,0
And now he's melted it...  Not a happiest memory...,not spongebob,0
Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!,spongebob,1
What a majestic view!,spongebob,1
What view?,not spongebob,0
Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?,spongebob,1
Very nice... except that I'm  afraid of heights!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down!,spongebob,1
What?! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...,not spongebob,0
Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here!  You plant it!  All that time and money and resources wasted on...,not spongebob,0
Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!,spongebob,1
Uh oh...,not spongebob,0
Stupid amateurs...  Fantastic...,not spongebob,0
"Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead...",not spongebob,0
Two weeks later...,not spongebob,0
"Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!",spongebob,1
Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!,spongebob,1
Meow...,not spongebob,0
Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? Hello!?  Hello?",spongebob,1
"I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?",spongebob,1
Yes...  Thanks for stopping by.,not spongebob,0
Sigh... meow.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!",spongebob,1
I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
I have a package for a Squidward Tentaclees?,not spongebob,0
Tentacles. Yes that's me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, here you go.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  Gotcha! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!?",not spongebob,0
"Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?",spongebob,1
You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... want... a... happiest memory!,not spongebob,0
So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?,spongebob,1
"I feel wonderful!  This is it, my happiest memory!",not spongebob,0
Sigh... he's so handsome!,spongebob,1
"Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!",not spongebob,0
"Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!",spongebob,1
"Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.",spongebob,1
What's this? Where are the doubloons?,not spongebob,0
"There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt.",spongebob,1
Based on a real treasure map.,not spongebob,0
Take a break and play around with us.,spongebob,1
"Yeah! C'mon, sweaty!",not spongebob,0
Have you finished cleaning the tables?,not spongebob,0
"I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?",not spongebob,0
I already took care of it.,spongebob,1
"Hahaha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.",not spongebob,0
"My turn!  Five!  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm...  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're fired.",not spongebob,0
But I don't even work here!,not spongebob,0
"Would you like a job, starting now?",not spongebob,0
"Boy, would I!",not spongebob,0
You're fired.,not spongebob,0
"My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.",spongebob,1
Shiver me timbers!,not spongebob,0
"Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.",not spongebob,0
"You are a real pirate. Go straight to the X that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.",spongebob,1
"Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one--   Help! Help!  My leg!",not spongebob,0
Can't you see we're closed?!  Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.",not spongebob,0
"I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you can't walk out on me now.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?",spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you gotta...!",spongebob,1
"Tread softly, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs...",spongebob,1
"I'll roll for you, boy.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr...",spongebob,1
"Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr...",spongebob,1
"One, two, three...",not spongebob,0
"MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?",spongebob,1
"A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? Though it is treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.",not spongebob,0
Pirates?,spongebob,1
"Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?",not spongebob,0
"Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!",not spongebob,0
"Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!",spongebob,1
"Now, don't you feel more like pirates?",not spongebob,0
"Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!",spongebob,1
And I'm BlindBeard the Pirate!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,spongebob,1
"Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.",not spongebob,0
Really? Can we see the map?,spongebob,1
Uh... no. Only the captain can lay eyes on the map!,not spongebob,0
"Okie dokie, then!",spongebob,1
"Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, okie dokie, then! A pirate says, arrgh!",not spongebob,0
"Okie... oops.  I mean...  ARRGH, Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH...",spongebob,1
"Out with it man, ARRGH!",not spongebob,0
"I, ARRGH, think, ARRGH, he's trying, ARRGH, to say--  land.",not spongebob,0
"AAAARRGH!!! From now on, only the captain says 'arrgh'! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?",not spongebob,0
"The whole ship is underwater, captain.",spongebob,1
"Arrgh. We're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot.  This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, cap'n?",spongebob,1
"Ensign Patrick, which way is east?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh...  let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!",not spongebob,0
"9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the X? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east!",not spongebob,0
"Ohhhh, east? I thought you said weast.",not spongebob,0
Weast? What kind of compass are you reading lad?,not spongebob,0
"This one, sir.",not spongebob,0
"That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, we're tired.",spongebob,1
And hungry.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just a... bunch of sand!",not spongebob,0
"Don't cry, Captain Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.",spongebob,1
You'll stay with me then?,not spongebob,0
We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!,not spongebob,0
I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!,not spongebob,0
And all for one!,not spongebob,0
"I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.",spongebob,1
"I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks!",not spongebob,0
But we've only been gone a few hours!,spongebob,1
"...I know, hehehehe.",not spongebob,0
"I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!",spongebob,1
Captain Krabs?,not spongebob,0
He's not here.,spongebob,1
Look! The treasure map.,not spongebob,0
"Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Yeah...,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
Nothing.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.",spongebob,1
"I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?",not spongebob,0
"No, guess there isn't.  Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself!",spongebob,1
"THE MAP! THE MAP! GOTTA SEE IT, GOTTA LOOK AT IT!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
Did you notice something familiar about this map?,not spongebob,0
"You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?",spongebob,1
Do you think this is a problem?,not spongebob,0
Ahh! Mr. Krabs!!,not spongebob,0
Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?,not spongebob,0
We're sorry!,not spongebob,0
"That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?",not spongebob,0
"Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!",spongebob,1
I think that.,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!,not spongebob,0
Look! It's the X.,spongebob,1
X marks the spot!,not spongebob,0
Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!,spongebob,1
"Well, what are you waiting for, lads?  Dig! Dig!  Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!",not spongebob,0
"We got it, Captain Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha! Hand it up to me, lads! Heave!  We finally found it!",not spongebob,0
The Dutchman's Treasure!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!,not spongebob,0
We found it together. So we deserve a share!,spongebob,1
"Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!",not spongebob,0
What about loyalty?,spongebob,1
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,spongebob,1
All for one!,not spongebob,0
And one for all!,spongebob,1
All for one!!,not spongebob,0
And one for all!!,spongebob,1
I'm the Flying Dutchman...,not spongebob,0
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,spongebob,1
"I'm the Flying Dutchman...  WHO DARES WAKE THE FLYING DUTCHMAN?! Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
All for one.,not spongebob,0
And one for all.,not spongebob,0
Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure???,not spongebob,0
They did!,not spongebob,0
Arrgh!  So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Two gold doubloons!,not spongebob,0
Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.",not spongebob,0
"Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold!  Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!",not spongebob,0
Plastic!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!",not spongebob,0
"Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.",not spongebob,0
"Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer!  Welcome to art class!!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry...",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!,not spongebob,0
"This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?",spongebob,1
You're looking at him.,not spongebob,0
"You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.",spongebob,1
Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.,not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.",spongebob,1
"So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, please.",spongebob,1
"Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.",not spongebob,0
I have no talent.,spongebob,1
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.,spongebob,1
"If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me.",not spongebob,0
"If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.",spongebob,1
"Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say  circle one.  Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"How's this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.,not spongebob,0
"Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.",spongebob,1
Gimme that.  Forget the circles.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.",spongebob,1
"Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog!  What are you doing, now?",not spongebob,0
"I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time...",spongebob,1
"Do you want to learn art, or not?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.",spongebob,1
"Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently...",not spongebob,0
How's this Squidward?,spongebob,1
"It's beautiful.  I mean... this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!",spongebob,1
"Hello, there!",not spongebob,0
"But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!",spongebob,1
"Good day, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.",not spongebob,0
The world famous art collector?,not spongebob,0
The one and only.,not spongebob,0
"Well, what are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.,not spongebob,0
Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: Squidward en repose.,not spongebob,0
"I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.",not spongebob,0
Why not?,not spongebob,0
Because. It's an art collection!,not spongebob,0
How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.,not spongebob,0
More like: Belongs in the Trash!,not spongebob,0
Sorry. I must've missed that one.,not spongebob,0
Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...",not spongebob,0
"Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw.  Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...",not spongebob,0
Fame!,not spongebob,0
...fortune...,not spongebob,0
Fortune!,not spongebob,0
...anything his heart desires!,not spongebob,0
Anything?!?!  It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!,not spongebob,0
"I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.",not spongebob,0
I could use a little help.  My fame! My fortune! My hair!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.",not spongebob,0
"Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye.  I gotta find SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?",not spongebob,0
"Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.",spongebob,1
"Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.",not spongebob,0
Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them.,spongebob,1
"Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.",not spongebob,0

I... can't!,spongebob,1
"Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!",not spongebob,0
"I did it, Squidward.",spongebob,1

"Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it!  There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da!",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.",not spongebob,0
"First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.",spongebob,1
Now you've got it.,not spongebob,0
I've gotta embrace the marble!,spongebob,1
Right.,not spongebob,0
I've gotta sniff the marble!,spongebob,1
"Well, uh, okay.",not spongebob,0
I've gotta lick the marble!,spongebob,1
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.,spongebob,1

"With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy...",not spongebob,0
"But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.

Are you getting hungry?,spongebob,1

I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us.,spongebob,1
That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though.,not spongebob,0
It couldn't?,spongebob,1
Nope. I had its vocal cords removed before the trip.,not spongebob,0

"Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, but it looks like everything worked out just... fine...",not spongebob,0

It sounded like it came from the other side of this big rock!,not spongebob,0
"This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall!)",spongebob,1
Do you think it belongs to that gift shop right there?,not spongebob,0
What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere?,spongebob,1

"Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff!  You gonna buy something?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not in the market for any souvenirs.",not spongebob,0

Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!,not spongebob,0
Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic  replacement for our recently deflated national treasure!   Won't you little fella?,not spongebob,0

I'm not sure how to respond to that.,not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!,spongebob,1
"Hey! We're stuck here, remember?",not spongebob,0
Why is that?,not spongebob,0
Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left. See?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, heroes! Is there anything we can do?  That's a heavy piece of nothing...  So, is that it?",spongebob,1
"Yes. Uh, thank you, boys. We don't usually do this, but in term for pushing the invisiboat up all those hills, there's something I'd like you to see. But you must promise to not touch anything.",not spongebob,0
Okay!  Wow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582! Man Ray's power glove!",spongebob,1

What went wrong?,not spongebob,0
"Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man, what happened to the tartar sauce?",not spongebob,0
Good thing that was around. I was starving.,not spongebob,0
Curious. Could I have forgotten to refill it?,not spongebob,0

I don't got time for that!,not spongebob,0

"Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time. Hello, fellow citizen.  Hello, Squilliam.",spongebob,1
Man Ray is great.,not spongebob,0
Yeah.  Must be taking care of his community service obligations.,spongebob,1
That'll teach him to jaywalk.,not spongebob,0
"Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city?",spongebob,1
"Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the clatter of prison chains.",not spongebob,0
"I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?",spongebob,1
No. But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard!  It's missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!,not spongebob,0
"Even worse than that, Patrick. The police got new uniforms!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! What did they do with those old ones?!",not spongebob,0
"And yikes! What happened to the Krusty Krab?!  The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?",spongebob,1
I’m all out of Man Ray dollars?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past. And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler. Oh, we got to do something.",spongebob,1
But what?,not spongebob,0
What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis. See if I still have a job!,spongebob,1
"Hey, you’re not eating fast enough!",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, Squidw...",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here?,spongebob,1
Just getting stuck in a wasted life.,not spongebob,0
Order up!,not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man! He's wearing a hairnet!  What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?",spongebob,1
"I lost the desire and the physique to fight long ago, kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you're my age.",not spongebob,0
"What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight.",spongebob,1
"You got spaghetti for brains, kid? We are the younger ones. The older ones...  Bless their souls... have been immortalized in this very restaurant.",not spongebob,0
I am so sorry for your loss of... yourself.,spongebob,1
"I hate to break up the memorial service, but we're out of tartar sauce out here.",not spongebob,0
"Tartar sauce?! The topping that destroyed life as we knew it! If only my tartar sauce attack hadn't failed that day, we wouldn't be living in this wasteland! We're already out?",not spongebob,0
Yep. Chewy bits...,not spongebob,0
"I knew I recognize you from somewhere, you were there. And you ate that tartar sauce on that day! Do you realize what you’ve done?!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mermaid Man. We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help, of course.",spongebob,1
"I'm not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had me by the neck! Oh, e-evil!",not spongebob,0
Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?,spongebob,1
"Barnacles, no! It means he put this electro-collar on me that won't allow me to leave the restaurant!",not spongebob,0
Oh. Let's get the nasty thing off of you.,spongebob,1
Haven't you two idiots done enough damage?,not spongebob,0
"I can't get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?",spongebob,1
Keep away from me!,not spongebob,0
Ta-daaa! You're free! Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?,spongebob,1
"I suppose you’ve proven your medal, kid. But I'll have my eye on you two. Now let's pop that Dirty Bubble!",not spongebob,0
"Actually, we're fighting Man Ray.",spongebob,1
"Oh. Well, in that case, let the lighthouse of justice shine on Ray Man!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I suppose that's close enough. Back to the past, gents, just stop you from eating the tartar sauce again for the first time. Hmm.",not spongebob,0
I am ready to rule the world and its riches!,not spongebob,0
"Not so fast, Man Ray!",not spongebob,0
We've got a little surprise for you.,not spongebob,0
Keep your tongue out of the tartar sauce!,not spongebob,0
Impostors!,not spongebob,0
"Who are you calling impostor, impostor? I must prevent our tartar sauce from being eaten by that fool!",not spongebob,0
If I want to get near my tartar sauce I gotta to go through me first!,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna make me eat those words!,not spongebob,0
Bring it.  Take this!  I’ll never let you win.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, I will.",not spongebob,0
"What do you make of this, Barnacle Boy?",not spongebob,0
"Tangled timeline, Mermaid Man. I-",not spongebob,0
You old coots provided me the perfect distraction. Now prepare to be disappeared!,not spongebob,0
"Sounds good on paper, you purveyor of pure evil, but, fortunately, we all know what happens to paper underwater. Barnacle Boy, the tartar sauce.",not spongebob,0
Wow! I've never eaten that much tartar sauce.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, you have.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it sure ain't sittin' right.",not spongebob,0
"Foolish mools. Once again, your bufoonery has given me victory!  Oh, I'm going to savor this. It's not every day I get to defeat Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy three times over!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don’t eat the tartar sauce!",not spongebob,0
"You’re too late! Your fat friend beat you to it. Now, prepare to taste laser!  So how...",not spongebob,0
I told you we had to go back farther!,not spongebob,0
Uh...,not spongebob,0
"Up, up, and away!",not spongebob,0

I can't get my head around this. Where are they all coming from?  Another machine?,not spongebob,0
I took care of your blasted time machine!,not spongebob,0
Uh! I got to sit down and think this through.,not spongebob,0
Gotta! You've got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, did you say something? I'm still trying to comprehend what just happened here.",not spongebob,0
"It's pretty simple, really. You were defeated by a convoy of continuum-cruising crime stoppers. Thank you, SpongeBob and Patrick.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi there! Hello! Hello! Hello!",not spongebob,0
We just wanted to come back and revisit the day that evil was defeated forever.,not spongebob,0

You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
I heard they have better weather over there.,not spongebob,0
"No! Wait!  This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  At ease!  How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?",not spongebob,0
"I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!",spongebob,1
"I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!",not spongebob,0
"Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!",spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
"One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.",spongebob,1
How?,not spongebob,0
I took him to see a hypnotist.,spongebob,1
You took Patrick to a hypnotist?,not spongebob,0
No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.,spongebob,1
I thought you said it was a barnacle.,not spongebob,0
What did I say?,spongebob,1
Pelican.,not spongebob,0
He was a really good hypnotist.,spongebob,1
Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.,spongebob,1
Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?,not spongebob,0
Hypnosis? No! Hold still now.,spongebob,1
Is everything okay?,not spongebob,0
I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work!,spongebob,1
Did it come off?,not spongebob,0
Gettin' there.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how much longer?",not spongebob,0
"Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.",spongebob,1
Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.,not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?",spongebob,1
There's more!,not spongebob,0
"I mean, you're right. There's more.",spongebob,1
All I did was wash with soap and water!,not spongebob,0
Hmm... Water and... this soap?,spongebob,1
"Yes, but why?",not spongebob,0
"Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
More for me!,spongebob,1
"No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing.",spongebob,1
"Pearl, I'm home!",not spongebob,0
"Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewels!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.",spongebob,1
I'm not going to the dance!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.",spongebob,1
And what exactly would that do to me?,not spongebob,0
"I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!",spongebob,1
How?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again.",spongebob,1
Okay. Where do you keep your soap?,spongebob,1
"In the basement. Duh, where else?",not spongebob,0
Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?",spongebob,1
"Why, it's my old soap press!",not spongebob,0
Soap press?,spongebob,1
"That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
Leftover Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
"Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...",spongebob,1
I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?,not spongebob,0
Krabby Patty essence.,not spongebob,0
That's grease!,not spongebob,0

"The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!",spongebob,1
Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...",spongebob,1
Are you done yet?,not spongebob,0
"All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  And, ta-da. What do you think?",spongebob,1
"I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?",not spongebob,0
We shall see shortly.,spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
Shh. Trust me.,spongebob,1

I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.,not spongebob,0

"No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.",spongebob,1
I want an award!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day.",spongebob,1
I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.,not spongebob,0
But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.,spongebob,1
That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.",spongebob,1
Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!,not spongebob,0

The smallest you can think of.,spongebob,1
A job at the Krusty Krab?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.,spongebob,1
Then let's go.,not spongebob,0
"Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.",not spongebob,0
"And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?",spongebob,1

At least I'm safe inside my mind.,not spongebob,0
Stop copying me!,spongebob,1
There's no award for that!,not spongebob,0

"Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?",spongebob,1
Until I have as many awards as you.,not spongebob,0
We'll see about that!,spongebob,1
"No, we won't.",not spongebob,0
I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.,spongebob,1
"Me, too.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you don't!",not spongebob,0
"Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.,not spongebob,0
My turn!,not spongebob,0
"I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
What's so great about being a big pink loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.,not spongebob,0

"Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!",spongebob,1
Nobody does.  I lost her in the surf when we were kids.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock!,not spongebob,0

"Thanks, sis!",not spongebob,0
Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.,not spongebob,0
"Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.",not spongebob,0
"If big nose no like sand, big nose move!",not spongebob,0
"This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor.",not spongebob,0
No laughing!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you jokester.",spongebob,1
Do you think she looks a little... miffed?,not spongebob,0
Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!,not spongebob,0
Shame on you two! Look what you've done!,not spongebob,0
Look what we've done?!,not spongebob,0
"Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss.",not spongebob,0
"Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder.",not spongebob,0
"Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?",not spongebob,0
Blecorate?,not spongebob,0
"You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!",not spongebob,0
Make new house spiffy.  Spiffy!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!",not spongebob,0
Blecorate.,not spongebob,0
"That's the spirit, Sis.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!",not spongebob,0
"You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!",not spongebob,0
More spiffy!,not spongebob,0
But that's from...  My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!,not spongebob,0
"How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...",not spongebob,0
"Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?",spongebob,1
"No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!",not spongebob,0
"It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-",spongebob,1
Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water!  Meanies go home!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock.",not spongebob,0
Meanies is mean. .,not spongebob,0
"Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.",spongebob,1
The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!,not spongebob,0
I don't think you should do that.,spongebob,1
"Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get!",not spongebob,0
Who makes noise?  Spiffy broken!  Sister mad!,not spongebob,0
"Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.",spongebob,1
Sister Sam rearrange now!,not spongebob,0
Please don't.,spongebob,1
"Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started.",spongebob,1
Huh?!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?",spongebob,1
"Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!",not spongebob,0
That'll teach those meanies.,not spongebob,0
"Your still my rock big, sis.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?!",not spongebob,0
She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess she can get a little carried away.",not spongebob,0

"So, we meet again, Crazyfish!",spongebob,1
Bring it on!,not spongebob,0
With pleasure!,spongebob,1
So loud!,not spongebob,0
"You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!",spongebob,1
"You bet your frosting, Sponge-cake.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting.  Hey, that's cheating!",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You promise you won't laugh?  Okay, here goes.  Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste.  Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd...  Gare...?",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.  Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh!  SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did someone hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson.",spongebob,1
"Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"Hmm...  Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"He was big and mean. Oh, but old SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.",spongebob,1
What did you do?,not spongebob,0
I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.,spongebob,1
With tears?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.",spongebob,1
Then what happened?,not spongebob,0
"I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...",spongebob,1
I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed!,not spongebob,0
"That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy.",spongebob,1
There goes a real hero.,not spongebob,0
"Slugger, that's me.  What the?",spongebob,1
Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Whoa!  Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...",not spongebob,0
Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need them. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.,spongebob,1
"A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.",not spongebob,0
"Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.",spongebob,1
Why? Did he write it down?,not spongebob,0
"No, I engraved it on his pain gland.",spongebob,1
"Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!",spongebob,1
Jack M. Crazyfish?,not spongebob,0
"It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.",spongebob,1
So how'd you get the black eye then?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner.",spongebob,1
"Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty! I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part.",not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking.",spongebob,1
Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.,not spongebob,0
That's right.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm...",not spongebob,0
"Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.",spongebob,1
Not really.,not spongebob,0
"All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?",spongebob,1
"It was me, I said it.",not spongebob,0
"Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum.",spongebob,1
Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.,not spongebob,0
He's right.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  Don't worry, I'll save you. I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!",spongebob,1
"Uh, what did you say he looked like again?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...",spongebob,1
Little green hat?,not spongebob,0
"I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real...",spongebob,1
I'm looking for SpongeBob Squ--,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.",spongebob,1
I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walking, like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?",spongebob,1
"Uh, not really. I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.",spongebob,1
"Where I'm from, sorry don't cut it. We settle things in a different kind of way.",not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. BlackJack.  Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack! The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids!",spongebob,1
"Come on, little man! Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.",not spongebob,0
Why should we?,not spongebob,0
Because it'll show what a little man you are.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man.",not spongebob,0
"That brute has my parents! I got to get over there!  Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents!  Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? Do not cross? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed! NO! Get it together, SquarePants! To face BlackJack, you've got to be as tough as nails!  Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic! The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?  What's this? BlackJack smashed my family portrait! Oh, no! What has he done with my parents?!",spongebob,1
"Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you; what with you in the office all hours of the day.",not spongebob,0
I got a new outfit for ya!,not spongebob,0
"That fiend! Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note.  SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm going to do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack.  He's going to get Grandma, too! I have to stop him!  Grandma, where are you? Are you okay? Grandma? You in here? Grandma?  Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp! Oh, that animal!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?,spongebob,1
"Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.",not spongebob,0
But where's BlackJack?,spongebob,1
"Oh, BlackJack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.",not spongebob,0
Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?!,spongebob,1
"And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun.  And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.",not spongebob,0
"Cleaning up the mess?  I got to get help! I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's! He'll know what to do.  Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help!",spongebob,1
"Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby.",not spongebob,0
I need you to help me rescue my parents!,spongebob,1
"Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right.",not spongebob,0
346 minutes later...,not spongebob,0
"Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents! They're in danger!",spongebob,1
What? You want to build a fence?  The boy came to work.,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I came to try to find my...",spongebob,1
"And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you.  Ah.  And how many candles you burning out there? Over.  Do you copy? Over?  Copy? Do you copy?",not spongebob,0
"Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue! Please help me!",spongebob,1
"Well, of course you can!",not spongebob,0
"Much, much, much later...",not spongebob,0
I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!,spongebob,1
Landscaping? Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping?,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Uncle Captain Blue! We don't have much time. Cousin BlackJack has my parents held captive at his house!",spongebob,1
"They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.",not spongebob,0
That's why we have to rescue them now!,spongebob,1
"Whoa, there, Little Bobby. No can do.",not spongebob,0
"But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you!",spongebob,1
"No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?",not spongebob,0
You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?,spongebob,1
"Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to BlackJack's right now.  Just try to relax until we get there.  There it is. We're here.  Uh, lock the door behind you, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy.",spongebob,1
Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?,not spongebob,0
Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home.  Mother!  Mom?,spongebob,1
Help me!,not spongebob,0
"They're trapped in the basement!  Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here!",spongebob,1
"Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.",not spongebob,0
Party?,spongebob,1
"Oh, why, yes. We're celebrating your cousin BlackJack's release from prison.",not spongebob,0
Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...,not spongebob,0
"I told you, Harold, that was the fumigators' fault.",not spongebob,0
The fumigators? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?,spongebob,1
"The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill, but they should be gone by now.",not spongebob,0
"So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, your cousin BlackJack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.",not spongebob,0
"That's right, little man!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well here comes the man of the hour. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days.",not spongebob,0
"Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?",not spongebob,0
To quiver!,spongebob,1
I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time! THAT'S IT! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle?! Well, let's tussle it up!  Cousin BlackJack?",spongebob,1
In the living flesh!,not spongebob,0
That tickles!,spongebob,1
"Just like the old days, eh, cousin?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit.",spongebob,1
"97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?",not spongebob,0
Breathing.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.",not spongebob,0
"I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--",spongebob,1
I don't care what Mr. Krabs says! I just want--,not spongebob,0
Coffee rain!,spongebob,1
It's hot chocolate.,not spongebob,0
"Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait!",spongebob,1
It's locked!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Huh? The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid...",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Oh, why can't I just find?",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
What?!,not spongebob,0
"You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?,spongebob,1
"Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.",not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
So I could get further away from you!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?",not spongebob,0
"No, but you can help yourself to this ticket.",not spongebob,0
"Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school.",not spongebob,0
"Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?  Boating school.  Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Good morning class. Would everyone please take a seat?,not spongebob,0
"Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.",spongebob,1
"Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left.",not spongebob,0
But there's one right next to SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Do you mind?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.",spongebob,1
"We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?",not spongebob,0
Quiet in the front please.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.",spongebob,1
"Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.",not spongebob,0
"Um, I got caught speeding.",not spongebob,0
Very good. Next.,not spongebob,0
I don't see what's so very good about it.,not spongebob,0
"No, I didn't mean very.",not spongebob,0
I know exactly what you meant.,not spongebob,0
Next.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I am here because I.",spongebob,1
"We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir?",not spongebob,0
Me?,not spongebob,0
"Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?",not spongebob,0
"Why I'm.  All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!",not spongebob,0
"Yours too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.",not spongebob,0
"Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?",not spongebob,0
"Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.",not spongebob,0
His side?,not spongebob,0
"Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever.",not spongebob,0
Do you like it Squidward?,spongebob,1
Shut it.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy?",spongebob,1
"I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?",spongebob,1
"Mmm, Bon appétit, Squiddy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my...",not spongebob,0
"Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, didn't see that coming.",not spongebob,0
"Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, step on the gas?",spongebob,1
Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!",not spongebob,0
"I got it, I got it.",spongebob,1
Just let go of it!,not spongebob,0
Hooligans!,not spongebob,0
"Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.",not spongebob,0
How?,not spongebob,0
By using this shrink ray.,not spongebob,0
Mother of mercy!  Where'd they go?,not spongebob,0
There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip.,not spongebob,0
What's the matter?,not spongebob,0
Potato chips are his favorite snack.  Johnson! No!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no.",not spongebob,0
I never will understand these city folk.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, where'd Squidward go?",spongebob,1

"Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-",spongebob,1
"How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!",not spongebob,0
"Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.",spongebob,1
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
3 more minutes class.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.",not spongebob,0
2 more minutes.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, please? This is important.",not spongebob,0
"You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.",spongebob,1
"No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before.",not spongebob,0
Before what?,spongebob,1
Before before.,not spongebob,0
"1 more minute, class.",not spongebob,0
"Before we were,  boating buddies.",not spongebob,0
Yay!,spongebob,1
"Okay class, time’s up.",not spongebob,0
Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?,not spongebob,0
"You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.",not spongebob,0
Next week?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.  But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school!",spongebob,1
"This is it, Gary!",spongebob,1

"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm getting mine next.",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.",spongebob,1
Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you.,not spongebob,0
How are we going to do that?,spongebob,1
"Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head?",spongebob,1

"Splendid! Wonderful!  There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head?  Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna?  And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers?  Oh, yes, but that would be cheating.",not spongebob,0
HAHA! CHEATING!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!,not spongebob,0
I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!,spongebob,1
"Yes, my star pupil?",not spongebob,0
I think I'm cheating...,spongebob,1
"What's that, dear?",not spongebob,0
I think I am cheating!,spongebob,1
You've... you've let go of the wheel.,not spongebob,0
I do have an antenna under my hat!  There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!,spongebob,1
WHAT!?!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!",spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!",spongebob,1
Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff. This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.,not spongebob,0
"Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts.",not spongebob,0
Ripping good day for a spot of driving.,not spongebob,0
And a driver without boat smarts.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!",spongebob,1
"Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure.  Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level.  While this driver pays no need to boat smarts.  Buckling Up.  As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision.  Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign.  Now this driver, with no regard for safety.  Well, at least he had his seat belt on.  Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now?  You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, perfect.",spongebob,1
"Hey, use your mirrors, fool!",not spongebob,0
"Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet.",spongebob,1
Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road.  And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety.",not spongebob,0
Jerk!,not spongebob,0
Hi there!,spongebob,1
Help! Lunatic driver!,not spongebob,0
How's it going?,spongebob,1
I can't feel my hair. My leg!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law.",not spongebob,0
"Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!,spongebob,1
Never mind.,not spongebob,0
Closing time. The happiest time of the day!,not spongebob,0
"Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.",spongebob,1
What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!,not spongebob,0
Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.",spongebob,1
"And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun.",not spongebob,0
But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.,spongebob,1
You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?,not spongebob,0
The next day...,not spongebob,0
"Order up, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.",spongebob,1
"Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?,not spongebob,0
What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.,not spongebob,0
"Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?",not spongebob,0
Because it growled at me.,spongebob,1
"You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No... no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then...  SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.",not spongebob,0
"So I'm gonna be okay, doc?",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart.  Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no!  Oh no, this is terrible!",not spongebob,0
"Everything okay, doc?",not spongebob,0
Don't touch me!,not spongebob,0
That's not a good sign.,not spongebob,0
"Har, har har har har har har har har har!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!",not spongebob,0
"Eugene Krabs, your time has come.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room.  Excuse me, nurse?",not spongebob,0
Yes?,not spongebob,0
I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's in that room right there.",not spongebob,0
"No, that's Harold Flower's room.",not spongebob,0
Harold Flower?,not spongebob,0
"So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?",not spongebob,0
What do you want from me?,not spongebob,0
I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!,not spongebob,0
Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!  Here we are.",not spongebob,0
Blec! Why does it smell so foul?,not spongebob,0
Davy Jones works out a lot.  These are his socks. Get in!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.",not spongebob,0
Mommy!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.",not spongebob,0
You have me word as a sailor.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, boys!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?",spongebob,1
"Well, it was.",not spongebob,0
"You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?",not spongebob,0
A Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?",not spongebob,0
I don't go hungry?,not spongebob,0
"No, silly! It means free toy!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.",not spongebob,0
"I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.",spongebob,1
Great!,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, sir.",spongebob,1
Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?,not spongebob,0
"Eugene, my man.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! How's the break coming?,not spongebob,0
"Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?",not spongebob,0
This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!,not spongebob,0
No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.,not spongebob,0
"Here's your mail, Eugene.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.",not spongebob,0
"Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And...there's no money in here.  How delightful.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Me, too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.",not spongebob,0
Uh... dream?,not spongebob,0
Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!,not spongebob,0
"Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.",spongebob,1
Here's the bill.,not spongebob,0
"You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!",not spongebob,0
Your luck just ran out!,not spongebob,0
"Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.",not spongebob,0
"Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.",not spongebob,0
A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!,not spongebob,0
"I'm not cheap, I'm generous!",not spongebob,0
You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.",not spongebob,0
Wait just a burger-flipping second!,spongebob,1
Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?,not spongebob,0
"That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.",spongebob,1
He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.,not spongebob,0
I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.,spongebob,1
"You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?",not spongebob,0
"That depends, how much money we talking about?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
62 cents.,not spongebob,0
I'll take the money.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Squidward, money!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?",not spongebob,0
You think I could've gotten more?,not spongebob,0
He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!",not spongebob,0
"Here, take him back.",not spongebob,0
You heard what I said about the money?,not spongebob,0
"Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!",not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!",spongebob,1
He's your problem now.,not spongebob,0
"Heh, about trading you for pocket change...",not spongebob,0
"Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.",spongebob,1
You would have?,not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
Dutchman's residence.,not spongebob,0
"So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.",spongebob,1
"La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The Ild Ones! That's a strange name.  Scallop!  Bye Ild Ones. I like your silly name. Hmm...w. Oh, oh, they're not the Ild Ones. They must be the Wild Ones.",spongebob,1
"The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!",not spongebob,0
"No; I don't know who you are, either.",spongebob,1
"Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon!",not spongebob,0
Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?,not spongebob,0
"There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!",spongebob,1
"Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?",not spongebob,0
Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!,spongebob,1
What are you going on about? Bikers?,not spongebob,0
"The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea.",spongebob,1
"Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, this is serious!",spongebob,1
That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course.,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"A horrible biker gang called the Wild Ones are coming. We've got to run, hide!",spongebob,1
"Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around.,not spongebob,0
"Like this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
That's it.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.",spongebob,1
Huh.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I heard you. But what didn't hear was a hello.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.  Bloodthirsty bikers! Ah! We got to hide!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
"I... I don't want to talk about it, man.",not spongebob,0
Hide me!,not spongebob,0
"No, hide me!",spongebob,1
Hide me!,not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
"No, me!",not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
Me!,not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
No! No more running.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants.,not spongebob,0
Their leather socks.,spongebob,1
"If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.",not spongebob,0
"Say that again, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Little baby doody-heads?,not spongebob,0
"No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?",spongebob,1
I wouldn't mess with ya.,not spongebob,0
"Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, I feel protected now.",not spongebob,0
"Those are some mean looking rides, dudes.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.",spongebob,1
See?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's your salivation.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?",spongebob,1
Does that part include laughing at you? ‘Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.,not spongebob,0
Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?,spongebob,1
I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?",spongebob,1
"No, I don't.",not spongebob,0
What about our biker club?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
How about our biker organization?,spongebob,1
"No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.",not spongebob,0
What about our coalition?,spongebob,1
"Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.",not spongebob,0
"We'll just pencil you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.",spongebob,1
This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.,not spongebob,0
"Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.,not spongebob,0
Then can we save the town?,spongebob,1
Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me!  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind!  Oh. Thanks, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.",not spongebob,0
"Me? Annoying?  Yeah, right.",spongebob,1
"You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.",not spongebob,0
"What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...",spongebob,1
Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming!,not spongebob,0
"The Wild Ones?  Mable, get the kids!",not spongebob,0
"Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?",not spongebob,0
Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.,not spongebob,0
"What's that, missy?",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Howdy, we're the Mild Ones.",not spongebob,0
Mild Ones?  Oh!,spongebob,1
"Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.",not spongebob,0
Don't you want to spend any money?,not spongebob,0
Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride.,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?",spongebob,1
Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!,not spongebob,0
"Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make.",not spongebob,0
Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!,spongebob,1
"Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!",not spongebob,0
How disappointing.,not spongebob,0
"You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!",not spongebob,0
Hello? Daddy?,not spongebob,0
Thar she blows!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?",not spongebob,0
No new spatulas?,spongebob,1
"No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
"So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.",not spongebob,0
"Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!",spongebob,1
"All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, pole.",spongebob,1
"Hi, guys.",not spongebob,0
It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!,not spongebob,0
"Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.",not spongebob,0
I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!,not spongebob,0
What's in the box?,spongebob,1
It's a surprise.,not spongebob,0
I like surprises.,spongebob,1
"Great, then close your eyes.",not spongebob,0
I'm ready!,spongebob,1
"Well, I like it so far.",not spongebob,0
Ta-da...  It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!",spongebob,1
Fish paste.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!",spongebob,1
"Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.",not spongebob,0
"Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too.",not spongebob,0
Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!,not spongebob,0
"Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.",not spongebob,0
Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.,not spongebob,0
Squidward is such a barnacle.,not spongebob,0
A stick in the sand.,spongebob,1
"But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.",not spongebob,0
Me? Really?,spongebob,1
"Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here.",spongebob,1
"Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?",not spongebob,0
"For what, dare I ask?",not spongebob,0
"The new name for our new look. I mean, The Krusty Krab has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!",not spongebob,0
"Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?,spongebob,1
Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?,not spongebob,0
The King Krab?,spongebob,1
The Kandy Krab!,not spongebob,0
The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!,spongebob,1
Aaah! No!,not spongebob,0
"You're right, too scary.",spongebob,1
The Kuddly Krab!,not spongebob,0
It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
"That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?",not spongebob,0
That's it! I quit!,not spongebob,0
"Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision.",not spongebob,0
"Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, order up!",not spongebob,0
Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.,spongebob,1
"Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.",not spongebob,0
But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.,spongebob,1
Exactly.,not spongebob,0
"All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.",spongebob,1
This is so cool!,not spongebob,0
Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?,spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!",not spongebob,0
Uh... right on.,spongebob,1
Check out this new menu I came up with.,not spongebob,0
Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
"Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.  I've got something more fun for you to do anyway.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention!",not spongebob,0
"This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?",spongebob,1
"Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.",spongebob,1
Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.",spongebob,1
How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
"What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?",not spongebob,0
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.",spongebob,1
"That's it, boy!",not spongebob,0
What's it?,spongebob,1
You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.,not spongebob,0
"That's not what I said, sir.",spongebob,1
"Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office.",not spongebob,0
"Totally rude, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?",spongebob,1
"Sure, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes.",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!,not spongebob,0
"Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!",spongebob,1
"No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?",not spongebob,0
I got it! I can pretend to  fire you. I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.,spongebob,1
"Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!",not spongebob,0
Stop trying to break me in half?,spongebob,1
"Deal.  Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl, I need to have a word with you!",spongebob,1
"Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.",not spongebob,0
"It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...",spongebob,1
"Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...",spongebob,1
"I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, you're fired.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob.  Come on, gang, the mall awaits!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!",spongebob,1
"Oh, Pearly...  Is that a $20?  Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?",not spongebob,0
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
She's off to bigger and better things.,spongebob,1
"That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff?",not spongebob,0
"Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Ooh— Ooh— Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?,spongebob,1
We're so lucky.,not spongebob,0
Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar.  Whaa?  Huh?,spongebob,1
"Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, we need the combination!",not spongebob,0
I got it covered.,spongebob,1
Nyah!,not spongebob,0
Doink!  Mm. Mm-hmm.  Voilà!,spongebob,1
Ahh—ooh!,not spongebob,0
See? This is fun!,spongebob,1
Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso!  Ahh! Can't see my own feet.,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm. Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.,spongebob,1
Out of sight... Out of my mind.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, watch it!  Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks!  He'll pop out any second now.  Well?  Nothing. All right.  I really did it!  Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?",not spongebob,0
"It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it! Just don't blow it this time.",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Oh! Ahh!  Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula?  Ohh!  I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.",spongebob,1
"That's a trash can, you nitwit!  The formula?!  Face it, SpongeBob!  The formula—",not spongebob,0
Don't say it!,spongebob,1
Is gone.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I asked you not to say it!  Why would you ever do that?",spongebob,1
Come on.  Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up.  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please!  Oh, thank you.",not spongebob,0
Ah! It's alive!,spongebob,1
Hold on.  Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!  What are we gonna do?,spongebob,1
Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Come on! Open up!  Ahh!  Open Sesame?  It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.",not spongebob,0
"Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock.  It won't open until tomorrow morning.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I've waited this long.  What's a few more  excruciatingly long  hours?",not spongebob,0
"Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.",spongebob,1
Don't let the bed urchins bite.,not spongebob,0
"Eh, sure. You, too, you two.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's go get that formula.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, we are gonna pull  a Plankton on Plankton!",spongebob,1
Nyah! Whaa?,not spongebob,0
Sorry.  Stepped on my tail.,spongebob,1
What are you wearing?,not spongebob,0
"I'm a cat burglar!  Okay, I'll change.",spongebob,1
Hang on.  Ooh.,spongebob,1
And just how am I supposed to get in?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain!  I love a good romance.",not spongebob,0
Phew.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, honey.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Making sure he's asleep.,spongebob,1
Yeesh!  Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!",spongebob,1
Will you get him off of me?!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Ahh!  Get the stick, boy!  Fetch!",spongebob,1
Look out!,not spongebob,0
Diodes...zebras...Make a new batch of chum...,not spongebob,0
It's okay. She's in sleep mode.,spongebob,1
"Oh, dear, the chum is escaping.",not spongebob,0
This must be it.,not spongebob,0
Remain still for retina scan.,not spongebob,0
Now what'll we do?,not spongebob,0
Good thing I brought this!  They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.,spongebob,1
Looks like they captured the rest of him too!,not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
I'll take it from here.,not spongebob,0
I'm fine.,spongebob,1
You go first this time.,not spongebob,0
Hmm-mmph.,spongebob,1
You okay?,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!,spongebob,1
Heh...sorry.,spongebob,1
Ahh.  I can't believe that actually worked!,spongebob,1
"Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er... Why are you two smoldering?",not spongebob,0
"We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.",not spongebob,0
"No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed!",spongebob,1
You did what!?!?!? Plankton stole me formula?!,not spongebob,0
That's what he said. Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Then I'll just have to steal it back.  Hmm. Uh-huh.  Oh.  Don't worry. Papa's here.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!  Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no! Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you.  You're me new security system.",not spongebob,0
Yay!,spongebob,1
Wait! I'm claustrophobic!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Spatula down, sailor!",not spongebob,0
"What's going on, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"According to the nice man from the Labor Authority, it's time for your break, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
We get breaks?,spongebob,1
Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Well, of course you do, boy-o. Why, if I don't give you a five-minute break once every 20 years, this lovely man could fine me big bucks.",not spongebob,0
Nice meeting you.,spongebob,1
"And you don't want me to get fined, do you?",not spongebob,0
No! Never.,spongebob,1
Good! Then you just sit here and don't do or say nothing for five minutes  Oh—and enjoy your break.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! What are you doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, I just spotted a spot.",spongebob,1
"You can't work on your break, boy-o! Period! Remember the fines?",not spongebob,0
"I knew it! I've had my eye on you for years, Krabs! Oh, this violation is really gonna cost you!  Hmm...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can see we're gonna have to take drastic measures here.",not spongebob,0
Employee break room? I never knew this was here!,spongebob,1
"Oh, it's beautiful! Like stepping through a portal into the magical realm beyond!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, whatever. Five minutes!",not spongebob,0
I just hope there's enough time to enjoy everything.  Ooh!,spongebob,1
"Ooh.  Enjoy your carousel, my little hot dog friends.",spongebob,1
Surf's up!  Wipe out.,spongebob,1
I think this used to be...creamed corn!,spongebob,1
"Sorry, bub. Ha! I was meatloaf before I expired.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Globby, you're so silly.",spongebob,1
Voilà! My break room band. Scrubby and the Cleaning Crew. Hmm...  Let's see if I wired everything right.  Perfect.  Yeah!,spongebob,1
"Huh?  Ooh, music. I didn't know the Krusty Krab had a lounge.  Ooh!",not spongebob,0
Shake a leg!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on in, everyone. Try the funk, it's fresh.",spongebob,1
"I sure dig that! There we go, yes!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Where'd all me paying customers go?  What— Ow! What the—  A party?! I don't remember charging anyone for a party on me premises!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
"All right, that's it! Five minutes are up, SpongeBob! Break's over, everyone out! Everyone out! Out, out, out, out, out!",not spongebob,0
"You're in compliance this time, Krabs.  After-break at my house!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, that was so much fun! I can't wait for my next break in 20 years!",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, boy-o, 'cause it's time you got back to making me money.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Hmm, wonder where Squidward got to. Oh, well.",spongebob,1
"Hey, bub, have you seen my lid anywhere?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I'm on my break.",not spongebob,0
"Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick. We're all out.",spongebob,1
"Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip!?",not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
What are you two morons doing?,not spongebob,0
Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.,spongebob,1
At 3:47 in the morning?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
In my bedroom?,not spongebob,0
We come here every morning.,spongebob,1
You sneak into my house every morning?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
It's our favorite pastime.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?,not spongebob,0
Story time!,not spongebob,0
"Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave.",spongebob,1
"And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--",not spongebob,0
3 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
--for as long as time shall stand.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Get out!  Perfect.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party.",spongebob,1
"Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is so neat.",spongebob,1
"I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in.",not spongebob,0
Let's do it again.,not spongebob,0
Let's do it again.,spongebob,1
"Can we, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Huh? What? No! Get out!,not spongebob,0
But--,spongebob,1
"No! You're going out this door, right now--",not spongebob,0
"You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us.",spongebob,1
Do they have cute sea horses there?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they're pretty adorable.",spongebob,1
And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
Can I come?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh—yeah.  Good night, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Uh, new glasses?",not spongebob,0
"No, no. I mean he seems happier.",spongebob,1
"Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you!",not spongebob,0
He's probably happy about his new glasses.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, SpongeBob.  Honk!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, what are you doing here?",spongebob,1
"You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us.",spongebob,1
"Hello, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?,spongebob,1
I wanted to help you work.,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Mr. Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!,not spongebob,0
How are we today? Everything a-okay here?,not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke.,not spongebob,0
"Mommy, I'm scared.",not spongebob,0
Who wants a free refill?,not spongebob,0
Did someone just say free?  What's the problem here?,not spongebob,0
"He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce,  and then he gave me a free hat!",not spongebob,0
Free?!  Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them.",spongebob,1
They look okay to me.,not spongebob,0
But he's not a real fry cook.,spongebob,1
"He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.",not spongebob,0
"Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
What's the meaning of this?,not spongebob,0
What's wrong with it?,spongebob,1
A smiley face with dimples?,not spongebob,0
Dimples? It was him! New Squidward did it.,spongebob,1
Mr. Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
"I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month.",not spongebob,0
"Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know.",not spongebob,0
The guy you're looking for is over there.,spongebob,1
Oh. SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--",not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm?,spongebob,1
Help me spell 'Squidward'.,not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house!",not spongebob,0
"Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake.",spongebob,1
I love being Employee of the Month.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy  but me!  Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there.",spongebob,1
He's too proud.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I want to dance funny, too!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, what's the big idea?  I don't need this aggravation! Why are you still standing here?!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!  What is happening in me restaurant?!,not spongebob,0
"The customers have gone crazy!  SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!",not spongebob,0
"But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing.  SpongeBob has passed away!",not spongebob,0
Or...maybe he's just seriously injured.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.",not spongebob,0
With pleasure!  What? Too soon?,not spongebob,0
Prepare yourselves for the horror.  Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Okay.",not spongebob,0
"But probably, like I said, the horror!",not spongebob,0
Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face!  Get away from him!,not spongebob,0
Such a nice kid.,not spongebob,0
"I—I—  Oh, good morning, everyone.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're alive!",not spongebob,0
"I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?",spongebob,1
"You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.",not spongebob,0
"You mean, the best.",not spongebob,0
"Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up.  See?  Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.",spongebob,1
"Oh, my clock!",spongebob,1
"Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together.  It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.",spongebob,1
"Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow.  Or else.",not spongebob,0
Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?,not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you.  Wow!",spongebob,1
"Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.",spongebob,1
"That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know,  I could totally fix your clock for you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and—  Well, okay, are you sure?",spongebob,1
"Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful.  Why don't you fix?!  Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.",spongebob,1
Hmm!  In that case...,not spongebob,0
"Um, hello?",spongebob,1
"Hello, there!  Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time  for a bargain. How can I help you?",not spongebob,0
Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?,spongebob,1
"Hmm…  Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second,  I have many others I can show you.",not spongebob,0
"Wow. So many to choose from.  Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. I'll just take 'em all!",spongebob,1
"Ah! I'm rich!  Whoo!  Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works.  Goodnight, Gare-bear.",spongebob,1
One hour later...,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
Late.,not spongebob,0
I hope this one works.,spongebob,1
Late again...,not spongebob,0
Late!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
You get the idea!,not spongebob,0
"Late!  Late!  Late!  Still late!  Late!  Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!",not spongebob,0
Still late.,not spongebob,0
"Late again.  I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow.  Or else.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know how many more or elses I can take.  I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what a great idea!",spongebob,1
"0 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I really thought that last or else would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.",not spongebob,0
"Right on time!  Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.",not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
Good morning...,spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today.  D'oh!",not spongebob,0
"Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Just five more minutes, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Sir, there's a line.",not spongebob,0
I'm filing a complaint.  I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.",not spongebob,0
What in Poseidon's beard?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, looks like it's—",not spongebob,0
Time for or else?,spongebob,1
You better be at work on time or else  I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, what?  No!",spongebob,1
I did it!,not spongebob,0
"Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!",spongebob,1
"Uh, kind of.",not spongebob,0
"Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.",not spongebob,0
"Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga-dinga!",not spongebob,0
Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey, Squidward! Want to play?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Are you sure?,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy!  Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!",spongebob,1
Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!",spongebob,1
How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?,not spongebob,0
"I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!",spongebob,1
"This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm not hungry.",spongebob,1
"Well, thanks for stopping by.",not spongebob,0
Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!,spongebob,1
Why would I do that?,not spongebob,0
He's hungry.,spongebob,1
"He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!",not spongebob,0
"What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.",not spongebob,0
I'm not taking an order for a bubble.,not spongebob,0
Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit.,not spongebob,0
May I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything.",spongebob,1
"One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table.",not spongebob,0
Bubble Buddy's thirsty.,spongebob,1
How about a glass of our finest shampoo?,not spongebob,0
Sounds great!,spongebob,1
"Here's your hair care product, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?",spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
Think of the customer.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!",spongebob,1
And?,not spongebob,0
"Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?",spongebob,1
We? How about you take these patties and sh...,not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.",spongebob,1
"What, is he allergic to bread, too?",not spongebob,0
"Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...",spongebob,1
"Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.",not spongebob,0
"That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab.",not spongebob,0
What's this?,not spongebob,0
Bubble money.  At least they left a tip!,not spongebob,0
"Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here.",spongebob,1
"Dudes, bury me!",not spongebob,0
See what I mean?  All done!,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy.",spongebob,1
"Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in.  Dude?",not spongebob,0
My friend's in there.,spongebob,1
Congratulations.,not spongebob,0
Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!,spongebob,1
"It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!",not spongebob,0
"Later, groupies!  Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again.",not spongebob,0

Popcorn! Peanuts!,not spongebob,0
Ice cold drinks!,not spongebob,0

"Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished!",spongebob,1
He kept us waiting for a bubble?,not spongebob,0
That's nothing! He called us fat!,not spongebob,0
He washed my flipper!,not spongebob,0
He owes me money!,not spongebob,0
He made me provide excellent service!,not spongebob,0
Dudes! He made me experience high tide!,not spongebob,0

No... But are we just gonna wait around until he does?,not spongebob,0
I say we tip something over!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey!",not spongebob,0

Get the lifeguard!,not spongebob,0
Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?,not spongebob,0
Pop the bubble!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?",spongebob,1
Yes...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?",spongebob,1
No...,not spongebob,0
Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.",spongebob,1
No. Go as in...,not spongebob,0
Why?!,spongebob,1
You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!,not spongebob,0
No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never...,spongebob,1
"Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!",not spongebob,0

So long.,spongebob,1
Happy Leif Erikson Day!,not spongebob,0

Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.,spongebob,1
Uh...hi?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you stupid bubble, I just washed those!",not spongebob,0
My spine!,not spongebob,0
Why don't you watch where you're going?!,not spongebob,0
Get back here!,not spongebob,0
I'll sue!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see now. Dear SpongeBob...",spongebob,1
"The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!",spongebob,1
"♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.",spongebob,1
"No, I don't!",not spongebob,0
You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.,spongebob,1
"So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!",spongebob,1
Would you please get your friend out of my house?,not spongebob,0
Where is he?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  Oh no! You don't think he p-p-p-p-popped in there ...?!",spongebob,1
There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!,not spongebob,0
Phew...,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha!",spongebob,1
Of course.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!",spongebob,1
"Shiny, no!",spongebob,1
"Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window!",spongebob,1
"I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye!",spongebob,1
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Morning, laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?",not spongebob,0
"This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.",spongebob,1
"Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble.",spongebob,1
Put it there!  Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Come here you little rascal!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.",spongebob,1
"Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?",not spongebob,0
"Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.",spongebob,1
"Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.",spongebob,1
Woooowww! Hernia.,not spongebob,0
What in the name of Neptune is going on-,not spongebob,0
Money! Yay!,not spongebob,0
"There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt.",spongebob,1
You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.,not spongebob,0
"That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the let's do nothing at all game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-",spongebob,1
Shiny? Shiny where are you?,spongebob,1
"Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get you to my house and keep you away from sharp pointy things.",spongebob,1
"Oh, tartar sauce. Oooh!",spongebob,1
"Bikini Bottom Pin Factory?! Shiny, no! I'll save you!  You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose.",spongebob,1
"Where's Shiny? Oh, no!  Scissor Works? I'll save you, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed!",spongebob,1
"Shiny?  Pitchfork Pantry. Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace safe for you to visit. Ah, that's it. The Pillow Foundry. You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.",spongebob,1
"Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know!",spongebob,1
"Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, now!  Phew, he's okay.",spongebob,1
Uh-oh.,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's...  ...doing great.",spongebob,1
"I see you've grown a second head, again, son.",not spongebob,0
Again?,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it.  So, did my son behave himself?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil, sort of way.",spongebob,1
"Well, see you later.",not spongebob,0
"Bye-bye. Anytime you need a babysitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.",spongebob,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the most fascinating place on Earth, Bubbletown! A bouncing, vibrant city, where everyone... and everything is comprised entirely of globules of air!",not spongebob,0
Ooh!  A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!,spongebob,1
Let's take a closer look at this effervescent city! Some bubbletowners drive to work in their bubble cars. While others simply float. Having a bubble car is great because parking is a cinch!  Bubbletown also provides excellent public transportation. Seats are always available because these high-tech buses can account for any number of passengers.  Here are some workers going to work in their bubble building.,not spongebob,0
"You may wanna use the door.  This office uses stand-up desks, and the ceiling for a more efficient work environment.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa-whoa.  Wow!",spongebob,1
"Yes, there's all kinds of things to see and do in Bubbletown! You can enjoy Bubbletown's very own band!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
"And if you're hungry, why not try a bubble dog from one of our many bubble food vendors?",not spongebob,0
"One, please?",spongebob,1
Here you are.,not spongebob,0
"Mmm!  Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs!  Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Gee, it's good to see ya!",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, oops. Sorry.",spongebob,1
"Oh, don't worry about it.",not spongebob,0
"So, how you been? How are things?",spongebob,1
"Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter.",not spongebob,0
Let me see if I can fix that for you.,spongebob,1
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.",not spongebob,0
"Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!",not spongebob,0
"You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof.",not spongebob,0
Honey!,not spongebob,0
I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...,spongebob,1
And...clear!,not spongebob,0
Count me in!,spongebob,1
Fantastic!,not spongebob,0
"Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!",not spongebob,0
I need some pajamas.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, mm, uh-huh.",spongebob,1
I want another sandwich!,not spongebob,0
Monster truck tires!,not spongebob,0
"Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!",spongebob,1
"Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown!",spongebob,1
Watch out for those—,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—",spongebob,1
"Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Whoa!  My eyes!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, come back!",not spongebob,0
"Amy, will you marry me?",not spongebob,0
Yes! I will!,not spongebob,0
Aw.,not spongebob,0
I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.,not spongebob,0
I wuv to learn!,not spongebob,0
Hey! That was my job!,not spongebob,0
I'm so sorry! I can't stop!,spongebob,1
Watch out!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.",not spongebob,0
No! Stay away!  I'm a monster!  A monster!  Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!,spongebob,1
My bubble legs!,not spongebob,0
My monster truck tires!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, that doesn't look great.  But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.",not spongebob,0
I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.",spongebob,1
"All right, you get one phone call.",not spongebob,0
"Okay.  The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second.  Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um... I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry!",spongebob,1
Later…,not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Du, huh, what, who?",not spongebob,0
What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?,not spongebob,0
I'm okay!,not spongebob,0
Well…?,not spongebob,0
What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.,not spongebob,0
What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—",spongebob,1
"Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can!",not spongebob,0
Wha—whoa.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.",spongebob,1
"Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!",not spongebob,0
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!,not spongebob,0
"Eat claw, bubble cop!",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh?,not spongebob,0
Honey!,not spongebob,0
"Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here.  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
You popped it all.  There's nothing left!,spongebob,1
"Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.",not spongebob,0
"No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved.",spongebob,1
"So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Let's blow this popsicle stand.,spongebob,1
"I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
"Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o!  I am making money claw over fist here.  Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?",not spongebob,0
There is none!,not spongebob,0
Exchange rate?,not spongebob,0
That's it. We're done here.,not spongebob,0
Huh.,spongebob,1
I wuv to learn!,not spongebob,0
After you.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, thank you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
My turn.,not spongebob,0
Neato.  Watch this.,spongebob,1
Wow.  Monosodium glutamate!,not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles.",not spongebob,0
Hmm...,spongebob,1
I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.,not spongebob,0
Nah.,not spongebob,0
"20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
Squidward.,not spongebob,0
What? What? Who said that?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request?",not spongebob,0
Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?,not spongebob,0
Avenge me.,not spongebob,0
Avenge me?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
I must have more.,not spongebob,0
You want more?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you moron, you ruined my bon…  ...sai.",not spongebob,0
Let's go to Sandy's.,spongebob,1
"Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy",not spongebob,0
Maybe even smarter.,spongebob,1
"Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.",not spongebob,0
Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb.,not spongebob,0
"I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you.",spongebob,1
"That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines.",not spongebob,0
Oops.,spongebob,1
"I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.",not spongebob,0
Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door.,spongebob,1
Even I knew that was dumb.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?,spongebob,1
I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.",not spongebob,0
She's totally losing it.,not spongebob,0
Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.,not spongebob,0
Never mind. She seems fine.,not spongebob,0
"Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight.",spongebob,1
"Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut.",not spongebob,0
"Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.,not spongebob,0
Ahh...  You taste like glass.,not spongebob,0
Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.,spongebob,1
Get what over with?,not spongebob,0
Where's Sandy,spongebob,1
I thought she was with you.,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,spongebob,1
"Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.",not spongebob,0
"No Sandy, you need air, not food!",spongebob,1
Hey! What's going on out here?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.",spongebob,1
"Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. I believe. Good old atomic number eight.",not spongebob,0
"Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.",not spongebob,0
But how are you gonna get them down?,not spongebob,0
Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.,spongebob,1
Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back.",spongebob,1
"Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'm ready.",spongebob,1
"Just a little bit further. Okay, got it.",not spongebob,0
"Hurry up, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hm-mmm.,not spongebob,0
Looks like her color's coming back.,not spongebob,0
"That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air.",spongebob,1
I said what?,not spongebob,0
"So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy.",not spongebob,0
"Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later.",not spongebob,0
"No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I guess so.",not spongebob,0
"And you breathe air, right?",spongebob,1
"Sure, my nose is full of it.",not spongebob,0
You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.,spongebob,1
I guess us mammals have to stick together.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.",spongebob,1
But how are you going to get up there?,not spongebob,0
I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.,spongebob,1
"An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"I know. Wish me luck, old friend.",spongebob,1
"SquarePants, I salute you.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down.",spongebob,1
"Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghost!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, here we go.",spongebob,1
"Ah, ah! Oof!",not spongebob,0
"Welcome back, Sandy.",spongebob,1
I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble.",spongebob,1
"Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. At least it's structurally sound.  Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.",not spongebob,0
"Then why don't you fix this rust bucket up? Look around. Chipping paint, bad plumbing, dust bunnies--  it's no wonder you don't have any customers.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul.  Whoa! Whoa!  I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor.  Ah! This is a job for an imbecile!  Or two imbeciles.  Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.",not spongebob,0
"Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Uh-huh. I came prepared, too.  Alright, let’s do it.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.",not spongebob,0
"Pizzazz, yeah!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, really?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen now, would you?",not spongebob,0
"No, sir. Uh-uh.",not spongebob,0
"Well, hop to it, lads.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.",not spongebob,0
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.,not spongebob,0
"What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?",not spongebob,0
"Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz!",spongebob,1
"Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?",not spongebob,0
Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.,not spongebob,0
Let's show him,spongebob,1
"You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons.,not spongebob,0
"Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?,spongebob,1
"Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut.",not spongebob,0
I see what you mean.,spongebob,1
Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?,not spongebob,0
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.,spongebob,1
"Secret formula, here I come.",not spongebob,0
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.,spongebob,1
"Perfect. Huh?  No! No! NO! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes. Voila!",not spongebob,0
A log cabin?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art.",not spongebob,0
Everyone's a critic.,not spongebob,0
I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?",not spongebob,0
I guess I hadn't thought about that.,spongebob,1
"I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.",not spongebob,0
"See, SpongeBob? Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird.",not spongebob,0
"CAN'T YOU TWO DO ANYTHING RIGHT? I give you one simple task after another and...  Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing, life guarding, creative writing—all such bitter failures.",not spongebob,0
"Oh. It's okay, little green... creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest  restaurant in Bikini Bottom!",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating!",spongebob,1
"Oh, goodbye, paintbrush.  Hello, antique fitting!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.",not spongebob,0
Hup-hup-hup-hup!  Hup-hup-hup-hup!,not spongebob,0
"I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No. No tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula is — one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe travel size. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!! Yaaagh!!!  Huh!? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHUM BUCKET?!?!?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.",not spongebob,0
I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation.,spongebob,1
And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!/Yay!,not spongebob,0
"And I bet you tried to steal this, too.",not spongebob,0
"Hehehhehheh... well, steal is such a strong word.",not spongebob,0
You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. Do ya?,not spongebob,0
Now stay away from me...,not spongebob,0
"...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors. Heh-yah!  Ahhhhhhhhhhh.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.",not spongebob,0
"Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day.",not spongebob,0
"Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?",not spongebob,0
"That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.",not spongebob,0
And these metal decorations?,not spongebob,0
Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.,not spongebob,0
And the computer?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's Plankton's wife.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.",not spongebob,0
But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's true—it is pretty classy in here. Gimme four!",not spongebob,0
"And how was your meal today, ma'am?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.",not spongebob,0
I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's the way you want it.",not spongebob,0
Wait! I have an idea!,spongebob,1
Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.",spongebob,1
"My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough! Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community.",not spongebob,0
Community!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I really hope people like it!",not spongebob,0
Great!,not spongebob,0
Super good!,not spongebob,0
Number 1 with a star!,not spongebob,0
"See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.",spongebob,1
Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!,not spongebob,0
Let's see what other nice people are saying.,spongebob,1
What are you shrieking about?,not spongebob,0
Nothing! I just love to shriek!,spongebob,1
"Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!",not spongebob,0
"When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside! P-Star7. Ouch!",not spongebob,0
Not on my bulletin board!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.",spongebob,1
"Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.",spongebob,1
"Huh? Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted. Signed, Guybesideu3?",spongebob,1
"Huh?  Dumb-blurted! LOL!?, What's the Point?, I could make a better patty out of mud?! Where are all these notes coming from?",spongebob,1
"Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!",not spongebob,0
I want to express the worst side of myself!,not spongebob,0
"Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!",not spongebob,0
Huh?  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.,spongebob,1
Hello!,not spongebob,0
P-Star7 is my new hero.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's me!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, right.",not spongebob,0
He really knows how to complain.,not spongebob,0
But I wasn't com...,not spongebob,0
P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.",not spongebob,0
"You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it real. He's a true hero for our troubled times.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.",spongebob,1
"No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.",spongebob,1
"No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.",spongebob,1
Now it's smaller than that one!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?,spongebob,1
"Oh, he responded hours ago.",not spongebob,0
"Well, why didn't you tell me?",spongebob,1
Because I don't care.,not spongebob,0
"That's for me! Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139! Cordially, P-Star7.",spongebob,1
His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why did you have to say that?",spongebob,1
"You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead.  Signed, HandsomeLad42.",not spongebob,0
"You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!",spongebob,1
"Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.",not spongebob,0
I brought a bag lunch.,not spongebob,0
What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!,not spongebob,0
Why would we buy food from a place that quote  Smells like stinky armpits?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's not true!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's on the board.",not spongebob,0
And the board is never wrong.,not spongebob,0
And does anyone need to buy a pen?,not spongebob,0
How about some paper?,not spongebob,0
What's wrong?,not spongebob,0
It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I think they were all good things.",not spongebob,0
Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.,spongebob,1
"Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.",not spongebob,0
No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.,spongebob,1
You were Fry-Banshee?!,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...",not spongebob,0
He said that?!,spongebob,1
"Oh, not yet!",not spongebob,0
"Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!",not spongebob,0
He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.",spongebob,1
"Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!",not spongebob,0
You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!,spongebob,1
You smell!,not spongebob,0
One of your eyes is too big!,not spongebob,0
Close your mouth when you eat!?,not spongebob,0
"Oh!  This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp! Oh, Daddy!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register. P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yokels understand I'm working here? Ironically!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.",not spongebob,0
"I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!",not spongebob,0
"People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!",spongebob,1
"Okay, that's it! Everybody out!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.",spongebob,1
We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!,not spongebob,0
A lesson in polite manners.,spongebob,1
Or we could push him off a cliff.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!",spongebob,1
"Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.",spongebob,1
"This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?",not spongebob,0
"Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.",spongebob,1
I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!,not spongebob,0
Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.,not spongebob,0
So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.,spongebob,1
"Surprise, P-Star7!",spongebob,1
Patrick?!,not spongebob,0
I'll tear ya to pieces!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're P-Star7?",spongebob,1
"Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.",not spongebob,0
"So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I think.",not spongebob,0
"You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, ratfish!",not spongebob,0
Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn?,spongebob,1
"Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.,not spongebob,0
"Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?",spongebob,1
"Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine.",not spongebob,0
Time off?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this... SpongeBob, take a vacation.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, that went better than expected.",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.",spongebob,1
I thought you were on vacation.,not spongebob,0
"He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.",not spongebob,0
What's a vacation?,spongebob,1
"Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.",not spongebob,0
No work?! But what'll I do all day?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.",not spongebob,0
But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.,spongebob,1
Nor will I.,not spongebob,0
That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.",not spongebob,0
"Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.",not spongebob,0
Replacement?,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
That's enough banter on my dime.,not spongebob,0
"Ok, boss.",not spongebob,0
"Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job.",not spongebob,0
"Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.",not spongebob,0
I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!",spongebob,1
"Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.",not spongebob,0
"I'm not here to see you, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?",not spongebob,0
I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.,spongebob,1
"Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.",not spongebob,0
"You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, it's not what you think.",spongebob,1
"Out you go, boy.",not spongebob,0
But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.",spongebob,1
"I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.",spongebob,1
"Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.",not spongebob,0
"I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.",spongebob,1
"Huh? What's the big idea, here?",not spongebob,0
"Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, shhh.",spongebob,1
It talks!,not spongebob,0
"Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.",spongebob,1
"Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Not a problem at all, me boy.",not spongebob,0
"Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.",spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"My house is back that way, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
"Far out, little man. Far out.",not spongebob,0
Where'd you say you were taking me?,spongebob,1
"Look, boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!",not spongebob,0
"It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!",spongebob,1
"Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? Is that you?,not spongebob,0
"I've been waiting for you, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!",not spongebob,0
What’ll be?,not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
One shell on a shingle.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.",spongebob,1
"Why'd you do it, laddy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!",spongebob,1
"You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.",not spongebob,0
You must've saved a fortune.,spongebob,1
"Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.",not spongebob,0
Wow! That's more than I make in a year.,spongebob,1
Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.,not spongebob,0
Yippee! I happily acquiesce.,spongebob,1
"Once around the roundabout.  Left at the wall.  Over the Bump of Truth.  And finally, the flaming hoop!  Thank you, Mrs. Puff, I am now a car daring figure and a producing member of society.  Woo-hoo! Yeah!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test.  Mrs. Puff, you okay?",spongebob,1
Just start driving.  Turn this boat around immediately!,not spongebob,0
"Right away, ma’am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control...",spongebob,1
"Next up, Goin' Bananas 3: In 3D.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, dude, pass the 3D glasses. This is supposed to be, like, in 3D.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, right!",not spongebob,0
Here I am! I'm coming at ya like your worst nightmare!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"I think it's safe to say you have once again, failed your driving test!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-",spongebob,1
"No buts, SpongeBob! You fail this test over and over! I'm beginning to think you are simply... unteachable!  Now, get out of my sight!",not spongebob,0
"I...I...  I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!",spongebob,1
"Dude, this is, like, the gnarliest 3-D movie ever!",not spongebob,0
"If only SpongeBob could pass his boating test, he'd be out of my life once and for all. Unfortunately, I keep getting reminded of the consequences if I get too angry with the little nuisance.  I can't even leave town without violating my parole.  If there was only some way that I didn't have to live in fear.  Fear! That's the answer! SpongeBob is afraid of the driving course! So it would stand to reason that if he took the driving test somewhere else besides the driving course, he would pass!  Of course! The answer's been in front of me all along! I'll test SpongeBob on a real road and then he'll be out of my life forever!  Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?",not spongebob,0
"Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth?  Come back later; I'm wallowing.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that! Let's forget what I said. It's time to take a fresh approach.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un-",spongebob,1
"We don't have time for this, SpongeBob. We have a long day of driving ahead of us.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?",spongebob,1
"To overcome your fears, silly.",not spongebob,0
It's not working!,spongebob,1
Here we are!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, where are we?",spongebob,1
This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.,not spongebob,0
Dr-iving test?!,spongebob,1
"That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course.  Out here, there's nothing but the road.  Now, scooch over.  Come on. Scooch over.",not spongebob,0
"But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?",spongebob,1
"Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!",spongebob,1
"Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Got it?",not spongebob,0
"O-o-okay.  Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff.",spongebob,1
Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.,not spongebob,0
"Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road.",spongebob,1
Boating within the lines.  Well done.,not spongebob,0
Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1

Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1
"Roundabout navigation, check!",not spongebob,0
"Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!",spongebob,1
"Safe and steady acceleration, check!",not spongebob,0
Focus on the road...  There is nothing but the road.,spongebob,1
"First, he drives on what looks like a mobius strip. Then he drives over a road with another SpongeBob under it. Then, he drives up a curvy road with a SpongeBob like face, which swallows the boat. The camera pans upward to a Saturn-like planet, and SpongeBob jumps out of the planet and drives along its ringlike road. The rings break and SpongeBob flies into the screen, acting like he's in a trance. The same goes with the boat driving into the screen, SpongeBob's head is at the bow. The boat drives around the inside of another SpongeBob, while at a real-life road. Finally, a skull rises, SpongeBob's mouth is in its eye sockets. Its road-tongue rolls out, and SpongeBob skates out, wearing boats as rollerskates. He jumps off, spins, and falls. Cut back to Mrs. Puff in reality]",not spongebob,0
Check...check...and...CHECK!  What is this?!,not spongebob,0
Safely dock vessel],not spongebob,0
"Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel.",not spongebob,0

"Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!",not spongebob,0
"Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!",spongebob,1
Just stop the boat!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh...  The road!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, wait!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBoooob!,not spongebob,0
That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? This isn't just any road.  It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway!,not spongebob,0
Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!,spongebob,1

Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers.,not spongebob,0

"Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look!  No!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, hit the brakes!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh! Okay!,spongebob,1
"Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license!  And I'm free! Ha ha!",not spongebob,0
I don't think so.,not spongebob,0
"Is there a problem, officer?",not spongebob,0
"Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am,  are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that.",not spongebob,0

"I am a culinary genius, no?  Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward.  Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish.  Stay warm, my little Squidy.  Le oww!  Typical, I always forget something.",not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
A sea bunny?,not spongebob,0

My roast à la Squidward!,not spongebob,0
What the—,not spongebob,0
Oof!,not spongebob,0
I declare war on bunnies!,not spongebob,0
I am going to bury that bunny!,not spongebob,0
"Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!",not spongebob,0
Did you have to catch him that easily?,not spongebob,0

A sock?,not spongebob,0
"Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!",spongebob,1

Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent.  Ding!  And talent equals money!",not spongebob,0
I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!,spongebob,1
"Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.",not spongebob,0
Why'd you do that?,spongebob,1
"In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.",spongebob,1
Nonsense. You're a born performer.  Ooh!  Here.  You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm? Uh...  Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!",not spongebob,0
I can't! I've got stage fright!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!",not spongebob,0
There he is!  ChefBob!  Me little star!  Break a leg. Break two legs.,not spongebob,0
My leg!,not spongebob,0
"Shut up, Fred!  Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!",not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's just wrong!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?  Huh? Oh!",spongebob,1
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
I guess I am.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob!  Your order, please!",not spongebob,0
The little ChefBob is a sensation.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
We are!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!",not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,not spongebob,0
Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.",not spongebob,0
"Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping!",not spongebob,0
D-did I say that? I didn't say that.,spongebob,1
"Hey, do me! Insult me!",not spongebob,0
"Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
That was a good one.,not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh!,not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.",spongebob,1
Me next!  Shoot me a zinger!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that.  I don't speak goober!",not spongebob,0
I love it! Guilty as charged!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.",not spongebob,0
"Ho, ho, ho, ho!  Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, what's this, here?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.",spongebob,1
"Oh-ho, does he?  Fresh cut seaweed.  A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand? What?  A bigger dressing room?",not spongebob,0
"In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.",not spongebob,0
Blubber Boy?!  No way!,not spongebob,0
"What's the matter, Krabs?  You don't like money?",not spongebob,0
What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes.,not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?",spongebob,1
Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.",spongebob,1
"ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.",not spongebob,0
"Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.",not spongebob,0
"Let me make it up to ya!  Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.",not spongebob,0
"I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!",spongebob,1
That's even more insulting.,not spongebob,0
"Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Not funny!,not spongebob,0
He scores!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!",not spongebob,0
Have a drink!,not spongebob,0
"No, no!",not spongebob,0
En garde!,spongebob,1
"Me customers!  Alright, enough of this.",not spongebob,0
"ChefBob, you are hereby fired!  Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?",not spongebob,0
Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!,not spongebob,0
I learned a very valuable lesson today.,spongebob,1
To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?,not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, that, but  mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer.",spongebob,1
Ow.,spongebob,1
"What is it, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"What is it, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
It's—it's alive!,not spongebob,0
"And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?",not spongebob,0
"Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?",not spongebob,0
"Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!",not spongebob,0
It's here!,not spongebob,0
"Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops.",spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!",spongebob,1
Let me try!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry.",not spongebob,0
"You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out.",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Onward... to Squidward's house.,spongebob,1
Go away!,not spongebob,0
"To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?",spongebob,1
They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.,not spongebob,0
Who?,spongebob,1
"My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?",spongebob,1
It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut.",spongebob,1
What's it saying?,not spongebob,0
"It says... It's dark in here. Got anything else, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a nice, hot frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!",not spongebob,0
"So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine.",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure.",not spongebob,0
"We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!",spongebob,1
What'll we do?,not spongebob,0
"They're looking for an invention, right?",spongebob,1
Right.,not spongebob,0
So let's start inventing!,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"It's time to get serious, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.,not spongebob,0
"That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.",not spongebob,0
"Light bulb, already invented.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.",not spongebob,0
"That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.",spongebob,1
Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea.",not spongebob,0
Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.,spongebob,1
"♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪",not spongebob,0
"I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.",spongebob,1
Who?,not spongebob,0
Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!,spongebob,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,not spongebob,0
"Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade.",not spongebob,0
At your service.,not spongebob,0
And this is Lord Reginald.,not spongebob,0
Charmed.,not spongebob,0
You guys talk funny. Say more words!,not spongebob,0
"We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.",not spongebob,0
"Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!",spongebob,1
And I used to be dumb.,not spongebob,0
Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?,not spongebob,0
My name is SpongeBob.,spongebob,1
And I am Professor Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Professor?,spongebob,1
Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.,not spongebob,0
Where is Miss Cheeks?,not spongebob,0
She should be back any moment.,spongebob,1
I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!,not spongebob,0
"Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?",spongebob,1
Good idea.,not spongebob,0
Well?,spongebob,1
"Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work.",not spongebob,0
"Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!",spongebob,1
This is where our research money went?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!,spongebob,1
"An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, how do we know this contraption works?",not spongebob,0
Let's see a demonstration.,not spongebob,0
Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.,not spongebob,0
Me?  Are you sure this is safe?,not spongebob,0
As sure as I'm a doctor professor.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't you think we should test it?",spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
That's not exactly what I had in mind!,spongebob,1
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh I say, this is splendid.  Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this?  Oh marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.",not spongebob,0
"Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, lowly assistant.",not spongebob,0
"Oh I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!",not spongebob,0
Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.,spongebob,1
"Now it's tuning my ukulele!  Ouch! I say, was that necessary?  You sir, are impertinent.  Oh, dear.",not spongebob,0
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?  Um sorry, was that a yes?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?",not spongebob,0
It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!,not spongebob,0
Oh I really wish Sandy were here.,spongebob,1
All aboard!,not spongebob,0
Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?,not spongebob,0
"It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg.",not spongebob,0
What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?!,not spongebob,0
Sandy!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?!,not spongebob,0
Ouch.,not spongebob,0
It works! It works!,not spongebob,0
"Lord Reginald, are you all right?",not spongebob,0
I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.,not spongebob,0
We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.,not spongebob,0
"Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.",spongebob,1
"I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Don't push it.,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.",not spongebob,0
"My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels.  Good gracious! Can it be?",not spongebob,0
Try it again.,not spongebob,0
Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!,not spongebob,0
"Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.",not spongebob,0
"It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.",not spongebob,0
I accept.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.",not spongebob,0
Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.,not spongebob,0
"Now, now, one miracle at a time.",not spongebob,0
Goodbye!,not spongebob,0
"Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.",not spongebob,0
My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, mailman!",spongebob,1
"Okay,  see you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?",not spongebob,0
"Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!",spongebob,1
"That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!,spongebob,1
"This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!",spongebob,1
This guy's got shoes!,not spongebob,0
"Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?",spongebob,1
They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.,not spongebob,0
What kind of things?,spongebob,1
How should I know? Things people wanna buy.  Now keep your paws off my mail.,not spongebob,0
"That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!",spongebob,1
Is that gonna hurt?,not spongebob,0
"Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?",spongebob,1
Uh...  More time for thinking.,not spongebob,0
"No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.",spongebob,1
A chocolate bar?,not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!",spongebob,1
"Fancy living, here we come!",spongebob,1
Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.",spongebob,1
"Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?",spongebob,1
"Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. With or without nuts?",not spongebob,0
Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step!  Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?",spongebob,1
"Chocolate bars, eh?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!",spongebob,1
Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!,not spongebob,0
"No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, most certainly, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Well,  no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these!",not spongebob,0
Wow... what is it?,spongebob,1
"It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!",not spongebob,0
"But, I'm wasting my time.  You don't need these bags.",not spongebob,0
We need 'em! We need 'em!,not spongebob,0
"So long, boys! Happy hunting!  Suckers...",not spongebob,0
"Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!",not spongebob,0
Let's try next door!,spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?",spongebob,1
I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags.,not spongebob,0
We'll take twenty!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?",not spongebob,0
We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?,spongebob,1
That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.,not spongebob,0
"One chocolate bar, coming up!",spongebob,1
I don't have time for this.,not spongebob,0
I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice—,spongebob,1
Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
"—lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.",spongebob,1
Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!,not spongebob,0
"No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?",spongebob,1
He said we were mediocre...,not spongebob,0
That's it! He made us feel special!,spongebob,1
"Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, Patrick!",spongebob,1
Why don't we try being nice?,spongebob,1
"Oh, okay.",not spongebob,0
"Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
I love you.,not spongebob,0
"I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.",spongebob,1
Please. G-Go away!,not spongebob,0
"Um,  H-H-How you doin'?",spongebob,1
How am I doing?,not spongebob,0
Wanna buy some chocolate?,spongebob,1
We got him now!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?",not spongebob,0
"Hee hee, it tickles!",not spongebob,0
"As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.",not spongebob,0
You can keep that for five bucks.,not spongebob,0
I'll take ten!,not spongebob,0
We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Let's shake on it.,spongebob,1
Did you say something?,not spongebob,0
"Remember, Patrick, focus.",spongebob,1
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.",spongebob,1
Why is Chubby here staring at me?,not spongebob,0
Focusing.,not spongebob,0
"Back up, Jack!",not spongebob,0
Nice place you got in here.,not spongebob,0
I can't understand what were doing wrong.,spongebob,1
I can't understand anything.,not spongebob,0
"There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!",spongebob,1
"Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.",not spongebob,0
They are most certainly not delicious!,spongebob,1
Not the way I use them!,not spongebob,0
Yet they sell millions of bags a day!,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!",spongebob,1
Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
"We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!",spongebob,1
The kill!,not spongebob,0
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, young lady.",spongebob,1
We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?,spongebob,1
Mom!,not spongebob,0
"What, what, what's all the yelling?",not spongebob,0
"You just can't wait for me to die, can you?",not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolate.,not spongebob,0
Chocolate?,not spongebob,0

"What, what are they selling?",not spongebob,0
Chocolates!,not spongebob,0

Chocolates!,not spongebob,0
I can't hear you!,not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolates!,not spongebob,0
They're selling chocolate?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.",not spongebob,0
I always hated it!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...",spongebob,1
You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.,not spongebob,0
"Live forever, you say? I'll take one.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, you lazy Mary!  Start rubbing me with that chocolate!",not spongebob,0
I hate you.,not spongebob,0
"If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!",spongebob,1
Hooray for lying!,not spongebob,0
It'll make your hair grow.,spongebob,1
Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!,not spongebob,0
They'll make you sound smart.,spongebob,1
I'll take twenty!,not spongebob,0
It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.,not spongebob,0
Just in time.,not spongebob,0
They'll make you fly!,spongebob,1
You'll fall in love!,not spongebob,0
They'll bring world peace!,spongebob,1
You'll walk through walls!,not spongebob,0
You'll rule the world!,spongebob,1
This'll be the best lie yet!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!",spongebob,1
What can I do for you boys?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
Small world. What's the matter with you guys?,not spongebob,0
"Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.",spongebob,1
"Ah, some guys have all the luck.",not spongebob,0
"I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.",not spongebob,0
"At night,  I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no...",not spongebob,0
Ow...,not spongebob,0
"Quick, Patrick, let's help him!",spongebob,1
"Careful, put him down gently.",spongebob,1
Ow...!,not spongebob,0
"Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?",spongebob,1
"Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars.",not spongebob,0
"Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!",not spongebob,0
"Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.",spongebob,1
"Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.",spongebob,1
I can live with that.,not spongebob,0
Let's change our names to Why and Bother.,spongebob,1
Chocolate!,not spongebob,0
No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...,spongebob,1
No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!,not spongebob,0
Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you...  I'd like to buy all your chocolate.,not spongebob,0
Thank you for your patronage.,spongebob,1
"Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.",spongebob,1
But what are we going to spend it on?,not spongebob,0
"Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.",not spongebob,0
"But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs  and their dates.",not spongebob,0
"So, how long have you two ladies known each other?",spongebob,1
What? What did he say?,not spongebob,0
"And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate.",not spongebob,0
"Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho.  Oh! Hi.  I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club!  Hey, that's better!",not spongebob,0
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Potty! It is Christmas.  And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year.  Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now!",not spongebob,0
I sure am!  I'm ready!,spongebob,1
"Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae.  And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating.  I too am also preparing for Christmas.  Hmm, unbaked cookie dough!  Mmm...",not spongebob,0
Potty want cookie dough!  Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Potty! No!,not spongebob,0
Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Get out of here!,not spongebob,0
Cookie!,not spongebob,0
Potty!,not spongebob,0
Give us a lick!,not spongebob,0
"Back off, you flying freak!",not spongebob,0
Clarify please.,not spongebob,0

"Nice try, tiny cyclops, you won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily. But, preparation cannot be rushed, each batch much simmer for exactly 24 hours.",not spongebob,0
24 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Who took my blue blanky!?  Huh, this is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising.",not spongebob,0
Oh just taste it already!,not spongebob,0
"Well the smell doesn't make me wretch.  Hey, that ain't bad at all!  It's actually amazing!  This is gold in the form of chum!  Squidward my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star.",not spongebob,0
A star.,not spongebob,0
A star.,not spongebob,0
"Hello hungry eaters, it's time for, Flavors of the Bottom, a delectable at dining out at Bikini Bottom,  look with your host Perch Perkins!",not spongebob,0
"Hey all you bottom feeders! If you already eaten, well you might want to make room for seconds!   Cause' we are tasting Bikini Bottom's new upscale eatery, Le' Chum Bucket.  Look at all those classy diners. What's on the menu? It's called, Chum Fricassee.  Earlier, I spoke to head chef Squidward Tentacles. He shared with us why it's such a, Frica-success!",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I can't share the recipe with you, it's a secret.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"That's right Krabs , now we have a secret formula, and it's a bottle, and you can't have it!",not spongebob,0
"Give me that, please.  Thank you.",not spongebob,0
Secret!,not spongebob,0
"Shhhh , what's gotten into you?!  High fo-looting customers don't bark on the top of their lungs like a sea dog!",not spongebob,0
Reservation?! In this sinkhole?!,not spongebob,0
"What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well,  if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you.  Bon Appetit, Suckers!  See you in two years!",not spongebob,0
There's a two-year wait for a table.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, see how you like it Krabs!",not spongebob,0
One week later...,not spongebob,0
I was here first!,not spongebob,0
"No, I was!",not spongebob,0
"One at a time, please.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Tentacles, it's so nice to finally meet you!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, what's up?",not spongebob,0
Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!,not spongebob,0
What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours.,not spongebob,0
I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!,not spongebob,0
But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say.,not spongebob,0
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I will.  Please, sir. Take my chum. It's the least I can do to help. Poor guys.",not spongebob,0
"You go first, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is great!",spongebob,1
Better than a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
A what?,spongebob,1
This is delicious! No! I'm ruined!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world-famous Fricassee.  Grandma!",not spongebob,0
Someone's been cooking my recipe  and they're doing it wrong!,not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
Saving my recipe from my bumbling grandson!,not spongebob,0
"Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him!",not spongebob,0
"What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I admit it! I admit it! But--but what's the big deal?  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"The big deal is when the chum is not cooked for exactly 24 hours, it causes severe tummy trouble!",not spongebob,0
"You fed us, undercooked chum?!",not spongebob,0
"Tear him apart, people!",not spongebob,0
I've had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore!,not spongebob,0
Not the napkins!,not spongebob,0
"He got what he deserves, that's what I say!  It's on fire! It's all burning! Run!",not spongebob,0
My restaurant!,not spongebob,0
My fan base!,not spongebob,0
"I hope you learned your lesson, genius!",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all.",spongebob,1
"I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!",not spongebob,0
Ow!  Living the dream!,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?",not spongebob,0
I like neither. Can I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?",not spongebob,0
No. What will you have?,not spongebob,0
"Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?",not spongebob,0
"Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
"Psst, try the coral bits.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.",not spongebob,0
That'll be one dollar.,not spongebob,0
What's going on?,not spongebob,0
"Something stupid, I'm sure.",not spongebob,0
Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!,not spongebob,0
See? I told you.,not spongebob,0
What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!",not spongebob,0
A very dirty dollar?,not spongebob,0
"No, this is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir, you have just given me my one millionth dollar!",not spongebob,0
"Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing, now get out.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, what?",not spongebob,0
"Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar.",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, a trip!",spongebob,1
"I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where are we going? Fancy Springs?",not spongebob,0
No...,not spongebob,0
Pamper Island?,not spongebob,0
Try again...,not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Oh! Bikini Bottom Folk Village?,not spongebob,0
Better than that!,not spongebob,0
...clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?,not spongebob,0
"Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?",not spongebob,0
No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.,not spongebob,0
"Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?",spongebob,1
How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?,not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Hey, watch where you're swinging that!  SpongeBob, be careful with tha-   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, I've had enough...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose.  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya.  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, you stinking bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Here she comes...  ...she made it!,spongebob,1
"For a second or two, I thought she was a goner!",not spongebob,0
"So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back.  Never, never, never, never, never!",not spongebob,0
I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.,spongebob,1
"Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!",not spongebob,0
"You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious.  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, captain!",spongebob,1
"And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary.",spongebob,1
"We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar.  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get ya.",spongebob,1
"Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!  Look what we've got!",not spongebob,0
"Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon,  and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.",not spongebob,0
"Actually, it's Coral Blue number t-",spongebob,1
"I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.",not spongebob,0
"No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.",not spongebob,0
I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.,not spongebob,0
You're kidding?,not spongebob,0
Woo! Is it another fishing trip?,spongebob,1
No. It's this sandwich.,not spongebob,0
A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?,not spongebob,0
Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever, we've got plenty more to-  ...eat.",not spongebob,0
"Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!?",not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,spongebob,1
Just look at him!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you-",spongebob,1
Look again.,not spongebob,0
You're right. How do we get outta here?,spongebob,1
"If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. It's just a dumb old dollar! Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you.  Live bait.",not spongebob,0
"You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he'll come.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!  Get us out of here!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar...!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives.  Why couldn't it have been me?!",spongebob,1
"Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!",not spongebob,0
"Why did he have to go like this, why?!",spongebob,1
Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!,not spongebob,0
"Hello, boys!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?,not spongebob,0
"Wow, how did you get it back?",spongebob,1
"It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter, so eventually, we settled on a trade.",not spongebob,0
What did you give him?,spongebob,1
Nothing important.,not spongebob,0
"There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go.",not spongebob,0
"Wey, wook. It's Widward!",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Widward's woing to work.,spongebob,1
Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?,not spongebob,0
What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?,not spongebob,0
We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!",spongebob,1
"Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!",not spongebob,0
What did he say?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Something about his nose?,spongebob,1
"Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!",not spongebob,0
"Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!",not spongebob,0
That's what we've been trying to tell you!,not spongebob,0
We've been stuck up here for three days.,spongebob,1
We told you you wouldn't fit in.,not spongebob,0
"Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Ready!,not spongebob,0
Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!,not spongebob,0
"SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club!",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Make a wish, honey.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!",not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-T?!",not spongebob,0
"Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.",not spongebob,0
Well... this is the end.,not spongebob,0
"No it's not, Squidward!",spongebob,1
It's not?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!",spongebob,1
"And besides, we have this!",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!,not spongebob,0
"Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?",spongebob,1
Maybe someday.,not spongebob,0
Oooohhhh!,not spongebob,0
You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.",spongebob,1
The shell knows all!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?",spongebob,1
Nothing.,not spongebob,0
The shell has spoken!,not spongebob,0
Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!,not spongebob,0
I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!,not spongebob,0
"All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!!  I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!!  Ohhh, there's no way out of here...  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing.  As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky!",not spongebob,0
DUDE! We're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load!,not spongebob,0
Praise the Magic Conch!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.",not spongebob,0
It's a gift from the Magic Conch.,spongebob,1
"Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
Umm...uh..yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Once a member, always a member!",spongebob,1
To the club!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?",not spongebob,0
"Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.",spongebob,1
Maybe he's not a brother.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?",not spongebob,0
Neither.,not spongebob,0
Oh. Then how about the soup?,not spongebob,0
I don't think so.,not spongebob,0
Could I have anything to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm...  Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?",not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"All right!  Sorry, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Give me that!  Could I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Could I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Could I have something to eat!?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Can't you say anything else but no?!,not spongebob,0
Try asking again.,not spongebob,0
Can I have something to eat?,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you all right?",spongebob,1
Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.,not spongebob,0
Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?!  Do you folks need some help?,not spongebob,0
I'm saved!  You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!,not spongebob,0
Magic... Conch... Shell?  You mean like this?!,not spongebob,0
The Magic Conch! A club member!,not spongebob,0
Uhhbuuuhhh...,not spongebob,0
My conch told me to come save you guys.,not spongebob,0
Hooray for the magic conches!,not spongebob,0

"Maybe I'll do a cute little button.  Or something a bit more manly perhaps.  Upturned might be good, too.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Great.  The idiot found me.,not spongebob,0
Whatcha doing?,spongebob,1
I'm picking a nose.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out.",spongebob,1
"I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with.",not spongebob,0
"But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a...  Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?",spongebob,1
With you? Absolutely not.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, come on, Squidward.  I can get you there lickety-split.",spongebob,1
"You can't dump your garbage here, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in.",spongebob,1
"Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out.",not spongebob,0
"You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon.",not spongebob,0
Ah. This is nice.,not spongebob,0
"Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home.",spongebob,1
Five minutes later...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help.",spongebob,1
I love you.,not spongebob,0
The bed is fine!,not spongebob,0
Fluff your pillow?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Fluff your IV bag?,spongebob,1
"Enough, you buffoon!",not spongebob,0
"Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful.",spongebob,1
"If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve.",spongebob,1
"Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—",spongebob,1
Grab a uniform out of the closet.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo!  Ooh! Candy stripes.  Strawberry.",spongebob,1
"Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here.",not spongebob,0
We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.,not spongebob,0
And what seems to be the problem today?,not spongebob,0
My throat hurts.,not spongebob,0
"Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?",not spongebob,0
"Wait a second! I think I've seen this before.  Mm, yeah.  Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken.",spongebob,1
"Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better.",not spongebob,0
"You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, doc.",not spongebob,0
"No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help.",spongebob,1
"What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?",not spongebob,0
So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—",not spongebob,0
Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time.  Ah!,spongebob,1

"Thanks, doc.",not spongebob,0
"Ready, set.",spongebob,1
"And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?",not spongebob,0
"Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
No! Not you!  What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine.",spongebob,1
You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.,not spongebob,0
Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Help me!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0

Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.,not spongebob,0
So awesome.,not spongebob,0
We were on our way to perform a surgery...,not spongebob,0

Order up!,spongebob,1
Yow! That shouldn't be in there.  Ooh!,spongebob,1
What?  Oh.,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"Nurse, sponge.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, nurse.",spongebob,1
I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!,not spongebob,0
I still can't see.,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse.",spongebob,1
What—what happened?,not spongebob,0
"I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!",not spongebob,0
"Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!",spongebob,1
"Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—",not spongebob,0
No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No-o-o-o!,not spongebob,0
"Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—",not spongebob,0
How's about the Squidward Classic?,spongebob,1
"Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it.",spongebob,1
D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work.,spongebob,1
But you're a doctor. You're at work.,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm just a fry cook.  But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye!",spongebob,1
Fry cook? Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market.",not spongebob,0
Sure is a nice day for a picnic.,not spongebob,0
Oh Herb! It's like a second honeymoon!,not spongebob,0
Just look at Timmy and Sally throwing the old disc around!,not spongebob,0
"C'mon and throw it, sis!",not spongebob,0
I just wanna say I'm gonna be real sad when you go off to college.,not spongebob,0
"Oh Sally, don't be such a goop! (SpongeBob appears, tears in his eyes) You know... I'll always be your big brother!",not spongebob,0
Is it starting to rain?,not spongebob,0
Nothing can spoil this perfect day!,not spongebob,0
What's the matter big brother got something in your eye?,not spongebob,0
Yeah... that's it... that must be it...,not spongebob,0
"Ha haw, now who's the goof? Just watch out because here it comes!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...",not spongebob,0
"PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!",not spongebob,0
I smell something burning.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. Probably my eye.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
You missed a spot.,not spongebob,0
"What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.",spongebob,1
"Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.",not spongebob,0
"Like what, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!",not spongebob,0
At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.,spongebob,1
"Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.",spongebob,1
Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!",not spongebob,0
Maybe Pete is just tired.,spongebob,1
"Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-",spongebob,1
No! Not his productivity!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!",spongebob,1
No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!,not spongebob,0
Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!,spongebob,1
Company picnic?,not spongebob,0
"See, look! He's already perking up!",spongebob,1
"Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?",not spongebob,0
Definitely!,spongebob,1
What's going on in here?,not spongebob,0
"Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!",not spongebob,0
"A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.",not spongebob,0
This is the greatest company picnic ever?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes it is.",not spongebob,0
"Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.",spongebob,1
Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.",not spongebob,0
Here's one!,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.",not spongebob,0
Right you are! Here's the food!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.",not spongebob,0
"Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Going long!,spongebob,1
"Ho, ho. This is so much fun.",not spongebob,0
Is this far enough?,spongebob,1
I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.",not spongebob,0
I'm going home.,not spongebob,0
Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!,not spongebob,0
"Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!",spongebob,1
"Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.",spongebob,1
"Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, This was the greatest...",not spongebob,0
Do not say it!,not spongebob,0
The greatest comp...,not spongebob,0
Don't!,not spongebob,0
The greatest company picnic ever!,not spongebob,0
"Well, looks like we've got company.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic.",spongebob,1
"Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.",not spongebob,0
I have? Wait. Oh yeah.,not spongebob,0
Chumpany Picnic? That's not how you spell Company Picnic!,not spongebob,0
Guess who?,not spongebob,0
Plankton!,not spongebob,0

"Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!",not spongebob,0
Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
You don't even have any employees!,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
Sure I do.,not spongebob,0
"Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.",not spongebob,0
A real disk?,spongebob,1
"Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!",not spongebob,0
Well. Eh.,spongebob,1
You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?",spongebob,1
"Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.",not spongebob,0
"The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...",not spongebob,0
Delicacies?,not spongebob,0
"And of course, the dunking booth!",not spongebob,0
Have you seen the calliope?,not spongebob,0
Aww!,spongebob,1
"Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...",not spongebob,0
"One side, Goopy!",not spongebob,0
Yum.,spongebob,1
"Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either.",not spongebob,0
"You were saying, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?",not spongebob,0
"Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
You want me to paint your face?,spongebob,1
"Well, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
"Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.",spongebob,1
Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.,not spongebob,0
Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!,not spongebob,0
"You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?",not spongebob,0
No. Course not.,spongebob,1
Are you sure you don't want to?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!",spongebob,1
You sure?,not spongebob,0
"100% sure, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!",not spongebob,0
You can never have too many!,not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squiddie-bird!",not spongebob,0
Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!,spongebob,1
It's a paper plate. Whoo!,spongebob,1
"Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.",spongebob,1
"I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...",not spongebob,0
"Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.",not spongebob,0
Ooh!  Me first! Me first!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.",not spongebob,0
That's such great advice!,not spongebob,0
"This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more!",not spongebob,0
"Ahem! Hello, Plankton!",spongebob,1
Uh oh.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!",spongebob,1
My candied pen!,not spongebob,0
"Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!",spongebob,1
No!,spongebob,1
Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...,spongebob,1
I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?,not spongebob,0
Whew! That was a cl...,not spongebob,0
"You saved me, boy. How did you do it?",not spongebob,0
"I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Unbelievable!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh.,not spongebob,0
The greatest company picnic ever!,spongebob,1
"Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work!",not spongebob,0
"More fruit punch, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"You know, Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?,spongebob,1
Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.,not spongebob,0
How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?,spongebob,1
Just lay face-down and keep still.,not spongebob,0
Alright. Party's over. Go home!,not spongebob,0
Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.,spongebob,1
"No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Nah! I feel fine!,spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
"Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!",spongebob,1
"You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off.  Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say Secret formula?",not spongebob,0
Se.. Se... for mama.,not spongebob,0
Se-cret Form-ula.,not spongebob,0
Se-cret Form-ula. Secret formula!,not spongebob,0
"Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.",not spongebob,0
"My name is SpongeBob SquarePants, and I want the secret formula.",not spongebob,0
"Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait!  Just keeping track of my copy.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?! You said you would take today off.,not spongebob,0
But I feel great today.,spongebob,1
Are you sure? Because you're sweating.,not spongebob,0
But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color.",spongebob,1
Morning.,not spongebob,0
Whatever.,not spongebob,0
Morning.,spongebob,1
"I said Whatever.  Wait, didn't I just... didn't I...",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare!  Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!,not spongebob,0
I'd like to place an order for two.,not spongebob,0
"Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!",not spongebob,0
That's me: The man of your dreams.,not spongebob,0
If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything!  I really am dreaming!,not spongebob,0
"What's your name, handsome stranger?",spongebob,1
My name is SpongeBob SquarePants.,not spongebob,0
Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common!  I always wanted a twin brother!  How do you feel about bubbles?,spongebob,1
I love them!,not spongebob,0
Jelly fishing?,spongebob,1
The same thing you do.,not spongebob,0
How about Squidward?,spongebob,1
"Oh, please.",not spongebob,0
I think I'll nickname you... Me two!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can't tell you that. It's a secret. By the way, my name is Me Two.",not spongebob,0
"Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula.  Time to adjust my plan.",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.",not spongebob,0
"You are too good to us, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?",not spongebob,0
How could I forget?  You had it tattooed on my hard drive.,not spongebob,0
"Now where was I? Oh, yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA.",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"No, no, SpongeCopy. We don't put dirty, nasty things in our mouth. Spit it out. ]",not spongebob,0
Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs  and ask him for the secret formula.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, secret formula. Got it.",not spongebob,0
And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!,not spongebob,0
Got it!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Ah! SpongeCopy!,not spongebob,0
"You see, this is why I never had children.",not spongebob,0
"Yup. I'm still dreaming.  Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream?  I heard you like your patties Ground!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming!  What's that under there?",not spongebob,0
Under where?,not spongebob,0
"That's right.  ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mr. Krabs. Hey, can you tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula?",not spongebob,0
"You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.",not spongebob,0
Secret formula.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy!",not spongebob,0
"He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, no! No!",not spongebob,0
Secret formula. Secret formula. Secret formu...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look. Another handsome devil.  We'll call you Me Three  Aww. Let's go flip some patties.",spongebob,1
"Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs.  March! March, my pretties, and learn the formula!",not spongebob,0
Secret Formula. Secret Formula.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only going to tell you the secret formula one more time!",not spongebob,0
One more time!,not spongebob,0
So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.,not spongebob,0
Yay! Hooray!,not spongebob,0
They all know the formula!,not spongebob,0
Let me do that!,not spongebob,0
Okay. Thanks.,spongebob,1
Let me do that!,not spongebob,0
Sure.,spongebob,1
I'll polish the pickles.,not spongebob,0
Looks like you sponges have everything covered.,spongebob,1
Mm hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?",spongebob,1
I came from the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
The Chum Bucket?,spongebob,1
♪I'm going to know the formula! I'm going to know the formula...♪,not spongebob,0
"Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.",spongebob,1
"Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!",not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.,spongebob,1
I feel funny.,not spongebob,0
Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!,spongebob,1
I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.,not spongebob,0
What does that mean?,spongebob,1
It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!,not spongebob,0
Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't!  No! Don't disappear!,spongebob,1
"Quickly, man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!",not spongebob,0
It's easy. You take one par... I don't feel so good,not spongebob,0
"Wait, no!",not spongebob,0
Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube...,not spongebob,0
What's the formula?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.",not spongebob,0
"Geez, what a cheapskate.  I can't believe I failed again!",not spongebob,0
I can believe it.,spongebob,1
"Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you see, it's...  Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge.  I can't believe they're all gone.",spongebob,1
You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, those imitations were my friends.",spongebob,1
One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake, and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip.",spongebob,1
"Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!",not spongebob,0
"Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three, two...  OW! Right on my keys!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?!  Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Uh-uh... Yes, sir?",not spongebob,0
"There's gonna be some changes around here.  A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab!  SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?",spongebob,1
All I wanted was change for the payphone.,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!  Monsieur's change.",spongebob,1
Thanks.  Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah!  Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?",not spongebob,0
"I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?",spongebob,1
"Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.",not spongebob,0
The money?,not spongebob,0
"And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.",not spongebob,0

Going on what?,not spongebob,0
The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!,spongebob,1
What talent could you possibly possess?,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,spongebob,1
"No one, not even your parents, would want to see that.  What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.",not spongebob,0
"Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!",spongebob,1
I can hardly wait.  Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.,not spongebob,0
We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...,not spongebob,0
Wow! A full house!  There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud!,spongebob,1

"Hey, Squid! How about this for the show?  The Amazing Mister Absorbency!  Ta-da!  Ta-da!",spongebob,1
No one is going to watch you engorge yourself.,not spongebob,0
"Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!",spongebob,1
So you really want to be in the show?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes!",spongebob,1
"Okay, you get to mop up afterwards.  Now will you stop bugging me?",not spongebob,0
"So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny!",spongebob,1
"Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home.  Thank you.

He has such a way with words.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation...  ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes.  First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience.",not spongebob,0
"Nice try. Your act's over, bub.",not spongebob,0
"You may win this time. She-hah-kazing!  Well, this stinks.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!  This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!,not spongebob,0
"Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.",not spongebob,0
"For your sake, I hope you're right.",not spongebob,0
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward!",not spongebob,0
What the?!,not spongebob,0
I'm losing money on this deal!,not spongebob,0
It's worth every penny.,not spongebob,0
You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!,not spongebob,0
No talent! No talent! No talent!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?",spongebob,1

SpongeBob!  Thanks?,not spongebob,0
"Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it.  What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time.",spongebob,1

"It's okay, we'll just see the next one.",spongebob,1
I'm afraid not. That was the last showing.,not spongebob,0
"Wow. Uh, what time is it?",spongebob,1
It is one minute to midnight.,not spongebob,0
One... minute... to midnight?!,spongebob,1
But that's when the Fisherman comes out!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!",spongebob,1
The Fisherman!  '' It's midnight! The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Phew. We made it.,spongebob,1
I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.,spongebob,1
It's like we're heroes.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
"Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?",not spongebob,0
"No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door.",spongebob,1
Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead?  Do you hear that?,not spongebob,0
I think it's coming from over there.,spongebob,1
It's the Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there.  Just a few steps that away.  In the dark? All alone?",spongebob,1
"Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?",spongebob,1
Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
What is wrong with you?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Squidward.",spongebob,1
What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!,not spongebob,0
We can't get home.,not spongebob,0
We're too scared.,spongebob,1
"Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, Squidwar...",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.",spongebob,1
Hat.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Here.",spongebob,1
I told those muttonheads not to see that movie.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Are you okay?,spongebob,1
Yeah! Are you okay?,not spongebob,0
I think so! Good night!,spongebob,1
"Yeah., good night! Just don't think about the Fisherman!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!",spongebob,1
"Oh, The Fisherman. The Fisherman. Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how!  No.  No.  Um... no.  Aha!  It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman.  This is gonna be good.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, hello? Someone there?  Uh, uh? What's that?  There's something stuck...  Huh.  Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left.  Oh, yeah. All right. Right there.",not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!,not spongebob,0
"Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!",spongebob,1
Oh.  There.,not spongebob,0
Now who's here?,spongebob,1
"Uh, someone's here?",not spongebob,0
You just said.,spongebob,1
Oh. The Fisherman's here.,not spongebob,0
The Fisherman!,spongebob,1
The Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I'm having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.,not spongebob,0
Quick. Block the door.,spongebob,1
There's just no sport in it.,not spongebob,0
Get everything?,spongebob,1
What about this? (Patrick holds Gary),not spongebob,0
Not Gary. Think it'll hold?,spongebob,1
"I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)",not spongebob,0
(scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again),not spongebob,0
Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)",spongebob,1
I'm the Deadly Fisherman!,not spongebob,0
(scream),not spongebob,0
"I guess this is the end, old buddy.",spongebob,1
I don't want to die in my underwear!,not spongebob,0
Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.,spongebob,1
Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. (Patrick takes off his underwear) Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!,not spongebob,0
(scream),not spongebob,0
That thing's eating Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, play 33. I need you to go long. And... break. You're going down, Fisherman!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window.  Okay! I think you got it!   Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oops.  Doink.  I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh?  Huh, I don't remember making such a mess.  And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti.  Nope.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hey, Patrick.  Wake up, Patrick!  Whoa!",spongebob,1
Whoa!,spongebob,1
"Patrick, no!",spongebob,1
No!,spongebob,1
Whew.,spongebob,1
Shh! Shhh!,spongebob,1
Uh-huh. Phew.,spongebob,1
What the?!,not spongebob,0
Ooh!  Ow!,spongebob,1
Bleach!  Ow!,spongebob,1
Mm. Ahh...,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, no!  Don't!",spongebob,1
Huh?,spongebob,1
Ohh!,spongebob,1
Whoa!,spongebob,1
Breezy.,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother.",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he'll be fine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob...",not spongebob,0
Check out our new balloon.,spongebob,1
Her name is Squeaky.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
New invention?!,not spongebob,0
See?,not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts.  Yoink!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!",not spongebob,0
"Pretty nifty, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do?  Vroom, vroom, vroom!",spongebob,1
"Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you heard Sandy.  We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this!",spongebob,1
"Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob.  Or..or this!",not spongebob,0
And under no circumstances should you ever touch this.  Boink.,spongebob,1
Whoa.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, so swirly.",spongebob,1
Look at all the colors.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you do, don't walk into it!",not spongebob,0
Can we skip into it?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now!  Now turn around.  Now walk.",not spongebob,0
Oh.  Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.,not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh!",spongebob,1
"Goodness.  Mm, mmm.",not spongebob,0
"Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one.",spongebob,1
Must be the boring dimension. Let's go home.,not spongebob,0
"Maybe there's an exit this way.  Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn.  Huh?  Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!",spongebob,1
I can't take it! Let me out of here!,not spongebob,0
Hmm. Huh?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Mm... Oh, Patrick, watch this!  Boink.",spongebob,1
"Whoops, sorry!",spongebob,1
"Heh, draw some more!",not spongebob,0
Nice décor.  Hmm.,spongebob,1
"Oh, my house!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!",not spongebob,0
"Oops, forgot to draw the ground.",spongebob,1
Ahh.,not spongebob,0
I'm starving.,not spongebob,0
"No problem.  Two patties coming right up!  Your doodle patty, sir.",spongebob,1
Tastes weird.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they are a little dry.",spongebob,1
I miss real Krabby Patties!,not spongebob,0
I miss Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
I miss Sandy.,not spongebob,0
I miss Gary.,spongebob,1
I miss Squidward!,not spongebob,0
You know who I miss most of all?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"But Patrick, I'm right here.",spongebob,1
"Aww, isn't he cute?",spongebob,1
How do you do?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh! He disappeared!  Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!",not spongebob,0
"He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.",spongebob,1
You doodle!,not spongebob,0
"Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hold on, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Oh, thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome.  I guess we need to be more careful.,spongebob,1
Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.,spongebob,1
"Oh, run!",not spongebob,0
"What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
We'll have to fight doodle with doodle.  Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad!  Attack!,spongebob,1
"Patrick, run!",spongebob,1
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm going in.  Cover me.",spongebob,1
"I gotcha, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Whoa!  What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?",spongebob,1
Over here.,not spongebob,0
"Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!",spongebob,1
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you!",spongebob,1
Good to know!,not spongebob,0
"Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of... SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table!  Charge!",spongebob,1
Ha-ha!,spongebob,1
Release my friend before I get really tough!,spongebob,1
I gotcha! I gotcha!,spongebob,1
Oof!,not spongebob,0
What are we gonna do?,not spongebob,0
In here.,spongebob,1
Phew.,spongebob,1
"Nah-nah, you missed us!  Now you gotta kiss us!",not spongebob,0
Nah-nah...,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, we'll never get back home!",spongebob,1
We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squeaky!  Squeaky!  Grab on, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Too slow, DoodleBob!",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Here, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Oh, ooh, uh... snip!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.",spongebob,1
But we're still stuck here.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home.  Wait a minute, Patrick!  Doodle us home, Sandy.",spongebob,1
Bleeble blobble blortex!,not spongebob,0
"Yay! Thanks, Sandy!",not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
"Hmm, mm-hmm...  What the—?",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, we're back!",spongebob,1
I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?,not spongebob,0
Sandy saved us.,spongebob,1
What?  Huh? Huh?,not spongebob,0
Give me back my nuts!,not spongebob,0
It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.,not spongebob,0
"I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?",spongebob,1
"Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Hey, learning tastes good.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I needed those.",spongebob,1
"Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.",not spongebob,0
57 times.,spongebob,1
"Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.",not spongebob,0
I'm a winner?,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner.,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner.,spongebob,1
Who's a winner?!,not spongebob,0
I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!,spongebob,1
One minute thirty seven seconds later...,not spongebob,0
"How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.",not spongebob,0
"I didn't get a license, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Are they gonna mail it to you?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.",spongebob,1
"No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.",not spongebob,0
"Let's just go home, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.",spongebob,1
"Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. No!",spongebob,1
Good morning.,not spongebob,0
You're not the judge of me!,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I am. Let the testing begin!",not spongebob,0
I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm here for you, buddy.",spongebob,1
I passed my test!,not spongebob,0
You got a perfect score?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.",not spongebob,0
Perfect score.,spongebob,1
"Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license.",not spongebob,0
"Stand behind the line, sir.",not spongebob,0
How do I look?,not spongebob,0
Like a winner.,spongebob,1
Ready?,not spongebob,0
Ready.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.",not spongebob,0
Does that mean I get a free key chain?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, no.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.,not spongebob,0
Yeah! All right!,not spongebob,0
Women will want you.  Men will want to be you.  You'll be the envy of your friends.,not spongebob,0
Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.,not spongebob,0
I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!,spongebob,1
"The horn works.  Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.",spongebob,1
Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.,not spongebob,0
Two millionth?,spongebob,1
Then you can get a free boat just like me.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, just like you.",spongebob,1
I try to serve as an inspiration to others.,not spongebob,0
Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.,spongebob,1
"I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for the ride, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
"I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep.",not spongebob,0
"4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?",spongebob,1
You will never guess what happen to me today.,not spongebob,0
You got your license.,spongebob,1
Yeah!  But that's not all.,not spongebob,0
You got a new boat.,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life.",not spongebob,0
Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.",spongebob,1
"Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.",not spongebob,0
Thanks for the ride.,spongebob,1
"No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license.",not spongebob,0
That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.",not spongebob,0
When did we get a drive-thru?,spongebob,1
I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.,not spongebob,0
I used to have a dream.,spongebob,1
Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I—",spongebob,1
"The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"What's with the helmet, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image.",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"Boy, driving is so easy.",not spongebob,0
Oh?,spongebob,1
Do you want me to give you lessons?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that would be great.",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?",not spongebob,0
"What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.",not spongebob,0
"That's great, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.",not spongebob,0
Mom!,spongebob,1
"Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.",not spongebob,0
Hey.,spongebob,1
Even Patrick has a license.,not spongebob,0
Let's see what this baby can do.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah.",not spongebob,0
40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.,spongebob,1
What? Where? Who?,not spongebob,0
"Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?",spongebob,1
"Umm... okay.  Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale.",not spongebob,0
"Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!",spongebob,1
So?,not spongebob,0
You're suppose to stop!,spongebob,1
I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.,not spongebob,0
Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!,spongebob,1
They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?,not spongebob,0
"I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!",spongebob,1
"How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!",not spongebob,0
"If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!",spongebob,1
I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!",spongebob,1
"Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force.",not spongebob,0
It's the police!,not spongebob,0
"Pull it over, litterbug!",not spongebob,0
Litterbug?! No!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I got me a runner.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what do you think you're doing?",spongebob,1
I don't know! I don't have a license anymore.,not spongebob,0
90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.,not spongebob,0
"So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.",not spongebob,0
What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.,spongebob,1
"Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days!",not spongebob,0
One debt to society later...,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, then what do we do with this?",spongebob,1
How's that?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
"Ready, buddy?",not spongebob,0
"Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin'?",spongebob,1
"Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.",not spongebob,0
Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.,not spongebob,0
"And why is that, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Because then you'd only get to repair it once.,not spongebob,0
"So, what flavor is it?",spongebob,1
"It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.",not spongebob,0
"No, I mean the toothpaste!",spongebob,1
Oh. Well I think it's...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium-sized hole in the wall!",spongebob,1
Time to get out the dental floss. Ha!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks again for taking us to the Krusty Krab, dad.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Mom never brings us here!,not spongebob,0
Ha. Any time kids.  What the?,not spongebob,0
Careful now...,spongebob,1
"Hey, you guys put in a drive thru!",not spongebob,0
We did?,not spongebob,0
"Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and two extra large orders of Krabby Rings.  Is this toothpaste?",not spongebob,0
"Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive thru!",not spongebob,0
A drive--- whoa!,spongebob,1
Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.,not spongebob,0
You mean for you.,not spongebob,0
It'll cost you money.,not spongebob,0
"Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?",not spongebob,0
"I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go. It even lights up, see?",spongebob,1
"Well, that's great SpongeBob, but I already got a bunch of stuff that's better: A menu board made with old napkins and packing tape, a microphone I made with some rusty tin cans I found, and this sign... I made from an old noodle.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than the things I bought?",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, what?",not spongebob,0
How is this stuff better?,spongebob,1
Because it was...  Free!,not spongebob,0
"I'll have a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty,  and a medium drink.",not spongebob,0
"Comin' right up, sir.  SpongeBob, I need a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, and a medium drink.",not spongebob,0
"I'll have that ready in two shakes in a lamprey's tail!  That oughta' fix it!  Thank you, come again.",spongebob,1
"Yes, you like it here, don't you?  Can I help you?  A bill?! What's this for?",not spongebob,0
"It's for my dry cleaning. It seems as though your new drive-through window is a little on the challenge side.  Size-wise, I mean.",not spongebob,0
"There, problem solved!",not spongebob,0
Meanwhile...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.",not spongebob,0
Excuse me? I'd like to place an order please.,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wonderful. Peachy... Now how am I supposed to get to SpongeBob so I can hand him these order tickets here?",not spongebob,0
Problem solved!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Hi!,spongebob,1
Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone to college.,not spongebob,0
"Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible:  By ordering one!  Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra secret formula!  Hello?! Is this stupid thing on?!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward! Any customers?,not spongebob,0
None that I can hear.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Here comes one now!,not spongebob,0
Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around!,not spongebob,0
Large Krabby Patty with fries please.,not spongebob,0
With fries. Got it. We'll have that right out to you sir.,not spongebob,0
What? You're closed?! Now she tells me...,not spongebob,0
"There you are sir. The ketchup's in the b--  What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty?  Nobody, huh? Okay, I'll just toss it in the trash.",not spongebob,0
Later...,not spongebob,0
I sure am in a jovial mood! How about you guys?,not spongebob,0
"You bet, Pearl!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm feeling especially jovial. You know, being a teenager and all!",not spongebob,0
Welcome to the Krusty Krab drive thru. Can I take your order?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you guys. It sounds like that weird guy Squidward. What do you say we play a prank on him?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Sounds like a great idea to me! Being a teenager and all!  Two large Krabby Patties, please!  With fries!",not spongebob,0
Owwwww! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurt. A lot.,not spongebob,0
A bill?! And what is this for?,not spongebob,0
It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!,not spongebob,0
You have any idea how much a real microphone and speaker cost?!,not spongebob,0
How much?,not spongebob,0
Well... they cost as much as... as uh... as a... real microphone and... speaker.,not spongebob,0
Just then.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa. Woopsie!",not spongebob,0
Hey! You delinquent!,not spongebob,0
Now you'll have to replace it.,not spongebob,0
Replace what?,not spongebob,0
The microphone!,not spongebob,0
"What do I look like, I'm made out of tin cans?",not spongebob,0
"No, but that pile of tin cans over there is.",not spongebob,0
Good thing we got you around to always point out the obvious.,not spongebob,0
Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry about that, dude.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's nice!  I'm still billing you for the damages!",not spongebob,0
One Krabby Meal! To go!,spongebob,1
Hand it on up here!,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Larry!",spongebob,1
"Come on, bro! You can do it!  Or maybe not.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'm concerned.",spongebob,1
"Oh? Why, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's S.U.B.!,spongebob,1
Yeah... Well there's a solution to every problem!  There! Problem solved!  Hey! What's all the ruckourous about!? Whoa...,not spongebob,0
Hey! What's the hold up?!,not spongebob,0
How long you gonna make us wait?!,not spongebob,0
We're waiting here for hours!,not spongebob,0
We're still waiting... in our driveway!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!,not spongebob,0
That's nice.  That's interesting.,not spongebob,0
I guess I'll be retiring early after all!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Eugene Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Yes?  What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!,not spongebob,0
"A ticket?  Now why would I write you a ticket? Huh? Oh, I know! How about for turning the whole town into a parking lot?!",not spongebob,0
Ah! But officer! I a... I a... Listen!,not spongebob,0
"Relax man, that's just my order. I want two Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go!  I don't wait in lines!",not spongebob,0
"Oh sure! Right! Phew!  SpongeBob, can you get the kind officer two-",not spongebob,0
"-Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!",spongebob,1
"There you go, officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge.",not spongebob,0
You're welcome. Just hope the mayor doesn't find out about this mess. He's the one you need to worry about!  Mayor.,not spongebob,0
Eugene Krabs!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Mayor!,not spongebob,0
The whole town is in a stand-still because your drive thru is so slow!,not spongebob,0
"Well... don't you worry, Mr. Mayor! There's an answer for that, too!  There you go! See, now we got two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast!",not spongebob,0
Hmm! That should work perfectly!,not spongebob,0
Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra chee-?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Order up!,not spongebob,0
I'm on it!,spongebob,1
"Hurry, SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!",not spongebob,0
26 orders up!,spongebob,1
"No, no, no! Not that window! The other one!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, are you sure?! These customers over here look really, really hungry!",spongebob,1
And these ones don't?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey, watch it, will ya?! I just had this thing repainted!",not spongebob,0
And I just had this repainted!,not spongebob,0
I see you used the extra-glossy...,not spongebob,0
Chum nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're runny! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off...  for me!  Oh no... not again.,not spongebob,0
Oh darn it! Now there's a line!,not spongebob,0
"Watch where you're going, old man! This is the second time!",not spongebob,0
I'm too old to wait in lines!,not spongebob,0
Chum Nuggets... get 'em before  my arm falls off...,not spongebob,0
They're everywhere!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Stay back! Take Squidward, not me!  Oh, hi Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! We gotta do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!,spongebob,1
"For once, he's right!",not spongebob,0
"Easy, boys! Easy! Don't you think you're both getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right?  Like-  Oh... kay... Don't worry!  I can solve this!  More drive thrus! More money!",not spongebob,0
Hey? Is somebody eating potato chips?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs!  We can fix it!  We might need to buy some more toothpaste though.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Tag, you're it!  Gary will never find me here!  Uh-oh.  Tag! Now I'm it!",spongebob,1
"Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?",not spongebob,0
Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?,spongebob,1
"Oh boy, would I!",not spongebob,0
"Okay,  Tag, you're it!",spongebob,1
"I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!  Tag, you're it! I win, I win!  What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat!",not spongebob,0
That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!,spongebob,1
It tickles!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary.  Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.  What about you, Gary?  Gary? Gary?",spongebob,1
"Brush brush brush, brush brush brush…",not spongebob,0
"Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?",spongebob,1
"Brush brush brush,  Brushin' everywhere…  Nope.  Oh, hey, here he is!",not spongebob,0
"Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's a great idea!",spongebob,1
"A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games…",not spongebob,0
"Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.",spongebob,1
"And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…",not spongebob,0
"OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
Blah blah blah blah blah…,not spongebob,0
I'm awake!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?",spongebob,1
"Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows!  See?",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee!  Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me?  You're not chasing me…",spongebob,1
"Come on, Gary, let's play a different game.",not spongebob,0
"Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of…  …you… What's wrong with me?  Do I offend?  Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball!  Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip!  Huh? Huh-huh?  Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head!  All right, that's it!  Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!",not spongebob,0
What's that supposed to mean?,spongebob,1
"I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.",not spongebob,0
"Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way, Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary!",spongebob,1
"Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me…  ...for all that I've done?!  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da.  Bon appetite, Lary.  Okay, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I…  I guess you can sleep there…  I'll sleep down here.  Well, good night, Lary.  Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?!  Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?!  Gary?",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Gary.",spongebob,1
Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?,not spongebob,0
Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…,spongebob,1
"And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?",not spongebob,0
Soap? But… we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'…,spongebob,1
Here it comes…,not spongebob,0
"Du… du… duuuuu…  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you!  I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?",spongebob,1
How pathetic…,not spongebob,0
Gary…?,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww…  Let's go for a walk, pal!",spongebob,1
Gary? I thought what we had was special...!,not spongebob,0
"Order up, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?",not spongebob,0
To go home?,not spongebob,0
"No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy!",not spongebob,0
"That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah.",spongebob,1
I Heart you...,not spongebob,0
"Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it.",not spongebob,0
"I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?",spongebob,1
It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of?,not spongebob,0
Eyelashes!,spongebob,1
Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?,not spongebob,0
After you present your brotherhood gift.,not spongebob,0
I'll buy the little twerp a Gumball.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.",not spongebob,0
The only thing I'm making is for the exit.,not spongebob,0
"Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears.",spongebob,1
"I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.",not spongebob,0
Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?,not spongebob,0
"Heave-ho!  If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one.",not spongebob,0
"Wait!  We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.",not spongebob,0
"So, what flavor is it?",not spongebob,0
Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.",not spongebob,0
"Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  To SpongeBob... Well, here you go.",spongebob,1
And that's what happened!,not spongebob,0
25 dollars?! A bomb?!,not spongebob,0
In the Krusty Krab?!,not spongebob,0
That's where you left it.,not spongebob,0
It's not there.,not spongebob,0
"Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala.",spongebob,1
You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?,not spongebob,0
Kill him?,not spongebob,0
"Here's your order, sir.",spongebob,1
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
"No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!",not spongebob,0
"Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!",not spongebob,0
You've seen this before?,not spongebob,0
Eleven times as a matter of fact.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?",not spongebob,0
"Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it!",not spongebob,0
Note to self: Watch out for Squidward.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.",not spongebob,0
"Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two...",spongebob,1
"Please, don't do that.",not spongebob,0
What's the part two?,spongebob,1
"Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.",spongebob,1
"Great. Uh, let me see it.",not spongebob,0
"The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.",spongebob,1
Everything's in red.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I know.",spongebob,1
We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.,not spongebob,0
"Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.",spongebob,1
"Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.",not spongebob,0
"Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over.",not spongebob,0
"Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.",spongebob,1
Which is...?,not spongebob,0
I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.,spongebob,1
You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?,not spongebob,0
"That's a good one Squidward!  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.",spongebob,1
Who's there?,not spongebob,0
I am!,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah...",not spongebob,0
"Look out, everyone, friends in reverse!",spongebob,1
"Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.",spongebob,1
I can't breathe.,not spongebob,0
Are you sure you should be poking it like that?,not spongebob,0
Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is...,spongebob,1
Does it involve more dismemberment?,not spongebob,0
Watch the sunset with Squidward.,spongebob,1
Sunset?,not spongebob,0
"The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later.",spongebob,1
"C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us.",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Explosions... I mean, erosion.",not spongebob,0
"You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.",spongebob,1
Four... three... two... one...,not spongebob,0
I guess we started too early. Let's start again.,spongebob,1
"Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.",spongebob,1
Why are you still here?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.",spongebob,1
"Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!",not spongebob,0
You want me to explode?,spongebob,1
Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!,not spongebob,0
"Um, okay, I'll try.  Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it!  Now it's your turn!",spongebob,1
That's not what I meant you barnacle head!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, good one.",spongebob,1
No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!,not spongebob,0
Why would I do that?,spongebob,1
Because the pie you ate was a bomb!,not spongebob,0
What pie?,spongebob,1
"The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!",not spongebob,0
"Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops!",spongebob,1
Ouch.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Do you know what today is?,spongebob,1
Annoy Squidward Day?,not spongebob,0
"No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?",not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs gives you that award, so you'll work harder for no extra money.",not spongebob,0
"That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder.",spongebob,1
"Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.",spongebob,1
"Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.",not spongebob,0
Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!,spongebob,1
Need some help?  What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Making...Krabby Patties?,spongebob,1
You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of--  ...garbage.,not spongebob,0
Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!,spongebob,1
"I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!",not spongebob,0
"That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...",spongebob,1
It's a symbol that you're a chump!,not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward!",spongebob,1
And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.,spongebob,1
"I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!",not spongebob,0
What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!,spongebob,1
"Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!",not spongebob,0
"But, sir…",spongebob,1
"There's no room for buts in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?",not spongebob,0
"Crystal, sir!",spongebob,1
Good! Now move out!,not spongebob,0
I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What are you doing here?!,not spongebob,0
You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!,spongebob,1
"Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!",not spongebob,0
That can be arranged.,spongebob,1
"You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.",spongebob,1
Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!,not spongebob,0
I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!",spongebob,1
Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!",spongebob,1
I don't need to sleep! Loser!,not spongebob,0
"Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.",spongebob,1
"I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?",spongebob,1
"No, how about you?",not spongebob,0
Nope!  Nighty Night.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?",spongebob,1
I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!,not spongebob,0
"All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!,spongebob,1
That oughta hold him!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Why, you little…!",not spongebob,0
"Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!",spongebob,1
"So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?",not spongebob,0
Truce.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!",not spongebob,0
You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.,spongebob,1
"Okay, let's have a good clean fight.",not spongebob,0
"And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!",spongebob,1
"Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.",not spongebob,0
As soon as he stops shaking my hand...,spongebob,1
...I'm gonna make a run for it.,not spongebob,0
"Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!",spongebob,1
"Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
What's going on here?!,not spongebob,0
"It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0

Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it.",not spongebob,0

Trying to have a relaxing evening.,not spongebob,0

All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax  in peace!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, Squidward is really really sad...",spongebob,1
You're right. Let's go poke someone else.,not spongebob,0
"How about instead, we do something extra special for him! Then he won't be sad anymore!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I get it. It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all of Gary's... I mean feed Gary for a week.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it",spongebob,1
Vow?,not spongebob,0

Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break.  Ahh.,spongebob,1
That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out.,not spongebob,0
I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo!,spongebob,1
"Oh, hey, how about this?",not spongebob,0
That's awesome!,spongebob,1
Ooh. I know that sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?,not spongebob,0

Funny faces make me laugh!,not spongebob,0
What?! Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?,not spongebob,0
"Why, is there something wrong?",spongebob,1
"Haven't ye ever heard the saying If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Let me tell you the story of face freeze.  It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was sticking his tongue at people.",not spongebob,0
How rude!,not spongebob,0
"Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out...",not spongebob,0
"Huh, huh... Huh?",not spongebob,0
...permanently!,not spongebob,0
Weirdo.,not spongebob,0
No... no!,not spongebob,0
"He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?",not spongebob,0
Mm-mm.,not spongebob,0
Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.,not spongebob,0
I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.,spongebob,1
Done and done.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.,spongebob,1
"Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. This is...  easy. How you holding up?,spongebob,1
"Huh, fine. You?",not spongebob,0
Dun ah eeh.,not spongebob,0
Hey!  Patrick.  Patrick!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.,spongebob,1
"Gosh, you're right.",not spongebob,0
"Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.",spongebob,1
You mean like this?  Ree eeh eeh!,not spongebob,0
Aye yi yi yi!,not spongebob,0

Awoot duh doo!,spongebob,1
Looo ooo ooo!,not spongebob,0
Day ah dah da dah!,spongebob,1
"I can't breathe!  Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.",spongebob,1
"Yes! But, how to choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross,  uh? And then slip into an overbite.  And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.",not spongebob,0
"Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one...  The Gary. Meow!",spongebob,1
"Gloriously disgusting, sir.",not spongebob,0
Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea.,spongebob,1
You two need help.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
It never gets so old!,spongebob,1
Do you mind?!,not spongebob,0
Mind what? Making faces? Of course were don't.,spongebob,1
"You got that right, pal! What a silly question.",not spongebob,0
"Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face.",spongebob,1
I don't wanna make faces. I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!,not spongebob,0
That's a good one right there.,spongebob,1
"Oh, good one, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!",spongebob,1
Oh yeah? Watch me.,not spongebob,0
Whatever works.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!",spongebob,1
"Actually, I can't move my face at all.",not spongebob,0
I can't move my face either!,spongebob,1
All right! We did it!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right!  Patrick, we have the face freeze!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!",spongebob,1
Sandy! Sandy!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.",not spongebob,0
"And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"Well, I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension.  You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. I can feel them knots just meltin' away. Let's see if I can just finesse that jaw line back in place.  Phew! Okay, you two. Bad news first. That wicked face freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hey, you all right, boy? Eh, look a little cattywampus walking in here.",not spongebob,0
"Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'...",spongebob,1
"Ahem. Uh, but what's with the skewed posture?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.",spongebob,1
Penny? Where?! Where?!,not spongebob,0
That'll buy me some time.,spongebob,1
"Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are piling up.",not spongebob,0
"I'm on it, Squidward!  Onion juice! Ah!",spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay.  Ow! Phew. Order up.",spongebob,1
"You deliver it, I'm on break.",not spongebob,0
"Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny.  Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance.,spongebob,1
"Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...",not spongebob,0
"Your order is served, sir.",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear.",spongebob,1
I'm taking my clams elsewhere.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, come back!",not spongebob,0
"Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?",spongebob,1
What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?,not spongebob,0
"Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts.",spongebob,1
"Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o.  So I can see your face.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs?  My impersonation of a burrito!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh. Is this a bad time, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I see what's going on here.  Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories.",spongebob,1
"I'm losing business because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah!  No! I can't move me face. I've got the face freeze, too!",not spongebob,0
What is the hold up in here—?,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! you could get the face freeze!",spongebob,1
"Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too!  This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh.  Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done.",not spongebob,0

First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams.  Coochie coochie coo.,not spongebob,0

"Ooh, aww.",not spongebob,0
I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along.,not spongebob,0

"Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that was egg-citing.",spongebob,1
The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.,not spongebob,0

Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy?  That tickles.,spongebob,1
"Uh, could somebody hand me those?",spongebob,1

Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.,spongebob,1

"Bye, Old Man Jenkins!",not spongebob,0
"Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens.",spongebob,1
"Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, you think we just imagined it?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, probably— A UFO!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.",spongebob,1
Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?,not spongebob,0
New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,spongebob,1
What?! That is totally unfair!,not spongebob,0
Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or--,spongebob,1

"Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula!  Why aren't you laughing?",not spongebob,0
I've heard this joke before.,not spongebob,0
"All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw! Day 3!",not spongebob,0

"Um, you're making me nervous.",spongebob,1

Hypnosis?!,spongebob,1
"Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked.

It worked! I'm cured!,spongebob,1
But what about the formula?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!",spongebob,1
"No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick!",not spongebob,0
"Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.",spongebob,1

"No, seriously. Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!  Hey, kiddies! It's your old pal, Patchy, floating somewhere over Bikini Bottom. I sailed down here to witness something that only happens every 100 years. Why, me and my trusted parrot, Potty, wouldn't miss it for the world, would we, Potty? Potty?",not spongebob,0
Rah!  I'm just here for the buffet.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty!  Give me that!  Potty, I told you to leave those fish alone! What do you think you are, a seahawk?",not spongebob,0
I can't help if I was born a predator. Rah!,not spongebob,0

Since when is the moon so green?,spongebob,1
"Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, SpongeBob.  It's just been up there so long, it's getting moldy.  Oh, but I'd still eat it.",not spongebob,0
"That ain't the moon, guys. The real moon comes out at night, remember? Something's fishy going on here.",not spongebob,0

"Yeah, walk outside and check out this awesome moon.",not spongebob,0
"Hello? Hello, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"No! Not me!  Huh? I guess it only effects sea creatures, but I still don't get why that green moon is turning everyone into wild swimming fish?  Am I the only one left?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, whoever used that restroom last was an animal!  Hey, put me down! Sandy! What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!  What is the meaning of—",not spongebob,0
Get in the shade!,not spongebob,0

"Ah, Sandy Cheeks.  How is it hanging?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's not hanging too good, Frenchy. You see, there's this—",not spongebob,0
"Don't say another word. I have been monitoring the behavior of the green moon all day. It is called Neptune's Moon. Every 100 years, it de-evolves everyone in Bikini Bottom into primal fish for two hours.",not spongebob,0
Two hours?,not spongebob,0
Until it falls into another volcano and is extinguished.,not spongebob,0
"I knewed it was nature, dagnabit! That's a relief. So I just have to keep Squidward in the shade for a couple of hours.  Whew! Thanks, Frenchy.",not spongebob,0
I'm going home to hide under the covers! It's every cephalopod for himself!,not spongebob,0
"Frenchy, I gotta call you back!  Squidward, you have to stay in the shade!",not spongebob,0
Help!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! No!,not spongebob,0
"O.M. Jehoshaphat! You don't see that everyday.  My friends are gonna be lunch if I don't think fast!  SpongeBob! Patrick!  Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs!  Larry!  Yeeouch!  Look out, Pearl! I'll save you!

"Here's where we get off!  Thanks for the lift, Pearl! Don't you worry. Nobody's going to eat you guys on my watch.  Ow!  Dinner time! Come and get it!  This is so fascinating, Frenchy. Tell me more about my fishy friends. Oh, wait. I'll put you on speaker phone.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the lobster. The cockroach of the sea. Skittering across the ocean floor, the lobster sheds its skin once a week... And then eats it.",not spongebob,0
"Now that's what I call recycling, huh, Frenchy?",not spongebob,0
"Ah, notice the scavenger crab eating garbage  unaware he is being stalked by his natural predator, the puffer fish.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, you don't.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"I knew I was gonna have to separate you two.  You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.  Ow!  Yeowch!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, observe how the hungry sea star ejects his own stomach from his body in order to eat his meal,  where the primitive sea sponge filters nutrients and oxygen from bacteria particles.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob is never gonna believe this.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the giant octopus. One of the largest predators on the ocean floor.",not spongebob,0
"Texas toast! It's a good thing my treedome is made of ten tons of pressure proof glass, huh, Frenchy?",not spongebob,0
"Oui, Sandy, that is true, but, unfortunately, the poisonous and highly intelligent octopus can also cut through hard bedrock with its beak.",not spongebob,0
"You don't see that everyday! Squidward, no!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa!  Oh!  Hi-yah!  Aah, hominy grits!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the battle for the survival of the fittest rages on in the animal kingdom.",not spongebob,0
My friends! My tree!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, you must remember, who is the natural enemy of the octopus?",not spongebob,0
That's a great idea.,not spongebob,0
"Using her versatile tail, the Texas Land squirrel calls out to the natural enemy of the octopus.",not spongebob,0
"There she blows, y'all!",not spongebob,0
The whale.,not spongebob,0
"Sick 'em, Pearl! Sorry, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Ohh!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Two hours is up? Thank goodness.,not spongebob,0
And so we bid a fond adieu to Neptune's Moon as it descends back into the Earth from whence it came. We will see it again in 100 years.  Goal!,not spongebob,0
Oops.,not spongebob,0
What is going on here?  My clothes!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Aah!,not spongebob,0
"Um, Sandy, how come your treedome is broken and everyone's naked?",spongebob,1
"Well, SpongeBob, let's just say this has been the most interesting birthday I ever had.",not spongebob,0
"And, of course, Neptune's Moon is always followed by Neptune's Sun.",not spongebob,0
You don't see that everyday. Jinx! Buy me a patty!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, Bikini Bottom. Teaming with life and naked mysteries. This next whale song is going out to my favorite squirrel. Sandy, happy birthday.",not spongebob,0
Yee haw! Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, Potty, I never thought it'd end up like this, brunch for a shark.",not spongebob,0
"I guess this is it. Good-bye, Patchy.",not spongebob,0
"Good-bye, Potty.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
"Frenchy, you surprising scallywag! Get—What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
"Ah, Patchy the pirate, I just swam back to warn you about Neptune's Sun, but it's too late. Au revoir.",not spongebob,0
Bye. Neptune's Sun?  What's happening?!,not spongebob,0
"Mm, yummy.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished. I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?",not spongebob,0
"Hark, the odor you seek is before you.",not spongebob,0
"At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  And served with a smile by our friendly waiter.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.",spongebob,1
Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, cause you're the mascot.",spongebob,1
"Nah, I don't think so!  We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays!",spongebob,1
"Oh, for dolphins sakes! Do tell what's troubling you so!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.,spongebob,1
Shocking.,not spongebob,0
I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimic.,spongebob,1
Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.,not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"That'll keep him out of my hair.  Of course, he actually has one.  To each, his own.",not spongebob,0
Mustard!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your freakishness.",not spongebob,0
"Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal.",not spongebob,0
Good riddance.  What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!",not spongebob,0
"Ok, let's not overdo it.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist!  He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!",not spongebob,0
"Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.",not spongebob,0
"It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!",not spongebob,0
"Ohh, what is this?",spongebob,1
This is an authentic Fiasco!,not spongebob,0
A Fiasco?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"An original Fiasco, you say?",not spongebob,0
He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!,not spongebob,0
Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.,not spongebob,0
What's your asking price?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.",not spongebob,0
Hold it!   I'll take a million for it.,not spongebob,0
It's not yours to sell! I found it!,not spongebob,0
"Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco.",not spongebob,0
You tried to throw it away!  It's mine!,not spongebob,0
"Let's not be hasty. It belongs to…neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out.   It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure!  And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed!  And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest!",not spongebob,0
"Ready for duty, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.",not spongebob,0
"Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece!  Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!",not spongebob,0
"Two Krabby Patties, please.",not spongebob,0
Each!,not spongebob,0
"So, what have you got for me today, huh?  No Krabby Patty in sight.  What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty!  Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.",not spongebob,0
I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying!  Stop that thief!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
"Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free!",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!  What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage!  What's going on?,not spongebob,0
How long do you think we'll be here?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.,not spongebob,0
Mine does too.,not spongebob,0
"Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!",not spongebob,0
Don't move!,not spongebob,0
"Achoo!  Blasted pollen allergies!  Ahh, I should be safe in space.",not spongebob,0
Stop thief!,not spongebob,0
You gotta be kidding me!  Hello? Hello?  Open up!  Open up!,not spongebob,0
Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, what?  Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'!  Ok you two, against the wall!  That's it. Nice and slow.  You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!",not spongebob,0
"I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.,spongebob,1
Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.",spongebob,1
You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?,not spongebob,0
"No, you need to turn yourself in.",spongebob,1
"Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!",not spongebob,0
Who's that?,spongebob,1
"Me, you imbecile!",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
"Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Now you've gone too far!,spongebob,1
"No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!",not spongebob,0
I can't believe you're calling me that!,spongebob,1
"Believe it, Man Boy!",not spongebob,0
Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you eating?",spongebob,1
The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  Not bad.,not spongebob,0
Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!,spongebob,1
"Ohh, he's an accomplice too!",not spongebob,0
"Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.",not spongebob,0
"Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon.  You're all under arrest until we figure this out.",not spongebob,0
But what do you mean all?  I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution.",spongebob,1
Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.,not spongebob,0
"My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.",spongebob,1
X-rays tickle.,not spongebob,0
Such artistic genius!  I'll never paint again!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, don't I get a phone call?",not spongebob,0
"Wake up, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
We're moving today!,spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!",spongebob,1
"Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!!  ...To me!",spongebob,1
"What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today, I caught something terrible.",not spongebob,0
What'd ya catch?,not spongebob,0
I caught sight of the calendar.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.",not spongebob,0
I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?,not spongebob,0
You just missed him.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but he told us to tell you...",spongebob,1
Tell me what?,not spongebob,0
He told me to tell you... April Fools.,spongebob,1
"Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!",spongebob,1
"Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!",spongebob,1
You do?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well, as long as it's not me.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?",not spongebob,0
"They're riiiight here, lady!",spongebob,1
"But, this is a spoon...",not spongebob,0
APRIL FOOLS!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's that?",spongebob,1
"Well, I didn't see anything...  hey, where'd that other guy go?",not spongebob,0
April Fools!! I'm right here!!,spongebob,1
"Hey, that was pretty good.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing behind the counter?,not spongebob,0

I guess that is pretty funny!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  APRIL FOOOOOLS!",spongebob,1

...Ohhh!&#160;:(,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?",not spongebob,0
"Aww, man, poor kid.",not spongebob,0
That guy has definitely got some issues to work out.,not spongebob,0
April Fools... jerk.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, don't go!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you stink!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.  SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... What?  Patrick? What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
Digging.,not spongebob,0
Why are you wearing that hat?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
Where's SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
He's in the house. He's impressed.,not spongebob,0

"SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!",not spongebob,0
What do you want?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.",not spongebob,0

"I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?",not spongebob,0
I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.,spongebob,1
"Doh!  SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.",not spongebob,0
But I couldn't...,spongebob,1
I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!,not spongebob,0
It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.,not spongebob,0
"April Fools, jerk.",not spongebob,0
YOU STINK!,not spongebob,0
"Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Is all that true?,spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.",not spongebob,0

I promise.,spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
April Fools!,not spongebob,0

Hey!  What? You can't do that! It's not fair!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please! Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formuler.",not spongebob,0

"Hello, yes. I have a complaint.",not spongebob,0
That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest.,not spongebob,0
I am Agent Twirp of the Bogus  Business Bureau.  Are you the proprietor of this...  establishment?,not spongebob,0
"Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.",not spongebob,0
"Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs.  He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
New trainee.,not spongebob,0
"According to article 57 of the Greasy Spoon Code, all fast food contests must be open to all customers, no matter how diminutive or annoying.",not spongebob,0
"And I'm both of those things! You have to let me guess now,  Krabs!",not spongebob,0
I'm won't do it!  And you can't make me.,not spongebob,0
"If you refuse, I'll  shut down the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, fine!",not spongebob,0
This round goes to Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?",spongebob,1
No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.,not spongebob,0
Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's getting close.",not spongebob,0
...And one!,not spongebob,0
Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none! You are one over the mark. You lose.,not spongebob,0
Hold on! It's not official unless you count them.,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
A lot of boring math later...,not spongebob,0
"500298, 500299, 500300.  I win!",not spongebob,0
Eh!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs! Plankton was-- right.",spongebob,1
YES!,not spongebob,0
I now command you to give Mr. Plankton his prize.,not spongebob,0
"You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
I can't.,not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.,not spongebob,0
I cleaned it this morning.,spongebob,1
Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?,not spongebob,0
"Nope, she's perfectly aligned.",spongebob,1
"Drat your efficiency! Uh, oh, yeah!  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show!",not spongebob,0
What show?,not spongebob,0
The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty.  See?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?",not spongebob,0
"It clearly says, and a show. I'll allow it.",not spongebob,0
Drat!,not spongebob,0
Is this part of  the show?,not spongebob,0
"No, this is isn't part of the show.",not spongebob,0
"Mm, such lovely filigree, wouldn't you agree?",not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
Puppets!,spongebob,1
"Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.",not spongebob,0
La la la la la la la la!,not spongebob,0
"He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  Pla-- Flankton!",not spongebob,0
Boo! Hiss!,spongebob,1
"So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, My face! Ahhhhhhhh, My face!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, we get it already!",not spongebob,0
"Unfortunately for Flankton,  the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventurally he popped!  The end.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?",not spongebob,0
"Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.",not spongebob,0
"I'll do my best, sir.",spongebob,1
Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, to the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. It's a death trap.",not spongebob,0
"There we go.  Ooh, that takes care of that.  And in three, two, one.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it's awful! We're all out of buns!",spongebob,1
No buns? Drat the luck!,not spongebob,0
Got a delivery for the Krusty Krab. Where do you want us to put these buns?,not spongebob,0
"Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd.",spongebob,1
"Finally! At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine! Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.",not spongebob,0
One Krabby Patty to go.   Here you are.,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you don't!  You have to eat it on the premises.  Them's the rules.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that's what it says.",not spongebob,0
So?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay. I will!  I bid you good day, sir.",not spongebob,0
You gotta swallow it here on the premises.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on.",not spongebob,0
I'll allow it.,not spongebob,0
Fine!  Can I go now?,not spongebob,0
"Karen, quick! You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat!",not spongebob,0
But what about anesthetic?,not spongebob,0
There's no time! I can feel it digesting!,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you say, dear. Hold still.  This may pinch a little.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"What is it, lad?",not spongebob,0
Take a look.,spongebob,1
"Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene! You want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket!",not spongebob,0
I feel terrible! The Krabby Patty takes like stomach acid!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and it tastes like aspirin and carrots!  Ugh! Get it off! Get it off!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, come back! Oh, come on, Karen, what happened?",not spongebob,0
I just did what you asked.  I analyzed the contents of your stomach and used them to synthesize a  Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"It warms me heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over.  Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah,  and put these seeds back on 'em.",not spongebob,0
That's my Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.",not spongebob,0
Hmm... ah!,not spongebob,0
"My pencil!  What? No, no!",not spongebob,0
The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.,not spongebob,0
Noooooo!,not spongebob,0
"Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...",spongebob,1
Two...,not spongebob,0
Three!,not spongebob,0
"Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One...",spongebob,1
two...,not spongebob,0
"Three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper?",spongebob,1
"What is that thing, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
It looks like a giant pencil!,spongebob,1
Go touch it!,not spongebob,0
"It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it.",spongebob,1
Whatcha drawin'?,not spongebob,0
"Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck.",spongebob,1
"Psshh, artists.",not spongebob,0
It's a jellyfish.,spongebob,1
"Pretty good, SpongeBob, but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, everybody's a critic.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!",not spongebob,0
"Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic.",spongebob,1
"No, I mean it's swimming away!",not spongebob,0
"Do you know what this means, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Your art can never hang in a museum.,not spongebob,0
It means we found a magic pencil!,spongebob,1
Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.,not spongebob,0
Coming right up!,spongebob,1
"Life is good!  Easy come, easy go...",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. You've got looks, talent, all you need is a full head of...  HAIR!",not spongebob,0
My turn!,not spongebob,0
"Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.",spongebob,1
Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.,not spongebob,0
Okay! Why didn't you say so?,spongebob,1
Hey! Another jellyfish!,spongebob,1
"It's Squidward, silly!",not spongebob,0
It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.,spongebob,1
"You're right, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
We can't let it go into town!,spongebob,1
Poor Squidward.,not spongebob,0
Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!,spongebob,1
I think I fancy a stroll around the park.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me!  Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!",spongebob,1
He's going to the door.,not spongebob,0
He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...,spongebob,1
"OOH! OWW, OWW, OW!",not spongebob,0
He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!,not spongebob,0
"DoodleBoy, stop!",spongebob,1
He's got the pencil.,not spongebob,0
What have I done? We've got to find him!,spongebob,1
Where could he possibly be?,spongebob,1
Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, let's go!",spongebob,1
I'm not going in there,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there...",spongebob,1
What just happened?,not spongebob,0
"Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!",spongebob,1
Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?,not spongebob,0
No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.,spongebob,1
Neofineyin!,not spongebob,0
"See what I mean, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"WHERE'S THE LEAK, MA'AM?  Yurrgh!",not spongebob,0
"You okay, Patrick?",spongebob,1
FINLAND!,not spongebob,0
Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay!,not spongebob,0
There he is.,spongebob,1
"He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!",not spongebob,0
Uh... *ahem*.,spongebob,1
"Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob. Heh heh!",not spongebob,0
"He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?",not spongebob,0
Bawahh bwah bwah wahh!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!,spongebob,1
Happy Birthday!,not spongebob,0
Here's your present.  You're welcome.,not spongebob,0
Dewaaagheaugaaagh!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?",spongebob,1
EEDAHFAAWAHOBABOBBA!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, what was that?",spongebob,1
Ee...DAh...Faawa...HobaBobba...,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...!  I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!",spongebob,1
Take it easy. It's just a drawing.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Done and done.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.",spongebob,1
Meeeoowww.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, magic pencil.  Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!",spongebob,1
You Doodle! Me SpongeBob!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school.",spongebob,1
"Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!",not spongebob,0
Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?",not spongebob,0
"Take a look for yourself, Patrick.",spongebob,1
It's the evil Doodle!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose.",spongebob,1
So... he's a drawing?,not spongebob,0
Exactly! See how happy he is?,spongebob,1
He still looks kind of creepy.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Ready!,not spongebob,0
We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.,not spongebob,0
Huh? What's this?  My pencil!,not spongebob,0
The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.,not spongebob,0
NOOOOO!!!,not spongebob,0
What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?,not spongebob,0
"You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples!",not spongebob,0
"New and original, my exhaust fan.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!",not spongebob,0
You mean the smell?   Smell.,not spongebob,0
"No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what did he just say it was?",not spongebob,0
I just said they're free!,not spongebob,0
Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case...  So glad I actually left my house today.,not spongebob,0
"That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.",not spongebob,0
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!",not spongebob,0
Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and...  get him.",not spongebob,0
Free samples.  Yum!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you!, I know you're in there!",not spongebob,0
It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!,not spongebob,0
"If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!",not spongebob,0
Free Krabby Patties?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's all the hubble?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
That's it.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay.",not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties, anyone?",not spongebob,0
"I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.",spongebob,1
You!,not spongebob,0
You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
Over here boy.,not spongebob,0
What is going on out there?,spongebob,1
The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  Because the Krabby Patty is terrible.  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?",spongebob,1
Fine.  How about that?  I'm ruined!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.",spongebob,1
I'm all ears.,not spongebob,0
We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr-,spongebob,1
"Don't you say it, boy!",not spongebob,0
"It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time.",spongebob,1
Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free.,not spongebob,0
But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.,spongebob,1
I don't remember saying anything like that.,not spongebob,0
I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
"It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties!",spongebob,1
"Whew, uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed!",not spongebob,0
I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.",spongebob,1
"Hey look, Billy, a calliope.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.",spongebob,1
I can't feel my legs.,not spongebob,0
"Here let me help you, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Look, mama, a monkey!  Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!",not spongebob,0
I quit!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!",spongebob,1
"Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.",spongebob,1
"Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.",not spongebob,0
New... Different...  That's it!,spongebob,1
"Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room.",not spongebob,0
Five minutes later.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!",spongebob,1
You can't be serious.,not spongebob,0
"I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.",not spongebob,0
No! Wait!,not spongebob,0
"Let him go, it's too late.",not spongebob,0
All new free Krabby Patties!,spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose.  Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay!",not spongebob,0
Did he just say it was good?,not spongebob,0
Woohoo!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!",not spongebob,0
I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy?,not spongebob,0
"Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yum!  Hey, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more!",not spongebob,0
Now that's what I'm talking about!,not spongebob,0
Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Karen, I'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?!",not spongebob,0
It's working!,spongebob,1
"No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
"We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!",spongebob,1
"Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, money angels, can I make one?",spongebob,1
"Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?",not spongebob,0
Hear what?,spongebob,1
Good point.,not spongebob,0
"We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.. flipping burgers?!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, kids! Potty and I took jobs flipping burgers so we could be just like our hero...SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
I took the job for the free sodas.,not spongebob,0
"Potty, don't you have dishes to wash?",not spongebob,0
Argh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.",not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"One order of Scurvy Fries, one large Bilge Water.",not spongebob,0
Argh! Arrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Diet Bilge Water. I'll get right on it sir.  Ahhhhh!",not spongebob,0
P.U.! What died in there?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new Pirate Patties! I call this one Buried Treasure.",not spongebob,0
Where'd you dig that one up?,not spongebob,0
I call this one Walk the Plank.,not spongebob,0
I'm already board with that one.,not spongebob,0
This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The Patchy Patty!,not spongebob,0
Ahoy!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, that's the worst one yet.",not spongebob,0
"Potty Parrot, you are never supportive of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, Patchy, no!  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Squawk!",not spongebob,0
"You know, this isn't the first time that a patty's come between two good chums. It happened once in Bikini Bottom. Here, take a look while I......pull myself together.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, something ain't right.",not spongebob,0
For me?,not spongebob,0
Don't you find this a tad suspicious?,not spongebob,0
Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing.,not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
Duck!,spongebob,1
Disengage!,not spongebob,0
Me secret formula!,not spongebob,0
"Happy Birthday, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Don't forget your condiments, Plankton.",spongebob,1
"Attaboy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Safe!,spongebob,1
"You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles.",not spongebob,0
"Why, Mr. Krabs? Why does he hate us so?!",spongebob,1
"Well, you might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I...were...best friends.",not spongebob,0
Best friends?,spongebob,1
"Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones...",not spongebob,0
Goo.,not spongebob,0
Aw!,not spongebob,0
...things were all peaches and cream... ...until we hit grade school.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Planky. What'cha doing?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out.  Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away.",not spongebob,0
"How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000?",not spongebob,0
"They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!",not spongebob,0
"Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry.  Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping, the trash can?",not spongebob,0
"'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ....fashion me clothes from rags.",not spongebob,0
"There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.",not spongebob,0
Oops.  I missed a spot.,not spongebob,0
"Then one day, as Plankton and I plotted our revenge, I met the love of me life.",not spongebob,0
What in Neptune's name is that?  It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!,not spongebob,0
It's money.,not spongebob,0
Moneyyyyyyyyyy?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. You can buy things with it.,not spongebob,0
Buy things?,not spongebob,0
"So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea what that went through to get here.",spongebob,1
"I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?",spongebob,1
Yeah. I really wanna know.,not spongebob,0
"Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called Stinky Burgers. It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky.  And Stinky loved the kids.",not spongebob,0
"Now, what can I do for you, young 'uns?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one burger, please!",not spongebob,0
"Me, too, Stinky!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone.",not spongebob,0
"That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.",not spongebob,0
"We don't like Stinky, we respect him.",not spongebob,0
"Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like or respect me?",not spongebob,0
Like!,not spongebob,0
Respect!,not spongebob,0
Like!,not spongebob,0
Respect!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me.",not spongebob,0
Excuse us!,not spongebob,0
Valuable customers coming through.,not spongebob,0
What are those dorks doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Two Stinky Burgers, please.",not spongebob,0
"Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Stinky!",not spongebob,0
Thanks for keeping the nerds out.,not spongebob,0
"You're the best, Stinky.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy.  Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li...  Is it quitting time already?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials.",not spongebob,0
"Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipping burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.",not spongebob,0
"Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if someone made a better burger, they'd have a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?",not spongebob,0
"Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!",not spongebob,0
I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met.  If I could only hear his voice.,not spongebob,0
Less talking and more working.,not spongebob,0
Potty! You came back to apologize!,not spongebob,0
I came to tell you to get back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, a little thing called the G.E.D., my man.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, here we go again with the fancy book-learnin'. Customers love me cookin'. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?",not spongebob,0
"You just need some practice, that's all.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, me patty's done.",not spongebob,0
Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, fine. I'll eat it!  Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!  Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, roll film.  A perfect patty on the first try.",not spongebob,0
"Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!",not spongebob,0
"You're unsanitary, Patchy. You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's what gives it its special flavor.",not spongebob,0
You've got rats in the kitchen!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess?  Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!",not spongebob,0
And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.,not spongebob,0
What? Every time?,not spongebob,0
That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.,not spongebob,0
What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?,not spongebob,0
The same kind who wears a Kiss the Cook apron.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh?",not spongebob,0
Now I feel sick.,not spongebob,0
"That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?",not spongebob,0
Now you've done it.,not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Pirateson.  You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.",not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,not spongebob,0
"Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.",not spongebob,0
"So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress.",not spongebob,0
Gently. Gently.,not spongebob,0
"We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kids' greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please.",not spongebob,0
"There you are, sir.",not spongebob,0
"'Twas me first dollar I ever earned, and 'twas also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.",not spongebob,0
"Hey! Your burgers are even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.",not spongebob,0
"Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.",not spongebob,0
I thought it was our recipe.,not spongebob,0
I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds!,not spongebob,0
But what about satisfying the customer?,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!",not spongebob,0
Give me that!,not spongebob,0
Stop! You're gonna bust it!,not spongebob,0
Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!,not spongebob,0
"I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?",not spongebob,0
Which one? The one that says Eject or the one that says Trap Door?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, either one will do.",not spongebob,0
What I was saying was...  YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!!  And he always did.,not spongebob,0
Lies!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.",not spongebob,0
"Very touching, but completely false.",not spongebob,0
Don't know what you mean.,not spongebob,0
Why don't you tell them the truth?,not spongebob,0
"It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory.",not spongebob,0
"First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money!",not spongebob,0
But what about satisfying the customers?,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!",not spongebob,0
Gimme that!,not spongebob,0
"Stop, you're gonna bust it.",not spongebob,0
"This isn't about money, Eugene.",not spongebob,0
Malarkey.,not spongebob,0
YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!!  Ouch.   Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.",spongebob,1
That's because it isn't.,not spongebob,0
KAREN?!,not spongebob,0
"You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.",not spongebob,0
It was only our third date.,not spongebob,0
"Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks.",not spongebob,0
Now that's a handsome looking burger.,not spongebob,0
"You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?",not spongebob,0
What's that music?,not spongebob,0
I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins!,not spongebob,0
I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.,not spongebob,0
You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.,not spongebob,0
"Why, I'd be happy to!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Plab Patties KO Old Man J. I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.,not spongebob,0
"Well, he is old.",not spongebob,0
Hey. That guy is like family to me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.",not spongebob,0
You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger. (The Subtitles in Netflix reads You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in.),not spongebob,0
You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.,not spongebob,0
"No way, that recipe's mine!",not spongebob,0
"Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.",not spongebob,0
"Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.",not spongebob,0
"I think not, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
What?! Why I oughta squash you right now! You little...,not spongebob,0
Get out of my face!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look! Nerd fight.",not spongebob,0
I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.,not spongebob,0
"Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.",not spongebob,0
Big Johnny will eat anything.,not spongebob,0
"Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir.",not spongebob,0
Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.,not spongebob,0
"Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think!",not spongebob,0
I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.,not spongebob,0
"Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Flavor!,not spongebob,0
Edible!,not spongebob,0
We can actually hold it down!,not spongebob,0
This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!,not spongebob,0
"Yay, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
"I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do!",not spongebob,0
"Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!",not spongebob,0
You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!,not spongebob,0
You callin' me a liar?,not spongebob,0
Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship!,not spongebob,0
You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.,not spongebob,0
My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.,not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
"It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?",not spongebob,0
"I'd like that, Planky, old chum.",not spongebob,0
"Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?",spongebob,1
I suppose it would. If I had one.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Me, too. Me, too.",not spongebob,0
"Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy!",not spongebob,0
Sabotage!,spongebob,1
"Go, Karen!",not spongebob,0
"Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you got fired, too!",not spongebob,0
I got a golden parachute.,not spongebob,0
"Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.",not spongebob,0
Looks like they already did.,not spongebob,0
"What!? They let a smelly, hairy fleabag like that serve food?",not spongebob,0
Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, watch it, ape!",not spongebob,0
Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!,not spongebob,0
Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!",not spongebob,0
"And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed.",not spongebob,0
"Bikini Bottom Action News! Tonight's  top story: A wealthy entrepreneur, who wishes to remain  anonymous, is  sponsoring this year's  sleigh race. First prize:  one million dollars!  All of Bikini Bottom is entered, but only one hopeful will win. We join roving reporter  Perch Perkins live at the scene.",not spongebob,0
The tension's building up as the  contestants line up to win the prize.,not spongebob,0
"Gary and I are gonna  try to win the prize so Mr. Krabs can fix up the Krusty Krab.  Right, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want!  Good thing I brought out the heavy artillery  Gooey Worms!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick those don't move.",spongebob,1
Sure they do! Giddy up!  Hyah!  See?,not spongebob,0
"You don't stand a chance, Krabs! Karen and I--I mean, my worm and I are gonna whip your tail fin!  Right, worm?",not spongebob,0
Ruff ruff.,not spongebob,0
"And with the prize money, I'll topple your restaurant empire  once and for all!",not spongebob,0
"Ha! Where fetchin' money's involved, nobody topples me.",not spongebob,0
"Contestants, ready your sleds.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir.  How do you think you'll do in the race?",not spongebob,0
Hello out there Bikini Bottom!  I'm glad I can finally talk to my adoring fans on television!,not spongebob,0
"Best of luck to ya.  Oh, excuse me miss...",not spongebob,0
On your marks...,not spongebob,0
So long suckers.,not spongebob,0
"... get set,  go!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, wormies! Giddy up!  Hmm.",not spongebob,0
"Meanwhile, back in the lowlands...",not spongebob,0
"Alone at last!  Now, there's nothing between me and the secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"C'mon, boys! Get me to the greenbacks!",not spongebob,0
"I think not old man. Turbo boost, Karen!",not spongebob,0
No!  I can't let him win.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, he won't.  I will.  Yeehaw!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Hi Patrick. Where's your sleigh?,spongebob,1
I dunno.,not spongebob,0
Hop in. We'll give you a lift.  Come on Gary!,spongebob,1
Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.  Good thing I brought this along.  I'm gonna need something with more firepower.,not spongebob,0
Woo wee! Looks like I lost them!  The remote shorted out! The robots are stuck in high gear! Whoa!  Aaaa!,not spongebob,0
Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!,not spongebob,0
"(speaks in a British Accent) I beg your pardon. It's tea time, anyway.",not spongebob,0
I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts!' ',not spongebob,0
Whoa! Look at that!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Buddy!  He doesn't look so hot. We better take him with us.,spongebob,1
Good idea.,not spongebob,0
Meoow...,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, do you hear that?",spongebob,1
Sandy?,not spongebob,0
"Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.",not spongebob,0
"No problem, right, Gare?",spongebob,1
Meow...  Errrgg!,not spongebob,0
"Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest!",not spongebob,0
Heeelp!,not spongebob,0
Hi Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms!,not spongebob,0
"Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!",spongebob,1
"Much appreciate it, boy!",not spongebob,0
Faster! Faster! Faster!,not spongebob,0
Mooowww...,not spongebob,0
Faster! Faster!,not spongebob,0
Faster!,not spongebob,0
This is a dead end!,spongebob,1
Rooooooooarr!  Meow.,not spongebob,0
Great. Now we're trapped.,not spongebob,0
"Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...",not spongebob,0
It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!,not spongebob,0
Hey! How about a campfire song?,spongebob,1
No Singing!,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket.",not spongebob,0
"Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?",not spongebob,0
Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh!,not spongebob,0
Not you again!,not spongebob,0
Ha! Slimey snow vermin! You missed!,not spongebob,0
That's weren't the attack.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hit the deck!,not spongebob,0
Gary!,spongebob,1
Oh no... not again...,not spongebob,0
She's reloading! Now's our chance to scram.,not spongebob,0
What is that formidable creature?,spongebob,1
"That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.",not spongebob,0
I thought that was just a myth.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I assure you, she's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Twas back when I was young sea captain,  sailing in the Atlantic sea. When the behemith and i first tangled.",not spongebob,0
"Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!",spongebob,1
"Nope, that didn't work.  She gulped me and me crew down in one swift swallow.",not spongebob,0
"Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale.",spongebob,1
"Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course.",not spongebob,0
Hm? Oh! Ew.,spongebob,1
"I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today!",not spongebob,0
"Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!",spongebob,1
"Oh, be gentle, it's my last one!",not spongebob,0
Hold on tight!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here!,not spongebob,0
"Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh?  Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to weigh us down and make with the prize himself!",not spongebob,0
Argh argh argh! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish than share me winnings with y--,not spongebob,0
"We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"What's the big emergency, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
I saw something shiny.,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Well, let's just drop everything, then!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait, Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.",spongebob,1
Karen?,spongebob,1
I say she's in swift need of a reboot! Heee ya!,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Plankton?  Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.",spongebob,1
Well we gotta bust him out but quick! I'm gonna sit on him!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile.",spongebob,1
A simulacrum!,not spongebob,0
Sandy please! Language!,spongebob,1
"Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!",not spongebob,0
"That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact,  this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton.  With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected.",not spongebob,0
Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!,spongebob,1
And exactly how do you propose we find him?,not spongebob,0
"I saw Mr. Krabs pass by  just before my system failed, heading southwest.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!",spongebob,1
"Hehehehe!  Yeuch!  So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive!  Ahem! I meant destructive!",not spongebob,0
"Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...",not spongebob,0
"Attaboy, Gary!",spongebob,1
Ahhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, whew.",not spongebob,0
Cliff!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--...land?",spongebob,1
Fire in the hole!  Rats.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab!",not spongebob,0
I can't feel my looking holes!,not spongebob,0
The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach.,spongebob,1
"You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions.  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?",not spongebob,0
"I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary!",not spongebob,0
"Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch.",spongebob,1
"Great, now we're stuck.",not spongebob,0
"No, we're not!  Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.",spongebob,1
We must be heading in the right direction!,not spongebob,0
"Secret formula, you are mine!",not spongebob,0
"Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit!  Molecule by molecule!  Atom by atom!!  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
"Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, i'm trying to sleep.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? He froze up too.",not spongebob,0
Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?,not spongebob,0
And are you aware I just saved your life?,not spongebob,0
"The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings.",not spongebob,0
"Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!",not spongebob,0
Duped? You don't mean by...,not spongebob,0
Now you're putting it together!,not spongebob,0
My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!,not spongebob,0
We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.,not spongebob,0
We're doomed.,not spongebob,0
No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!,spongebob,1
"No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.",not spongebob,0
Just leave that to the scientist of the group!,not spongebob,0
Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?,not spongebob,0
Hahahaha!,not spongebob,0
She's all fired up!,not spongebob,0
"Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?",spongebob,1
Lookin' clear so far.,not spongebob,0
Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!,spongebob,1
One frozen wasteland later.,not spongebob,0
Hooray! We made it.,spongebob,1
Okay... then where's my restaurant?,not spongebob,0
Perhaps over there..,spongebob,1
And where's my formula?,not spongebob,0
Perhaps over there.,not spongebob,0
"The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?!",not spongebob,0
We're too late!,spongebob,1
We'll see about that boy-o!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!",not spongebob,0
This will only take a minute.,not spongebob,0
Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open.,not spongebob,0
Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!,not spongebob,0
Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?,not spongebob,0
I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's easy!",not spongebob,0
Patrick!,not spongebob,0
"Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy.",not spongebob,0
"That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.",not spongebob,0
"#160;: Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!",not spongebob,0
You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!,not spongebob,0
"Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon!",not spongebob,0
"Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Then hand over my formula.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools?",not spongebob,0
"You get back here, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
Here we go again...,not spongebob,0
Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!,not spongebob,0
"I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close.  So long, suckers!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hehehe!,not spongebob,0
We're trapped!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.",not spongebob,0
He's going to turn us into fried snacks!,not spongebob,0
Got any dipping sauce?,not spongebob,0
A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?,not spongebob,0
Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
Nom nom?,spongebob,1
Nom nom!  Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
"W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!",spongebob,1
"No, eat me!",not spongebob,0
"Don't eat me, eat Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, what?!",not spongebob,0
Nom nom!,not spongebob,0
"She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!",spongebob,1
I better go while the going's good.,not spongebob,0
Jellybean!,not spongebob,0
I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?",spongebob,1
He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties.  Huh?! What's this?",not spongebob,0
"Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Down there, sir!",not spongebob,0
There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress!  There can only be one culprit: Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win!",not spongebob,0
"He got away, sir.",not spongebob,0
No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!,not spongebob,0
"Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's...  ...SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
"A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!",spongebob,1
Yeehaw!,not spongebob,0
"Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.",spongebob,1
Argh! I can't take it!,not spongebob,0
Plankton! It's you!,spongebob,1
"Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.",spongebob,1
Wh-what did you say?,not spongebob,0
"I said, you're a--",spongebob,1
Loser!,not spongebob,0
"How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day.",not spongebob,0
"♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪",not spongebob,0
"I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.",spongebob,1
Which no... whatever.,not spongebob,0
A customer?  Our special today is chum...  ...balaya.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Plankton.",spongebob,1
Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?,not spongebob,0
No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Play with me.,spongebob,1
You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?,not spongebob,0
"No, but I like to go jelly...",spongebob,1
That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?,not spongebob,0
"You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!",not spongebob,0
Elaborate.,not spongebob,0
"Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!",not spongebob,0
Take the Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.",not spongebob,0
...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.,spongebob,1
"Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.",not spongebob,0
"Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net.",spongebob,1
What happens after we eat 'em?,not spongebob,0
"You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that.",spongebob,1
And?,not spongebob,0
And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!,spongebob,1
"Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!",not spongebob,0
"It's not about winning, it's about fun!",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...,spongebob,1
"What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪",spongebob,1
♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪,not spongebob,0
"♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪",not spongebob,0
"Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪",spongebob,1
Never! That's completely idiotic!,not spongebob,0
"Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!",spongebob,1
"♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪",not spongebob,0
♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪,not spongebob,0
"Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?",not spongebob,0
No! That's how you're suppose to feel!,spongebob,1
"Well, I like it. Let's do it again!",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪",not spongebob,0
"Arrgh, mutiny.",not spongebob,0
"And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...",not spongebob,0
Sounds like fun.,not spongebob,0
"Well, the really fun part was when we...",not spongebob,0
What did you do with the Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
The what?,not spongebob,0
"The Krabby Patty, remember?",not spongebob,0
"You can't rush these things, you know.",not spongebob,0
You're forgetting about the mission!,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
"You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself!",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.,not spongebob,0
Who knows? Maybe he's changed.,spongebob,1
Who knows? I think you knows!,not spongebob,0
"He's changed, I tell you!",spongebob,1
SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you?",not spongebob,0
"What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...",not spongebob,0
Why can't you just accept our friendship?,spongebob,1
"He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.",not spongebob,0
Uhh... suit yourself.,not spongebob,0
"We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here.",spongebob,1
"Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin!",not spongebob,0
"I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey, Bubble Bass!",spongebob,1
"Thanks for that, friend.",not spongebob,0
Sure thing.,spongebob,1
Listen up!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy!",not spongebob,0
I can't believe this!,spongebob,1
It's not what you think.,not spongebob,0
What is it then? Tell me what you see here!,spongebob,1
I... I don't see anything.,not spongebob,0
How can you not see it!?,spongebob,1
"Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it.",not spongebob,0
But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?,spongebob,1
How long what?,not spongebob,0
How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!,spongebob,1
What?!,spongebob,1
"All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.",spongebob,1
"Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.",spongebob,1
"Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Well, maybe on a discount.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Gary! What are you doing!?,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow, meow...",not spongebob,0
"What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!",not spongebob,0
"Is something wrong, Patrick?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What is that?,not spongebob,0
What's what?,spongebob,1
This!,not spongebob,0
"P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?",spongebob,1
Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!,not spongebob,0
Good idea!,spongebob,1
"Uhh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
I don't know about this!,not spongebob,0
What makes you say that?,spongebob,1
This.,not spongebob,0
"Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Sure do! Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  Itch!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind!  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?,not spongebob,0
All what-y?,spongebob,1
"Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all!",spongebob,1
That's no blemish!,not spongebob,0
Help… Me!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll help you, alright!",not spongebob,0
S.W.A.T. Team.  We'll be right over!,not spongebob,0
Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet.,not spongebob,0
"Stop, you fool!  Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.",not spongebob,0
"Get back! I said, get back! Back I say!",not spongebob,0
"What's going on, Squidward? Help!",spongebob,1
"Here's your change, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, why thank you very much, young man.",not spongebob,0
"What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick.",not spongebob,0
Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home!,spongebob,1
"You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.",not spongebob,0
"Where's my snail, Gary?",spongebob,1
We've taken care of your pet.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Gary? Whoa!,spongebob,1
"He appears stable, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, boys, let's pack it up.",not spongebob,0
Wow!  Huh? What is this?,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!,spongebob,1
Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!",spongebob,1
"Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?",not spongebob,0
Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?,spongebob,1
I win! I win! I win!,not spongebob,0
Patrick?,spongebob,1
"Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.,spongebob,1
I've got an idea!,not spongebob,0
"There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh? Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work!",spongebob,1
Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.",not spongebob,0
Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…,not spongebob,0
"If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids.",not spongebob,0
Ahh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!",not spongebob,0
What's all the commotion about?,not spongebob,0
"The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.",not spongebob,0
"Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.",spongebob,1
"Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?",not spongebob,0
We are!,not spongebob,0
It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!,not spongebob,0
No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!,not spongebob,0
Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!  NOOOOO!,spongebob,1
"Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"It's not me, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?,spongebob,1
"He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Me next!,not spongebob,0
Where are your manners? It's ladies first!,not spongebob,0
I believe the expression is starfish first.,not spongebob,0
I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!",not spongebob,0
Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive.  I'll take two, please.",not spongebob,0
Alright!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!",spongebob,1
"Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"What do you want, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar.",spongebob,1
More like another nickel.,not spongebob,0
"Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel.",spongebob,1
It's not that funny.,not spongebob,0
"It's funny, because it's true!",spongebob,1
Move over.,not spongebob,0
Nickel.,spongebob,1
Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow.",spongebob,1
And always check for spare change.,not spongebob,0
"Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Another day, another nickel.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!",not spongebob,0
I don't?,spongebob,1
No. You should sit down.,not spongebob,0
But...,spongebob,1
"Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I am?,spongebob,1
"Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, a little.",spongebob,1
And your temperature is 175 degrees!,not spongebob,0
It's that bad?,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.",not spongebob,0
"I have been laughing a lot, lately.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're going to burn out your laugh box.",not spongebob,0
My laugh box?,spongebob,1
"Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.",not spongebob,0
"Is that what happened to you, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, you want to hear a joke?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"Sure, I'd love a good laugh.",spongebob,1
What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck!,not spongebob,0
"I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.",not spongebob,0
How long do I have to avoid laughing?,spongebob,1
"Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, banana peel, don't!",spongebob,1
What'd you say?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what the...",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!",spongebob,1
Right foot first...,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.",spongebob,1
"You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out.",not spongebob,0
"Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!",spongebob,1
Look out for that pie truck!,not spongebob,0
"I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!",spongebob,1
What happened?,not spongebob,0
I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.,spongebob,1
"Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match.",not spongebob,0
Come in.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"What's wrong, boy?",not spongebob,0
I lost my laugh.,spongebob,1
"You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?",not spongebob,0
Not really.,spongebob,1
This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.,not spongebob,0
Nothing.,spongebob,1
"Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.",not spongebob,0
Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist.,spongebob,1
"Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?",not spongebob,0
"The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.",spongebob,1
"But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.",not spongebob,0
Sounds painful.,spongebob,1
"Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.",not spongebob,0
I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again.,spongebob,1
I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy.,not spongebob,0
Later that same evening...,not spongebob,0
"I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.",not spongebob,0
"But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!",not spongebob,0
You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.,spongebob,1
"(taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.",not spongebob,0
I could laugh the whole time?,spongebob,1
Yeah.  You really fell for it.,not spongebob,0
I guess I did.,spongebob,1
You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine.,not spongebob,0
"It's really not that funny, Squidward.",spongebob,1
It's hilarious!,not spongebob,0
"See ya later, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel.  yahhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Look, he's waking up.",not spongebob,0
(groans) Where am I?,not spongebob,0
"You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.",not spongebob,0
"The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.",not spongebob,0
So they cut it out.,not spongebob,0
Cut it out?!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.",not spongebob,0
Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?,not spongebob,0
Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.,not spongebob,0
"But, you cut out my laugh box.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.",not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
They wouldn't pay me.,not spongebob,0
You're getting warmer.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world.",spongebob,1
Batter up!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, oh.",spongebob,1
"I got it, I got it!",not spongebob,0
Wah!,spongebob,1
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!,not spongebob,0
"Just treasuring our time together, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!",not spongebob,0
I can't do it! I can't be away from my best friend!,not spongebob,0
"No, it hurts too much!",spongebob,1
"Oh, will you two cut it out?",not spongebob,0
"Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!",spongebob,1
It is?,not spongebob,0
Wow! My turn!,not spongebob,0
I think I'm gonna be sick!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Patrick. Now we never have to be apart,  even when we're not together.",spongebob,1
"This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, see you forever, Patrick.  Time for bed, Tiny Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Uh.  Oh.,not spongebob,0
Ah.  Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Says who?,not spongebob,0
"You sit right there, my hungry little sailor, while I whip you up some grub from the galley.",spongebob,1
"Dah, uh-huh.",not spongebob,0
Ah.,not spongebob,0
Ahh. Hmm?  Ahhh! Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot.",spongebob,1
Ohhh.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
Whee-ah!,not spongebob,0
"Stop!  Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm.  Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done.  Ah-yah.",spongebob,1
0 and Patrick bangs on it to stop. Patrick and Mini SpongeBob stretch and yawn.],not spongebob,0
Good morning.,not spongebob,0
Didn't think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did!,not spongebob,0
"Brushy, brushy, brushy.",spongebob,1
"Come on, Tiny SpongeBob. You gotta lift with your back.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh. Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, hi.",spongebob,1
Eeh.  Hmm. Hmm.,not spongebob,0
"So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, well, me and Tiny SpongeBob,  we're pretty busy tonight, so good night.",not spongebob,0
Good night.,spongebob,1
"I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam.",spongebob,1
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Hey. Didn't you used to have one two...two arms? Okay, little buddy. Let's find that arm of yours. Oh.  Oh.  Nope.  Nope. Hmm.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Ah!,not spongebob,0
Nope.  Oh. Ah-ha! I got it!  I'll fix you up in no time.  Good as new.,not spongebob,0
Ehh. Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, good night.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Oh?,not spongebob,0
Ding!  Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward, extra mayo, I heard you.",spongebob,1
"Oh, hi, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I don't remember us having a sleepover last night.,spongebob,1
"What's going on, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, little guys. You're playing with each other. So cute.",spongebob,1
Whew.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, ah.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"What are they doing, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives.",spongebob,1
Poor little guys.,spongebob,1
"Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.",not spongebob,0
"You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Ta-da! A tiny house for my tiny friend.,spongebob,1
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it!",not spongebob,0
"Nice work, Patrick. Whoops!  Almost forgot.  You've got to have a Gare-Bear.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yay!",not spongebob,0
Ohh.  Huh?,not spongebob,0
Aww.  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Let's leave 'em alone, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Ah, too bright.  Oh, those two again!",not spongebob,0
What the—,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"No, get away. Get away!",not spongebob,0
"Howdy, neighbor. It's your old pal, Sandy Cheeks with a true to life tale direct from Bikini Bottom. It's the end of another long day, and every critter in town is getting ready to hit the hay.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
Even little old SpongeBob and Gary are laying down their weary heads.,not spongebob,0
Night Gare-bear.,spongebob,1
"Now snails love to sleep, but they also like to have their fun. And clever little Gary here is no different.  With a dang nifty decoy in place, Gary is ready to hit the town.",not spongebob,0
"But first things first. That gooey little varmint is mighty hungry.  It may not look like much to you and me, but this here is four-star dining to a snail.",not spongebob,0
"Now, Gary never minds running into a friend, but old Patrick here don't seem ready to share his meal.",not spongebob,0
"Ol' Gary feels as big as a ten-point buck right now, but he's about to be reminded that life ain't all fun and games. Especially when animal control is on your tail.",not spongebob,0
"Freeze, slime ball!",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"As much as Gary likes getting one over on the heat, he has more important matters to attend to.",not spongebob,0
"This here is old Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket. Gary ain't here for vittles, though. No one's ever at the Chum Bucket for vittles.",not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
That there's Spot. Plankton's pet amoeba and Gary's best friend.,not spongebob,0
Psst.,not spongebob,0
"Spot's cute, but about as dumb as a barrel of hair.  Gary better think quick or they'll both be busted before their night's even begun.",not spongebob,0
Ough!,not spongebob,0
"Ol' Gary and Spot have been sneaking out for ages though their owners are none the wiser.  They love playing all sorts of games together, but their doggone favorite is wrestling.",not spongebob,0
It's the Krusty Krab kitchen. What a stroke of luck.,not spongebob,0
Gary and Spot must have worked up quite an appetite with all them fun and games.,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. That ice box is locked up tighter than a horse thief in a hoosegow.,not spongebob,0
Oh boy. It's chow time.,not spongebob,0
Whoo-whee! Looks like Gary is cooking up some fun.,not spongebob,0
"It may not be pretty, but to a critter, chow is chow.",not spongebob,0
"Come out, come out.  Oh, there you are.  Ha ha! I've got you this time.",not spongebob,0
Ahem.,not spongebob,0
"Animal control, citizen. I'm hunting an errant snail.",not spongebob,0
"I don't give a sea fig about snails! You tripped me silent alarm!  Just look at this mess!  Take that, you varmint!  Take that!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Ow! Ow!,not spongebob,0
Looks like our boys gave Johnny law the slip again.  Reckon they're gonna need some place to lay low for a while.,not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. Looks like their hiding spot's already occupado.,not spongebob,0
"Luckily for them, Gary and Spot are already pals with everyone here.",not spongebob,0
Let's get this party started!,not spongebob,0
Uh oh. Looks like the fuzz ain't gonna give up so easy.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is my jam.",not spongebob,0
They say that music soothes the savage beast.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
But sometimes it works on knuckleheads too.,not spongebob,0
"That's how you do it. You do it. You do it.  Uh, you animals are under arrest?  Uh... Uh oh.",not spongebob,0
Youch! That's gotta hurt. Oh mama!,not spongebob,0
"I guess this party just got pooped.  Luckily, SpongeBob's little Gare-bear always has something under his shell.",not spongebob,0
Locked doors are never a problem for a snail like Gary.,not spongebob,0
"Now to most animals, the pound is scarier than a bobcat in your long johns. But Gary and Spot are on a mission to save their pals.",not spongebob,0
Ah-ha!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Meow! Shhh!,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Marvin, you can catch every snail in Bikini Bottom, but the only thing you've really caught is loneliness.  And kennel cough.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Marvin here ain't kith nor kin to Gary, but that don't matter none. Gary could never bear to see anyone looking so down.",not spongebob,0
I need another snot rag.,not spongebob,0
Hey! How did you animals get out?,not spongebob,0
Wh—wh—what's going on?,not spongebob,0
Et voilà.,not spongebob,0
She's beautiful.,not spongebob,0
Oh! That's so good!,not spongebob,0
I do.,not spongebob,0
I can't thank you all enough. You brought love into my lonely life. Everybody's free to go.,not spongebob,0
Why am I running?,not spongebob,0
"With their friends rescued, it's time for our boys to finally get some shut eye.",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"After his long night of adventuring, Gary is more tired than a bronco on busting day.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up.",spongebob,1
"Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt.",spongebob,1
"Well, that's the long and short of it. See y'all next time for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
Shh!,not spongebob,0
Help! Help!,not spongebob,0
Monica!,not spongebob,0
Brad!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Monica, I've thought I might never find you.  I promise to never leave you at your side.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Brad.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Monica.",not spongebob,0
"Do you know what today is, little guy?",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
It's take Gary a walk in a park day!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down for a sec.",spongebob,1
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
Meooow.,not spongebob,0
MREOOOW REOOOOW REOOOW REOOOW! OOF!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, lightweight! What do you think you're doing with my girl?  Come on, Mary, let's go.",not spongebob,0
Mreoooow.,not spongebob,0
"You've just made a big mistake, pal.",not spongebob,0
Grrrrr...,not spongebob,0
"Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner!",spongebob,1
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
Meoooow.,not spongebob,0
"Let's go, Mary.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I get through with yous, the doctor won't know which side to sow your lips back on... to!  That little runt is going to get what's coming to him!",not spongebob,0
Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love.  Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out.",spongebob,1
"One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye!  Night-night, Gare-Bear.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, Gary!  Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. It was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night.  Peek-a-boo!  Huh? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself.  What's this? Some sort of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover!  Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Meeooooooooow...,not spongebob,0
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
"After me, fellas.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, how come we never go through the front, guys?",not spongebob,0
'Cause the bad guys don't never use the front door!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I think that that's pretty ridiculous.",not spongebob,0
"All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... yay tall, a shell, couple of eyes?",not spongebob,0
I think you need to be more descriptive.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail thinks it's real funny to make goo-goo eyes on my girl.  Hey! What-- they's giggling at! They's giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You's all going on my list! You's got that? You're all on the list!",not spongebob,0
"Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy?  Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's.  Sounds right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test.  Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary!",spongebob,1
"Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray?  There now. Isn't that better?",not spongebob,0
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
Meow meow meow meow?,not spongebob,0
"No. No, I haven't seen any stray snails come in here.",not spongebob,0
"He's trying to pull a fast one, fellas.  Why don't we give him a taste of our special brand of swift justice?!",not spongebob,0
Two hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Heh! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a thorough job.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Let's get back to finding that snail.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Boss, there's one left.",not spongebob,0

"Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!",spongebob,1
Snailnapper?  I don't want your dumb ol' snail.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?",spongebob,1
Meow meow meow meow. Meow.,not spongebob,0

"That's gotta hurt, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow reow.,not spongebob,0
"Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can get some seaweed noodle stew!",not spongebob,0
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Don't stay out too late, Gary!  They grow up so fast.",spongebob,1
"Okay, that's enough stretching.",spongebob,1

"I don't care if he turned into a bucket of chum. I need me fry cook!  Mr. Squidward, you have the helm.",not spongebob,0
Attention Krusty Krab customers: Get out. It's time for my break.,not spongebob,0

"And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.",spongebob,1
"Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls.",not spongebob,0
Good Ol' Dutchie!,spongebob,1
"Squidward, my man, you are perfect!  Oh, no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry, fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up.  Kelp Grow! Hold still.",not spongebob,0

"Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.",spongebob,1

"Okay, okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out.  I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Then have some more!  Still want that ice cream?,not spongebob,0
"Boy, I do! Thanks, Squidward. Want some, SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam!",not spongebob,0

Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Patrick. You know, my shoes feel kinda tight.  Huh, nice and roomy.",spongebob,1
Do you want your grow juice back?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Give me that!,not spongebob,0
But you said you didn't want it.,not spongebob,0
Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?,not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'll go first.",not spongebob,0
What did you do?,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0

Meow.,not spongebob,0
There he is.,spongebob,1
Get ready.,not spongebob,0
"Now, Patrick!  There you go, Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make big money.  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.",spongebob,1
"You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!",not spongebob,0
"I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But time's a wasting! We need another good deed!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I got one! Um...you know that thing?",not spongebob,0
"Um, right, that thing that we did that day.",spongebob,1
"No, the other one. Um...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!",not spongebob,0
Are you sure?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, you'd be ugly again.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'm sure!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, how to fix his nose?",spongebob,1
"What if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it will shrink it?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's brilliant!",spongebob,1
"No, wait, don't.",not spongebob,0
That didn't work.,spongebob,1
"Well, try it again.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm. I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.",spongebob,1
Now his body is too small.,not spongebob,0
"Right, too small.",spongebob,1
Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!,not spongebob,0
I look horrible!,not spongebob,0

Scoop out his... eyeballs and use 'em as... giant... misshapen soccer balls!,not spongebob,0
"Wait. Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.",spongebob,1
"Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.",not spongebob,0
Even though you really wanted to.,spongebob,1
"Oh, quiet, you moron!",not spongebob,0
He hurt the little one's feelings.,not spongebob,0
"Why, that's not very nice at all.",not spongebob,0
"Take him down, boys!",not spongebob,0

Compliment me on my new hairdo?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure, whatever.",not spongebob,0

He taught my grandmother how to read!,not spongebob,0
He helped me start my own blimp ride company.,not spongebob,0
He helped me build a... a...,not spongebob,0
Bless you. Gesundheit.  Ahem?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
He didn't say bless you.,not spongebob,0

"Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet!",not spongebob,0
"Well, Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Where are you?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button.",spongebob,1
What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.",spongebob,1
So?,not spongebob,0
We shall do him another.  We did it!,spongebob,1
What the?,not spongebob,0
"Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one.",spongebob,1
"A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?",not spongebob,0
We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet.,spongebob,1
"Yee-haw! Get along, little amoebas!  I did it! It's sarsaparilla time!  Holy osmosis! I lived as an amoeba for a whole week!",not spongebob,0
"Can't get it to work, can never get it to work!",not spongebob,0

Whoo.,not spongebob,0
"Tell her I said, Hi!",spongebob,1
"Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, Hi!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Y'all are never gonna believe what I did this week. It's about as crazy as a mule with a top hat!,not spongebob,0
Was it crazier than this?  Tell her I said 'Hi!' Tell her I said 'Hi!',not spongebob,0
"Sorry you day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week!",not spongebob,0
"That's great, Sandy, but I've lived with a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today. He leaves his little telescope on the floor,  I rolled over it. It hurt like heck! And then, he gets mad at me for breaking it. Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car!  I'm going crazy!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're supposed to be having a good 'ol time, not a good 'ol cry.",not spongebob,0
I'm having a good time.,not spongebob,0
Me too.,not spongebob,0
"Look, guys. This is a girls night out. And I'm gonna make sure we have more fun than three rats in a pickle barrel!  Gal pals unite!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
"So, let me get this straight. Pranking Plankton will make me feel better?",not spongebob,0
You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking.,not spongebob,0
"Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.",not spongebob,0
Ready?  Yah!,not spongebob,0
"Ouch!  Krabs?! If I wasn't on probation, I'd call the cops!",not spongebob,0
"Plank-ter-ren, me old nemesis-ser!  I've got good news-erer: I'm leaving town and going back into the Navery, so I'm giving you me secret formuler-er-rer!",not spongebob,0
What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it!,not spongebob,0
It's a going away gift-erer.,not spongebob,0
I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er.,not spongebob,0
"I'll meet you there, Eugene honey!  Kiss!",not spongebob,0
I think he bought it.,not spongebob,0
Psst! Come on!,not spongebob,0
Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa!,not spongebob,0
I'm here!,not spongebob,0
Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way.",not spongebob,0
Over my dead body!,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you say, Welcher!",not spongebob,0
"Y'know, you're right, Sandy. I do feel so much better!",not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable.,not spongebob,0
Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Mm. Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Virtual reality helmet, engaged.",not spongebob,0
"Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up.",not spongebob,0
Huh? C-coming!,spongebob,1
Hello? Can I help you?,spongebob,1
"Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license.  Congratulations.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, thanks— My driver's license!",spongebob,1
And your new boat!,not spongebob,0
"My new boat!  Whoa, wow!  Am I dreaming?  Nope, it's for real.  Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving!",spongebob,1
"Oh! That voice. Yes, you're driving! You're driving me crazy!  I know! Let's make the road really bumpy!",not spongebob,0
"Wha-what? Whoa!  Whoa! Ow!  Hm, those are some potholes.",spongebob,1
"Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke.",not spongebob,0
Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob— SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Poor little guy! This is all my fault!,not spongebob,0
"No, Puff! This is all my fault!",not spongebob,0
Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
"Not now, Karen!",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Look out!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving!  Look, I got a license.  Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road!  near a construction site]",spongebob,1
"We gotta stop this cart, gal pals!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Whoa!  I'll save you, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Now I'm flying!  Whee!,spongebob,1
"Huh? Huh? Huh.  Huh?  Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly... Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! No!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, you girls got me again!  Vroom! Vroom!",spongebob,1
I know somewhere where we can finish our ladies night in peace.,not spongebob,0
"Good one.  This was a great idea, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, what a nice place to relax.",not spongebob,0
"Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving!",spongebob,1
Men.  Gal pals!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?,spongebob,1
"Man! That has to be the worst amusement park I have ever been to! I mean, we're lucky to escape with our lives!",not spongebob,0
I agree! The world will be a much better place when Glove World is gone for good!,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, did you just mention Glove World?",spongebob,1
Yeah. Glove World. They're gonna close it. Tomorrow! Forever!,not spongebob,0
Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!,spongebob,1
"Well, that depends on your definition.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, I gotta go.",spongebob,1
Wh-wh-wh what about our lemonade?,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"I can't come out now, SpongeBob. I'm taking a shower.",not spongebob,0
"But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna...",spongebob,1
Glove World?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, wait!",spongebob,1
"There it is, Patrick. Glove World.",spongebob,1
"Look at that guy, he must be the owner.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World forever.",spongebob,1
Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!,not spongebob,0
"Here, son, take this. You don't wanna catch cold.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, it feels good.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, that looks glovely on you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Fits like a glove.,not spongebob,0
Glove size fits all.,spongebob,1
A penny saved is a penny gloved!,not spongebob,0
"You can leave a glove to gloves, but you can't make it glove.",spongebob,1
"She gloves me, she gloves me not.",not spongebob,0
All's fair in glove and war.,spongebob,1
Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.,not spongebob,0
"Well, enjoy the hat. Now if you folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.",not spongebob,0
"Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!",spongebob,1
Yep.,not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
"I understand your concern, but really...",not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.",spongebob,1
For all time's ride sake.,not spongebob,0
"Well, seeing as it's our last day of operation anyway, and as long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure, go right ahead!",not spongebob,0
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl.",spongebob,1
"Goodbye, Tilt-A-Hurl.",not spongebob,0
Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
We'll miss you.,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, Glove Drop.",spongebob,1
So many fun memories on this ride.,not spongebob,0
"I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave.  Where to next, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I think you know where, pal.",not spongebob,0
The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in the entire glove kingdom. And it's the last time I'm ever gonna ride it.,spongebob,1
"Come on, buddy. Let's take our seats.",not spongebob,0
Wee.,not spongebob,0
"I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World close?",spongebob,1
Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel.,not spongebob,0
"Ew, did you hear that?",spongebob,1
Excuse me.,not spongebob,0
"No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!",spongebob,1
Oh no! What am I looking at?,not spongebob,0
The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it moorings!,spongebob,1
Then you mean...,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"It somehow ripped free of it moorings!  SpongeBob, what are you doing? We must remain seated at all times!",not spongebob,0
We have to jump before this thing crashes! Come on!,spongebob,1
Bu-bu-bu-bu? But you know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!",spongebob,1
"I uh, oh, if you say so.",not spongebob,0
"Nice job, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Look!  Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.",spongebob,1
That's really gonna spoil the view for the residents of Glove Castle.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.",spongebob,1
"We've gone this far, why start now?",not spongebob,0
All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World is closing. I mean just look around you. Open your eyes.,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Move it, slowpoke!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, who you calling slowpoke, you sardine!",not spongebob,0
"See what I mean, Patrick? Glove World is on its last legs.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, or on its last finger.",not spongebob,0
I just wish there was something we can do.,spongebob,1
I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World to cheer ourselves up.,not spongebob,0
Wait a second.  That's it!,spongebob,1
It is?,not spongebob,0
"Of course, we just have to fix Glove World.",spongebob,1
We do?,not spongebob,0
"Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World open. Are you with me?",spongebob,1
"I think so. Yeah, I'm here.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, this is it. Do you remember what to say?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...",not spongebob,0
Hall of mirrors.,spongebob,1
Hall of Mirrors!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, new and improved?  Wow, that's fantastic!",not spongebob,0
It's working.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll try it.  Hey! What kind of mirror is this!?",not spongebob,0
Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm glad they're closing this place down!,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, kid.  Ow! You little brat! I have had it! Three and a half weeks of working here and this is how I'm treated!? You're gonna have to pay for my shin-replacement surgery!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry you feel that way, but if we were to accommodate every employee-",not spongebob,0
"Accommodate this, boss man!",not spongebob,0
Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Owner, Mr. Owner! Can I wear the Glovey Glove costume? Please, please? I've always wanted to try it on. And also, this hat you lent me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See?",not spongebob,0
"Well, sure, why not? I mean, what could go wrong?",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, little boy.",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh! Glove ice cream!  Thanks!",not spongebob,0
"The park mascot, cutting in line?",not spongebob,0
And he stole my ice cream!,not spongebob,0
I thought he gave it to me.,not spongebob,0
"Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix.  Excuse me.  Much better.  Ooh.  There.",spongebob,1
"Huh? Hey, I landed safely!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, we landed safely!",not spongebob,0
He's insane! Run for your lives!,not spongebob,0
Come back here!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, stop! What are you doing?",spongebob,1
I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Patrick, do you hear that?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's the sound of total silence.  Plus tumbleweeds.",not spongebob,0
"Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World, and now it's over. And they're gonna close it, and there's nothing we can do.",spongebob,1
"Well, there is one thing we can do.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
"We're doing what any concerned, responsible person does when they're left no other choice.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, brother! We're chaining ourselves to a gate.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I hope you don't plan on staying chained for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.",not spongebob,0
The grand what?,not spongebob,0
"The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself.",not spongebob,0
Glove Universe?!,not spongebob,0
"Isn't she something?  Well, you two have a good night.",not spongebob,0
"Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!",spongebob,1
You bet!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.",spongebob,1
What key?,not spongebob,0
The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.,spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you told me to keep that in a safe place, remember?",not spongebob,0
So where you keeping it?,spongebob,1
At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will ever find it!  SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone, too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise?  No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you, Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again!  Ooh, my driver's license!  That's the baby.  Hi, fella, it's me.  It's okay, I'm licensed.  Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la-  -la-la-la...  Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  No!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-!  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke.",spongebob,1
You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you.,not spongebob,0
"Who, Boaty?  Oh no. He's... Really?",spongebob,1
I can't talk now. He's watching us.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick! Don't go!  Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed.",spongebob,1
Three days later...,not spongebob,0
"Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?",spongebob,1
"Sheesh. Calm down, boy.",not spongebob,0
"You're all still alive? Well, where did you go?",spongebob,1
It was National No SpongeBob Day.,not spongebob,0
National No SpongeBob Day?,spongebob,1
Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you.,not spongebob,0
A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks.,spongebob,1
Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little.,not spongebob,0
"You too, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from...,not spongebob,0
I'm... glad you had fun.,spongebob,1
"Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"Of course.  First, we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground.  Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby!  And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Wow. A whole day dedicated to me.,spongebob,1
"Big deal. Wait 'til you see No Patrick Day. Come on, everyone. Let's go!  Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh.",spongebob,1
"No, no, just—",not spongebob,0
Whoa.,spongebob,1
"It's harder to walk, but worth it.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.",spongebob,1
So many flavors.,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?",spongebob,1
"No, that's too fancy.",not spongebob,0
Rocky road!,not spongebob,0
With real rocks!,not spongebob,0
"Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.",spongebob,1
Bump.  When did food get so ugly?,not spongebob,0
"Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier. Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.",not spongebob,0
"Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!",not spongebob,0
"So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?",not spongebob,0
Call me Don.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir.",not spongebob,0
Ooh. Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-",spongebob,1
Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.,not spongebob,0
"The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time,  like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, oh, it's absolutely...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course...",not spongebob,0
Just gross.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, no, it's disgusting.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't think old is gross.",not spongebob,0
"Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!",not spongebob,0
"Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.",not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible.  Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty.  And finally, Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!",spongebob,1
"Oh, uh, Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice.",spongebob,1
"Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
"The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.",not spongebob,0
Me!,spongebob,1
Someone everyone can relate to...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, me, me!",spongebob,1
"With a face that says, I love Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"We find that face, and we have our campaign.",not spongebob,0
And I've got the perfect guy for the job.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that was my slogan.",spongebob,1
"Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!",not spongebob,0
I'm already a star.,not spongebob,0
That's the attitude.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.",not spongebob,0
I—oh...,spongebob,1
"Don, will this commercial really help me make money?",not spongebob,0
"You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.",not spongebob,0
"I told you, call me Don.",not spongebob,0
Don.,not spongebob,0
"Of course, you could double, maybe even triple or quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.",not spongebob,0
What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?,not spongebob,0
"Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.",not spongebob,0
How much a lot more?,not spongebob,0
A lot a lot more.,not spongebob,0
"Well, then let's fill her up with filler!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?",spongebob,1
"Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.",not spongebob,0
But what is filler?,spongebob,1
"Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?",not spongebob,0
"Ho-ho, that sounds great!",not spongebob,0
"Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smell like money?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, why does that barrel say sand?",spongebob,1
"Well, it's imported. It's spelled sand but it's pronounced, filler.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.",not spongebob,0
Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.,not spongebob,0
"Would you buy it, though?",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy  Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.",not spongebob,0
He loves it.,not spongebob,0
"Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"I'm rich, boy-o, rich!",not spongebob,0
"Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?",spongebob,1
"Yes, yes, we can.",not spongebob,0
"Hooray, finally!",spongebob,1
"Whatcha doing, boy?",not spongebob,0
Making Krabby Patties.,spongebob,1
"Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
You mean my last one for the morning rush?,spongebob,1
"No, ever.",not spongebob,0
You mean my last one for today-ever?,spongebob,1
"No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
Fired?,spongebob,1
But I'm ready to re-hire you.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.",spongebob,1
Then follow me.,not spongebob,0
This tastes nice.,not spongebob,0
"Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.",not spongebob,0
You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?,spongebob,1
"That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?",spongebob,1
"Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.",not spongebob,0
Ding.,not spongebob,0
"You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, it's so convenient, see?",not spongebob,0
And what about me?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
"Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?",not spongebob,0
"Heh! No, you're just fired.",not spongebob,0
"What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  Dear Mr. Krabs—",not spongebob,0
"Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.",not spongebob,0
"What the—what?!  I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!",not spongebob,0
"Ahem,  hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.",spongebob,1
"Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.",spongebob,1
"Atta boy, embrace the future!",not spongebob,0
Going up?,not spongebob,0
I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.,spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again.,spongebob,1
You should get out. Now.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.",spongebob,1
"Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I don't know.",not spongebob,0
It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.,not spongebob,0
"I'll come with you, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.,not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
Aww.,not spongebob,0
"This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?",not spongebob,0
The next day...,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, oof!",spongebob,1
Ow.,not spongebob,0
Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.,spongebob,1
"I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.",not spongebob,0
I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.,spongebob,1
I love my job. Thanks for coming!,not spongebob,0
Totally out of character.,not spongebob,0
"I hate everyone.  Huh, much better.",not spongebob,0
Later...,not spongebob,0
Tastes so nice that they—,not spongebob,0
They taste like lice!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
What are you doing with this—ow!,not spongebob,0
Tastes so nice that they taste nice.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?",spongebob,1
"Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure. I get it.",spongebob,1
But he's my friend.,not spongebob,0
You're a star. You have no friends.,not spongebob,0
What am I doing again?,not spongebob,0
Stand over here and say your line. And...action.,not spongebob,0
"Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...",not spongebob,0
"And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.,not spongebob,0
Speak for yourself.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!",spongebob,1
"Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.",not spongebob,0
"See you later, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"Finally, now is my chance to strike.",not spongebob,0
Welcome to the original Krusty—,spongebob,1
"Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.",not spongebob,0
"Pfft, never happened.",not spongebob,0
Now to make my escape.,not spongebob,0
Aren't you gonna try and stop me?,not spongebob,0
"That'll be $1.99, please.",spongebob,1
"What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.",not spongebob,0
Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.,spongebob,1
See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!,spongebob,1
"Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.",not spongebob,0
Ding.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, you fools!",not spongebob,0
Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?",spongebob,1
"Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.",spongebob,1
Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?,not spongebob,0
Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.,spongebob,1
"Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?",not spongebob,0
That's it! I can't take it anymore! Everybody out!,not spongebob,0
I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.,not spongebob,0
"Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.",spongebob,1
Patrick!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!",spongebob,1
I thought they tasted familiar!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Missed you.,spongebob,1
I missed you too.,not spongebob,0
"I got something for you, from one friend to another.",spongebob,1
"No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!",not spongebob,0
"Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.",not spongebob,0
"Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand?,not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.",not spongebob,0
"And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...",not spongebob,0
That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...,not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.",spongebob,1
...Made with sand!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
That was cute when you were rich.  I'm out of here.,not spongebob,0
"And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?",not spongebob,0
Now that's the taste I remember.,not spongebob,0
That's strange.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?",not spongebob,0
"Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, did you do all this?",not spongebob,0
"Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.",spongebob,1
"A friend always helps. It's called frelping, and I was very frelpful.",not spongebob,0
But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.,not spongebob,0
"The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.",spongebob,1
Fresh?,not spongebob,0
"Go on, have a bite.",spongebob,1
"No, no I—",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.",spongebob,1
Here!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing, we're not selling them.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, we just give them away.",not spongebob,0
"Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?",not spongebob,0
Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!,spongebob,1
"Great, now get back to work!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob...,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!",not spongebob,0
I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.,spongebob,1
"Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.",not spongebob,0
"My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.",spongebob,1
"You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.",not spongebob,0
"What's that, Squidward?",spongebob,1
It's Sunday!  A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!,not spongebob,0
"Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgot his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him.  Man this is heavy.  Oh, pardon me.",spongebob,1
"Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!",not spongebob,0
AHH!!! Monster!,spongebob,1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!,not spongebob,0
"Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday.  My Sunday relaxation kit.  Let's see…pillow.  Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance.  Ah, and the final touch.  Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man.  This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot.  Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder, take me on a chocolate vacation.",not spongebob,0
Ooooooooohhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
Ooooooohhhhh!,spongebob,1
"By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.",not spongebob,0
What are you two idiots doing?,not spongebob,0
Secret ritual.,not spongebob,0
To inaugurate you as president.,spongebob,1
Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.,not spongebob,0
"No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.",not spongebob,0
Better?,not spongebob,0
You're the president of The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge!,spongebob,1
"The WHAT?! Oh, is this some stupid club you two made up?!",not spongebob,0
Hehehehe...maybe.,not spongebob,0
It's a secret.,spongebob,1
"Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer?  Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays.",not spongebob,0
"What color should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?",spongebob,1
Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.,not spongebob,0
Wow. Polka dots.,not spongebob,0
Our new president is a genius.,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"See ya later, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Whenever you're ready, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hold still, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.",spongebob,1
Okie dokie.,not spongebob,0
"Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.",not spongebob,0
Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.,not spongebob,0
What's going on out there?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the-",spongebob,1
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! MY EYES!!,not spongebob,0
Look out!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you poor man.",not spongebob,0
You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.,not spongebob,0
"No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh…",not spongebob,0
"See ya later, neighbor!",not spongebob,0
It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick.  Okay…Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?",spongebob,1
"Did you find him, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.,spongebob,1
Or maybe he's on a secret mission.,not spongebob,0
I hope he's not in danger.,spongebob,1
Danger?!,not spongebob,0
"As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.",spongebob,1
Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?,not spongebob,0
"Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.",spongebob,1
At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to.  What are you two doing in my house?,not spongebob,0
We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.,spongebob,1
I say he checks out a-ok.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips?",spongebob,1
"French tips, huh?  Alright, pal, make with the relaxing foot massage, pronto!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, you two! OUT!!!  And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day! Or tomorrow! Or next week!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, does that include…",spongebob,1
"YES, IT DOES!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?",spongebob,1
"YES, I WAS! You call yourselves good neighbors? YOU'RE THE WORST NEIGHBORS EVER!  You don't deserve to wear those fezzes!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.",not spongebob,0
"NO, YOU AREN'T!!! YOU'RE HORRIBLE NEIGHBORS!!!  AND STOP CALLING ME PRESIDENT!!!",not spongebob,0
"C'mon, let's go.",spongebob,1
There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper.,not spongebob,0
Good neighbors my right.  Hello? Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation,not spongebob,0
System Activated.,not spongebob,0
That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.,not spongebob,0
President Squidward?,spongebob,1
What the…?!,not spongebob,0
We hereby present you with this delicious cake.,spongebob,1
"Sorry for bugging you so much? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!",not spongebob,0
No threat detected.,not spongebob,0
Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!,not spongebob,0
Threat detected.,not spongebob,0
What's going on?,not spongebob,0
Threat detected. Code red. Code red!,not spongebob,0
It's like a carnival ride!,spongebob,1
"Run for your lives!  What the-? What are you doing?!  I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me.",not spongebob,0
Fire!,not spongebob,0
Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.,not spongebob,0
"We gotta turn this thing off.  Nope, not it.",spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Nope.,spongebob,1
"That's not it, either.",not spongebob,0
This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot.,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No-no, don't say anything. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Mr. President-,spongebob,1
Shush.,not spongebob,0
But we just wanted to…,spongebob,1
Get out of my house! Huh?,not spongebob,0
There he is!,not spongebob,0
Are you the owner of this house?,not spongebob,0
"Yes! Yes, I am!",not spongebob,0
"Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom,  I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!",spongebob,1
Ha!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Krabs!,not spongebob,0
I'll take that.,not spongebob,0
How'd you know it was me?,not spongebob,0
"Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.",not spongebob,0
Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.,not spongebob,0
You think? SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Wooo-ooo!,spongebob,1
"3, 2, 1…, launch!",not spongebob,0
AAHH!,not spongebob,0
Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I resent that! Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it.",not spongebob,0
"Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies!",not spongebob,0
"I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!  Oh, aren't you just too cute.  Coochie coochie coo!",spongebob,1
"Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure thing, Plankton.  Here you go, little guy.",spongebob,1
"Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!  Hello.",not spongebob,0
Police! Police!,spongebob,1
"Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  That was easy. I'm free! Free!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby!  It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula!  What do we do, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break.",not spongebob,0
…and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.,not spongebob,0
"Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time, spray SpongeBob, too.",not spongebob,0
Not sure I follow you.,not spongebob,0
Listen carefully. Spray...,not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
...Sponge....,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
....Bob.....,not spongebob,0
Right.,not spongebob,0
....Too!,not spongebob,0
Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
That's just what I…,not spongebob,0
"I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s?",spongebob,1
Hands in the air!,not spongebob,0
Plankton!,spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal?  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote!  One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult?  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!",not spongebob,0
Ahem!,not spongebob,0
"Krabs! Nice diaper.  Hold on, hold on! I think I...  Yes, I've got it!",not spongebob,0
Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!,not spongebob,0
Peek-a-boo!,not spongebob,0
I can't tolerate your stinky gas!,not spongebob,0
That makes two of us.,not spongebob,0
I don't do it on purpose!,not spongebob,0
"You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…a nother penny! Come to papa! Now, what were we doing?",not spongebob,0
"This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!",not spongebob,0
"Eh? What was that, sonny?",not spongebob,0
"Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless.",not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!",spongebob,1
I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again!,not spongebob,0
I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.,spongebob,1
This baby gas is worthless!  At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
"What was that, sonny?",spongebob,1
It'll take more time to explain than you have left.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!,not spongebob,0
Catch who?,spongebob,1
"Oh, Gesundheit.",not spongebob,0
Victory is mine!,not spongebob,0
"Come back here, you little whippersnapper!",spongebob,1
"You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!",not spongebob,0
I'm catching up with my knitting.,spongebob,1
"That's it! Knit, little nitwit!",not spongebob,0
That was almost too easy.  What? No! I demand you geezers release me!,not spongebob,0
Right after the party. The piñata party.,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
That's for calling us old.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, quit it!",not spongebob,0
I want candy!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?",not spongebob,0
You mean the Kelp-O?,not spongebob,0
"No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.",not spongebob,0
Are you talking about my baby? creep!,not spongebob,0
"Ow, ow, ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow, ow, ow, ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!",not spongebob,0
Just like all your other plans that couldn't possibly fail?,not spongebob,0
"What is it now, Karen?",not spongebob,0
I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!,not spongebob,0
That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig!,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, don't you dare!",not spongebob,0
Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!,not spongebob,0
"Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch!",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, little feller?",spongebob,1
That was loud.,not spongebob,0
"All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon.  SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.  Bubble wand.  Mesh tank top.  And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.,spongebob,1
"Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Oh.  Pom-poms,  megaphone, and spirit!",not spongebob,0
Uh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader?,not spongebob,0
Yes I do!,not spongebob,0
"Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon!",not spongebob,0
Eww!,not spongebob,0
Huh?  Mm!,not spongebob,0
"No, that moon.",not spongebob,0
Ohh!,not spongebob,0
"Squidina, what did you bring?",not spongebob,0
"Eyeglasses,  comic books,  and action figures.",not spongebob,0
"Ugh, can a person be any nerdier?",not spongebob,0
I can.,spongebob,1
Ew!,not spongebob,0
"Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it.",not spongebob,0
Science!,spongebob,1
Everyone on board for lift-off.,not spongebob,0
Ouch!,not spongebob,0
"Let's go, Scout!",not spongebob,0
But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.,spongebob,1
The moon is in perfect position for us to launch.  We gotta leave now!,not spongebob,0
Hello? Delivery.  Did someone order a Krabby Patty?  Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks.  Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all.",not spongebob,0
Safety first.,spongebob,1
"Uh, why you!",spongebob,1
"Uhh, everything okay back there, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Thanks!,spongebob,1
"Three, two, one, launch!  Whoops! Lunch.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying!  Whoop!",spongebob,1
This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G.,not spongebob,0
I've never been so light before.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, I gotta fix that.",not spongebob,0
"Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes.  I don't care. Oh, no! Help me!  Hey! Watch it, you big orca!",not spongebob,0
"You watch it, you big dorka!",not spongebob,0
"There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind!  All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped!  Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief.  All my stress is gone.  All my stress is back!",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh, we've got space junk!  Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now!",not spongebob,0
Home run!,spongebob,1
We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt!,not spongebob,0
"Next up, we got a hot belt!",not spongebob,0
Patty melt.,spongebob,1
"Ow!  Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets!",not spongebob,0
Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face!,not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now.  Let's see where we are.  Craters, craters— Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf.  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here.  How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?",spongebob,1
"I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose.",not spongebob,0
"Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home!  Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here.  Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out.  Maybe this one?",not spongebob,0
Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha?,not spongebob,0
Third time's a charm?,not spongebob,0
One small step for a squirrel...,not spongebob,0
Ooh!  One giant leap for SpongeKind.,spongebob,1
"All right, Science Scouts, everyone's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity.",not spongebob,0
"Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh!",not spongebob,0
"Squidina, you collect moon rocks.",not spongebob,0
"Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks!",not spongebob,0
Grrr-avity!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life.",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm...",spongebob,1
"You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure.  I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains.",spongebob,1
"If you find anything, just toot.  Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts.",not spongebob,0
I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you!,not spongebob,0
No one beats the nerd out of Squidina!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!  Missed me!,not spongebob,0
Science! Yay!,not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all,  SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"This moon is a no SpongeBob zone!  Here, I'm the man on the moon!",not spongebob,0
"Um, did someone say, Man on the Moon?  Hello?  Intelligent life?  How about average smarts?  I'd settle for common sense!  Ooh! Intelligent footprints.  Huh?  Wha-hoo!  I found it! I found it!",spongebob,1
"What'd you find, SpaceBob?",not spongebob,0
Intelligent life.,spongebob,1
"I'm not so sure about that.  If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating",spongebob,1
You're right! It's lunch time.  Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared?,not spongebob,0
You bet! Just call me LunchBob.,spongebob,1
Just press the button labeled lunch!,not spongebob,0
"No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp— Whoa! The dark side of the moon.  SpongeBob? Are you in here?  No SpongeBob.  I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy?",not spongebob,0
"Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is.",spongebob,1
Preparing to launch.,not spongebob,0
"No!  No, not launch! Lunch!",spongebob,1
"Uh, wait, wait—what's going on?",not spongebob,0
How should I know?,not spongebob,0
You guys wait here!  Phew! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, Sandy!  Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses.",spongebob,1
"It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together.  Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides.",not spongebob,0
Water's a little dry today.,not spongebob,0
And that last launch depleted our fuel.,not spongebob,0
Ho-ho-ho.,not spongebob,0
That's weird.,not spongebob,0
I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader!,not spongebob,0
I'm sorry you're a nerd!,not spongebob,0
That came out wrong!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me.  Come on, Sandy, bring it on in.",spongebob,1
"It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth.",not spongebob,0
"But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from... in there.",not spongebob,0
Ho-ho-ho.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Squidward? You're the man on the moon?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?!  Of course. Why not?,not spongebob,0
Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.],not spongebob,0
Ohh!  Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this.,not spongebob,0
"Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes...",spongebob,1
"I know, trouble follows.",not spongebob,0
I was gonna say laughter follows.,spongebob,1
"Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side?",not spongebob,0
The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep.  I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums.  Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again.",not spongebob,0
"Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth?",not spongebob,0
"Good question, Mr. Claus.",spongebob,1
We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel.,not spongebob,0
A controlled explosion might move the moon back.,not spongebob,0
"Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that?",not spongebob,0
Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.,spongebob,1
Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts!,not spongebob,0
"No go, the moon's too heavy.",not spongebob,0
I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas.,not spongebob,0
Perfection!,not spongebob,0
Now we just wait for a gust of wind.,spongebob,1
"Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind.",not spongebob,0
Why don't we just push the moon back?,spongebob,1
You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! Get it? Kraken?,not spongebob,0
"Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, Ho-ho-ho! at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help!",not spongebob,0
"But I'm having such a jolly, holly time!  You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice.",not spongebob,0
Everyone nestled all snug?,not spongebob,0
"We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure.",spongebob,1
"I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace!  First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box.",not spongebob,0
Jack-in-the-box.,spongebob,1
"Oh, oh! Let me try!",spongebob,1
Be careful! Don't overwind it!,not spongebob,0
But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon.,spongebob,1
"You broke it, and it was my last one.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm.  Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you!",spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho-ho!,not spongebob,0
"What happened?  Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad.",spongebob,1
"Oh, excuse me. Sorry.",not spongebob,0
Oh-oh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Oh-oh-oh?,spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho backwards.,not spongebob,0
"Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag?",spongebob,1
"Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Santa, squirt me.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I get it.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa!",spongebob,1
"Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, the rocket burped us back.",not spongebob,0
Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff.",not spongebob,0
"Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics!",not spongebob,0
"Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you.  Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight.",spongebob,1
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot.",spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas.",spongebob,1
Come on!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas!",spongebob,1
Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace!,not spongebob,0
"How about a little more, Plankton, or has this old granny had enough for one night?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that looks simply delightful!",not spongebob,0
You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.,not spongebob,0
Ration?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, chocolate. Open up! (feeds the pudding to Grandma) You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me. (wipes off the pudding) There you are. There you are, darling.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton. You always were my favorite granddaughter!",not spongebob,0
"Five minutes until bedtime, Mr. Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...",not spongebob,0
"Five minutes, Mr. Plank...",not spongebob,0
"I heard you the first time! Now, where were we? (Grandma is asleep) Grandma, don't forget your teeth.",not spongebob,0
(spits out teeth and coughs),not spongebob,0
"Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there. (Grandma is asleep) That's perfect! (puts the teeth in his mouth) Perfect! (laughs evilly) Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say No to a helpless little grandma! (thinking. He is at the Krusty Krab. 'female voice) Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?",not spongebob,0
"Goodness, no! (gives the formula to her) Here you are.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there. (laughs evilly as imagery fades) '(Bubble transition)",not spongebob,0
"La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la! (playing in the bathtub. He shoots a squirt of water with his hands. The squirt of water goes through his holes at the top of his head then lands on the bar of soap) Yay! A direct hit! (uses a bar of soap as a walkie-talkie) Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, prepare to dive! Repeat: prepare to di-- (Plankton, disguised as Grandma knocks on the door. He clears his throat) Hi, lady!",spongebob,1
"(female voice) Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?",not spongebob,0
"Ehh, not really...",spongebob,1
"It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!",not spongebob,0
"(gasps) Quick, come inside! (inside of the pineapple) Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?",spongebob,1
"I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...",not spongebob,0
"I'm so glad you came back... (rubs his finger across Plankton's chin) ...Double-Great Grammyma. (Plankton pushes it away and shudders) You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy. (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) Okay, lean forward. (Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. (Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) How about we look through some old family photo albums? (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. (a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?",spongebob,1
"It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... (shows stacks of photo albums) ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.",spongebob,1
Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. (it is night which turns to morning and rooster crows everyone up. SpongeBob and Plankton are asleep. SpongeBob wakes up and exclaims. He looks happily at Plankton),not spongebob,0
Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?,spongebob,1
"Huh?!? Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! (looks up to see SpongeBob still looking happily at him) Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!",spongebob,1
"Uh, sounds delightful. (takes off glasses. evilly laughs) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. (puts on more lipstick. Bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking down the street)",not spongebob,0
"So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?",spongebob,1
"Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?",not spongebob,0
Hmmmm... (flashback of Plankton),spongebob,1
"I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...",not spongebob,0
"(goes back to the present) No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.",spongebob,1
"Well, uh...",not spongebob,0
"(grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him) Come on, it'll be fun! (Bubble transitions over to the place called Grandma's Tea House. SpongeBob drinks tea) Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?",spongebob,1
"Why, yes! (drinks the tea then spits it out on a coaster) How can you drink this dreck?! (all of the grandmas gasp) Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, More, please. (bubble transitions to other grandmas and SpongeBob knitting)",not spongebob,0
"Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?",spongebob,1
Nope. (he has his arms in a yarn circle),not spongebob,0
Why are you not having fun?,spongebob,1
"Why?! Because I don't knit, you nitwit! (his yarn circle gets pulled and so does he by a grandma)",not spongebob,0
"Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. (Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta masta! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) Grandma, you getting bored?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I could eat a village!",not spongebob,0
Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?,spongebob,1
"(reacts) Would I? (laughs. Then laughs maniacally. He clears his throat) Uh, yeah, I would. (bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking to the front entrance of the Krusty Krab) Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?",spongebob,1
"Antenna... What?! No, I...!",not spongebob,0
"(laughs) Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... (Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ...Squidward!",spongebob,1
AAAH!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!",not spongebob,0
I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.,spongebob,1
Your what?,not spongebob,0
"My great-grammyma! (points to Plankton but he's not there) She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.",not spongebob,0
"Right... (starts dumping the garbage in the trash can) SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. (Plankton is hiding in the trash can. He gets a lot of garbage all over him. He starts coughing. SpongeBob walks over to the trash can)",not spongebob,0
"Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.",spongebob,1
Never mind. Just get me into the kitchen!,not spongebob,0
"(cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) Well, here it is.",spongebob,1
At last!,not spongebob,0
"Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties.",spongebob,1
"Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha... What?",spongebob,1
"Nothing, go ahead! (laughs menacingly. He pulls out a green balloon which is a decoy of him dressed as Grandma. He stretches it then blows it up) Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (the balloon floats away and goes above Plankton who is checking under the dirty plates for the formula. The balloon lands in the drain of the sink)",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... (calls) Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dish-washing while I have the chance. (walks to the sink) The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. (turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! (the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) Oh, I can't bear to look! (starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!",not spongebob,0
"Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?",spongebob,1
"Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.",spongebob,1
Why would he?,not spongebob,0
(carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash) Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I feel better already. (begins snoring)",not spongebob,0
"Sweet dreams, Grammyma. (closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up)",spongebob,1
"Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr. Krabs! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! (Grandma Plankton's teeth fall out) I'm just going to savor this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel truly alive! (Grandma Plankton grabs her teeth)",not spongebob,0
"Plankton! (Plankton gasps. Grandma Plankton takes her glasses off his face) You've been a very naughty boy, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"B-But-But-But I... (Grandma Plankton takes her wig off his head) Grandma, I can... (Grandma Plankton takes her dress off Plankton's body)",not spongebob,0
I've been looking all over for this stuff!,not spongebob,0
"Grandma, I can explain!",not spongebob,0
"(grabs Plankton by his right antenna and drags him out of the kitchen) I'm sure you can. Plankton Jr., you know you always were a... (stops at one of SpongeBob's feet)",not spongebob,0
"Grandma? (gasps) You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?",spongebob,1
"Get out of my way, rapscallion! (SpongeBob does so) I've had enough foolishness for one day. (Plankton groans. Grandma Plankton drags him out of the Krusty Krab. The episode ends)",not spongebob,0
"There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Grandma!",spongebob,1
"Come in and sit for a while.  Have a cookie, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies...",spongebob,1
"Now, who wants to lick the spoon?",not spongebob,0
"Me, me, me!",spongebob,1
...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.,not spongebob,0
Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!,spongebob,1
"Hop in my car, I'll drop you off.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Grandma!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy!",not spongebob,0
"I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.",spongebob,1
"I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.",not spongebob,0
Did I do something funny?,spongebob,1
Your forehead.,not spongebob,0
My forehead is funny?,spongebob,1
"Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy!",not spongebob,0
"No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.",spongebob,1
"No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers!  And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um...  ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and...",not spongebob,0
All right already!,not spongebob,0
"Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.",not spongebob,0
"Really? You do, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, your grandma!",not spongebob,0
HaHaHaHaHaHa!!!,not spongebob,0
STOOOOOP IIIIIIIIT!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time!,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Me, too.",spongebob,1
You're the most adult person I know.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.",spongebob,1
"Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say, tax exemption!",not spongebob,0
Tax exemption!,spongebob,1
"Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  ...Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you gonna tell Grandma?",not spongebob,0
I'm a grown up!,spongebob,1
"No ifs, ands, or buts about it!",not spongebob,0
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!,spongebob,1
And then you get behind her and I'll push!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we didn't say that!!!",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah, right.",not spongebob,0
All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years...!,spongebob,1
Sideburns!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.",spongebob,1
"Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.",not spongebob,0
"He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you are absolutely right.",not spongebob,0
"I am? I mean, of course I am.",spongebob,1
You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.,not spongebob,0
"I am glad you see it my way, grandmother.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm glad that's settled.  But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick?",spongebob,1
"Keep 'em coming, Granny!",not spongebob,0
So much for no more baby stuff.,spongebob,1
And don't forget the cookie-eating hat!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.",spongebob,1
"Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.",not spongebob,0
"Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?!  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults!",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy.  Who's the baby?",not spongebob,0
"I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.",not spongebob,0
Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup.,spongebob,1
Here's a fresh batch of cookies.,not spongebob,0
"All right!  Rewards, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz...",spongebob,1
"Oh, Grandma, I'm full.",not spongebob,0
More cookies!,not spongebob,0
It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do.,spongebob,1
"Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral?",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious.",spongebob,1
Storytime!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!",not spongebob,0
Storytime?,spongebob,1
"You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun.  Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book.  Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it.",spongebob,1
D'oh! My wittle finger!,not spongebob,0
"Hold still, hold still.  All better?",not spongebob,0
Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too.,not spongebob,0
How about I give you a present?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  ALRIGHT! Another hat!",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, it's a sweater.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
With love in every stitch.,not spongebob,0
"No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I almost forgot.  Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind.  Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.",spongebob,1
"Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, that is it. Here I go.",spongebob,1
Come again if you get the chance.,not spongebob,0
"Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.",spongebob,1
Toodleloo.,not spongebob,0
I don't know when I'll be back.,spongebob,1
I know how busy you are.,not spongebob,0
"So, uh... that's it.",spongebob,1
"Shh, he's asleep.",not spongebob,0
Soooo loooong...  I DON'T WANNA GROW UP!  I want cookies!  and milkie!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear diadies!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo!,spongebob,1
"Take it easy, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!  You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.",not spongebob,0
I don't?,spongebob,1
"Of course not.  No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo.  And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult.  Here you go.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
No problem.,not spongebob,0
Wah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic.",not spongebob,0
"It's all about you today, Karen.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this makes up of a lot of your stupidity lately, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton's stepped away for a moment. The name's Ray Ray, and I am at your service, m'lady.  Pow!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, kiss me, pipsqueak. I mean, Ray Ray.",not spongebob,0
Grandma?! I told you never to call me on this screen.,not spongebob,0
"Sheldon,  is that you?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, it's me, Grandma. Always nice to hear from you. Okay, gotta go.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, sweetie. See you tomorrow at 8 AM sharp.",not spongebob,0
"Right, see you then. Wait a minute, what? 8 AM? Um, what's happening at 8 AM, Grandma?",not spongebob,0
"Don't you remember, silly?  You promised me you'd own  the Krusty Krab by my 90th birthday. Well, my 90th is tomorrow! You do own the Krusty Krab now, right?",not spongebob,0
"Lie, that's it!  Uh, you're darn right I own the Krusty Krab, Grandma, and I can't wait to give you the grand tour, uh, tomorrow morning.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, see you then.",not spongebob,0
That smack was for Plankton.  Now bring back Ray Ray.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what am I gonna do, Karen? How am I gonna fool Grandma tomorrow?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay, I guess bath time is over.  Why don't you and Ray Ray take a long walk off a short plank?",not spongebob,0
"Gotta think, gotta think.  Come on, brain!",not spongebob,0
"This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty!  Whoo!  Whoop, whoop.  Ooh.  Aah.  Whew. ' Ow!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBoob, you gotta help me.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?",spongebob,1
"This is not an evil scheme.  The truth is I promised my grandma I would own the Krusty Krab by her 90th birthday. So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it.",spongebob,1
I'm not gonna buy what?,not spongebob,0
One Pathetic Sob-Story Later...,not spongebob,0
I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.,not spongebob,0
"I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye.",not spongebob,0
"That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth.",spongebob,1
"You know,  I have a grandma too.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"All right, I buy it.",not spongebob,0
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"First things first.  That should keep it safe for six to eight hours.  All right, me pretties, let's make this place pro-Plankton pronto!",not spongebob,0
"Now everyone remember, for the rest of the day, Plankton is the—  Plankton's boss.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Grandma. Happy birthday.",not spongebob,0
"Nice to see you again, Grandma Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Ugh. Who invited C-Pee-Eww?,not spongebob,0
"All right, I tried.",not spongebob,0
"Owuh!  Let me help you with your bag, Grandma.  Ouch!",not spongebob,0
"Well, here we are, Grandma. Welcome to the Krusty Plankton. I named it after you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, aren't you a sweet grandson?  Who are they?",not spongebob,0
"They're just my employees, Grandma. Meet SpongeBob and Eugene.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Grandma Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"They look like very nice boys, and I'll bet they're even nicer when they're working.",not spongebob,0
"You heard, Grandma! We ain't running a welcome wagon here! Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure thing, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"That's Mr. Plankton to you, busboy.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Plankton. It won't happen again.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, look, that one's napping on the job.",not spongebob,0
"Nap time's over, loafer!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, who's the wise guy?",not spongebob,0
"Ohh.  Oh, my goodness! Who is this handsome young man?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's Squidward. He's nobody. Moving along...",not spongebob,0
Mm. Squidward. Didn't we meet at an early bird dinner?,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer!  Ow!",spongebob,1
"All right, lady, I don't normally say this,  but get off my nose.",not spongebob,0
"Go along with it, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Or you're fired.,not spongebob,0
"So, Grandma Plankton, where have you been all my life?",not spongebob,0
Call me Lily.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Grandma, you're embarrassing me now.",not spongebob,0
"To the kitchen, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Try one of our Planky Patties, Grandma. Fresh off the grill.",not spongebob,0
"I'll need my teeth for this.  Whoops.  Oops. I dropped my choppers. Oh, well. I guess Squidward will have to chew it for me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure, I'll—what?!  Aah.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, chew it up real good. That's enough. My turn.",not spongebob,0
Aah.,not spongebob,0
Aah.  Delicious.,not spongebob,0
Ew!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Sheldon, you've outdone yourself. You really are a master chef.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Sheldon.  You've really made my birthday something extra special this year.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Grandma.  Got your bag? You are out the door and that is that.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, just one more thing.",not spongebob,0
My last birthday wish is to get a photo of me posing with the Krabby Patty secret formula.,not spongebob,0
Krabs?,not spongebob,0
Fine. Anything to get that bag with the bag out of here.,not spongebob,0
Say cheese.,not spongebob,0
Cheese.,not spongebob,0
Ahhh!,not spongebob,0
"Finally, the secret formula is mine!",not spongebob,0
"I knew your sincerity was insincere, sir!",not spongebob,0
"I didn't know anything about this, Eugene, honest! But I love it! Now we can rule the world as a family, eh, Grandma?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Sheldon, but I'm not sharing the formula with you!",not spongebob,0
But Grandma!,not spongebob,0
"Adios, mi amour! Mmmm.",not spongebob,0
Why? Why did I lie?,not spongebob,0
Why? Why did I pretend?,spongebob,1
Why?  Why did I give her my formula?,not spongebob,0
Why? Why wouldn't we be open on Tuesday? Idiot!,not spongebob,0
What have we done?,not spongebob,0
I have the secret formula!  This world is mine!,not spongebob,0
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!,not spongebob,0
"Darling,  why don't you toss the peasants a little something?",not spongebob,0
My leg!,not spongebob,0
"I'll take that, thank you very much.  Safe and sound.",not spongebob,0
"Happy birthday, Grandma.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.",not spongebob,0
Sorry. No check. But I've got this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!",not spongebob,0
"I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws. And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.",not spongebob,0
"One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.",not spongebob,0
"So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....",not spongebob,0
Aaarrrrr!,not spongebob,0
"And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.",not spongebob,0
I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.,not spongebob,0
"Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson.",not spongebob,0
"Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...",not spongebob,0
Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, uh, Grandpa...",not spongebob,0
"And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress. Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.",not spongebob,0
"For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.,spongebob,1
"Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.",not spongebob,0
We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate.",not spongebob,0
Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!,spongebob,1
"But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!",not spongebob,0
"Way to go, fellars.",not spongebob,0
Hee-ar!,not spongebob,0
He's comin'!,not spongebob,0
"Har, har, har!",not spongebob,0
"Hide me, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Eugene, me boy! Aye, it's good to see you and yer ship after so many moons! Just beginin' to think you was lyin' to yer old granddad!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?",not spongebob,0
Hm...this might be a pirate crew. But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers.,not spongebob,0
Um...,spongebob,1
"Har, har, har! I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy! You look like a fine pirate crew.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Now, let's see what this rusty old pelican can do! Let's sail!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.",spongebob,1
"Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.",not spongebob,0
Aye.,not spongebob,0
"I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!",not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
"There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.",not spongebob,0
What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack!",not spongebob,0
Grrrrrr....,not spongebob,0
"Aye, look at the size of that beast.",not spongebob,0
"Not to worry, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
Aha! That's the stuff!,not spongebob,0
"Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?",not spongebob,0
Whah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing. Look!",not spongebob,0
"Har, har, har, har! That's me boy!",not spongebob,0
Clear!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Woo-hoo!,spongebob,1
"Sounds like we got a prize.  Ready, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad. Check the... Granddad?",not spongebob,0
Ahoy! Trouble aproachin' quick! Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow! Man your battle stations!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.",not spongebob,0
"What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?! Move!",not spongebob,0
"What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?",not spongebob,0
Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen! A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, so depulsive.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. It must be destroyed! Here, see for yourself.",not spongebob,0
"Go get it, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!,not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel?",not spongebob,0
Dad!,not spongebob,0
"That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!",not spongebob,0
Open up!,not spongebob,0
"Prepare to meet yer maker, sea witch.",not spongebob,0
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
What are ya doin'?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded.",not spongebob,0
What is this?!,not spongebob,0
I can explain.,not spongebob,0
Dad! Dad!,not spongebob,0
Now it's even more angry!,not spongebob,0
Don't worry! I have it under control!,not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!,not spongebob,0
What's with the lame outfit?,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, never mind that!  Just go home.",not spongebob,0
I bet you're wondering about that.,not spongebob,0
"Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!",not spongebob,0
Do you mind?,not spongebob,0
What kinda ship are you runnin' here?,not spongebob,0
Just a second.,not spongebob,0
Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!,not spongebob,0
"Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.",not spongebob,0
"I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stickier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?",not spongebob,0
"Of course I do, Granddad.",not spongebob,0
"Well, then, say it!",not spongebob,0
"It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!  And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie!  This crew is a lie!  Even the ship is a lie!  All of it! All a lie!",not spongebob,0
Krabby Patties: $2.00. Krusty Combo: $3.99! Coral Bits: $1.95?!,not spongebob,0
"You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.",not spongebob,0
"Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's real piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!",not spongebob,0

"Well, fine, if you don't want my money!",not spongebob,0
"Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?",not spongebob,0

No.,not spongebob,0
Good! 'Cause we've got customers!,spongebob,1

Don't hold back.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!",spongebob,1

But I thought you liked the night shift.,not spongebob,0
You're right!  FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB!  AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh!  Piece of cake.,spongebob,1
So you're not afraid?,not spongebob,0
"Pfft, nah.",spongebob,1
"Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know.",not spongebob,0
What? What do I know?,spongebob,1
You don't remember? It was all over the news.,not spongebob,0
"Tell me, tell me!",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you.",not spongebob,0
"What happened, what happened, what happened!?",spongebob,1
You mean you've never heard the story of the  Hash-Slinging Slasher?,not spongebob,0
The Slash-Bringing Hasher?,spongebob,1
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!,not spongebob,0
"The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging,  The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.",spongebob,1
"Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha--- because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!",not spongebob,0
Tell me the story!,spongebob,1
"Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.",not spongebob,0
He forgot the secret sauce?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
He didn't wash his hands?,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Irregular portions?,spongebob,1
No!! He cut off his own hand by mistake!,not spongebob,0
"You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or...",spongebob,1
Except he wasn't a sponge.,not spongebob,0
So?,spongebob,1
So it didn't grow back!,not spongebob,0
"OH, NO!!!",spongebob,1
"And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?",not spongebob,0
Tuesday.,spongebob,1
"Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.",not spongebob,0
But tonight's Tuesday night!,spongebob,1
Then he'll be coming.,not spongebob,0
How will we know?,spongebob,1
There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First: the lights will flicker on and off. Next...,not spongebob,0
"Dude, can I have some ketchup?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, here you go.  Next: the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally: the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...",not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
He opens the door...  ...he slowly approaches the counter!  And you know what he does next?,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You really want to know?,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Are you sure you want to know?,not spongebob,0
"WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!",spongebob,1
"He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SPONGEBOB, I WAS JOKING!!",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
It's not true! None of it's true!,not spongebob,0
It's not?,spongebob,1
Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.,not spongebob,0
Ohhhhh...,spongebob,1
"Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.",spongebob,1
Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Three A.M.!",not spongebob,0
"Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
"And the lights will flicker on and off, just like the story. I get it.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?",spongebob,1
"I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Nice try, what?",not spongebob,0
"The phone will ring and there will be no one there.  Oh, you crack me up.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  ...and the walls will ooze green slime?!?!  Oh, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?",not spongebob,0
I didn't know the buses ran this late.,spongebob,1
They don't!,not spongebob,0
"Well, they're dropping someone off.",spongebob,1
"The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...",not spongebob,0
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!,spongebob,1
At last you understand! We're doomed!,not spongebob,0
"No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One: I hate you. And two: how can that be me when I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!?",not spongebob,0
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!!!!,not spongebob,0
He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!,spongebob,1
"Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula.  I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.",not spongebob,0
Do you have references?,spongebob,1
"Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?",not spongebob,0
Nosferatu!,not spongebob,0
"♪Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--♪  Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'.  Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me!",not spongebob,0
"That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.",not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
"That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!",not spongebob,0
Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?,not spongebob,0
What's happening to me?!,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I could—",not spongebob,0
I  need  food.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--",not spongebob,0
...refrigerator.,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.",not spongebob,0
So did I.,not spongebob,0
"You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.",not spongebob,0
It means I need food!,not spongebob,0
Empty!,not spongebob,0

"Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you're just gonna have to go buy some.",not spongebob,0
"Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, what's that green stuff in your pocket?",not spongebob,0
Eh? Where?,not spongebob,0
There!,not spongebob,0
Me money?,not spongebob,0
I'll just have to eat this.,not spongebob,0
"No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh?",not spongebob,0
Must protect garden.  Only thing that makes life worth living.,not spongebob,0
"Hehehehehe! Peanuts!  What the...  These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables!",not spongebob,0
"Who's there? I'm warning you. I have a blunt instrument here, and I'm not afraid to use it.  There you are, sucker!",not spongebob,0
"Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff!  Jackpot.  Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl.  Don't worry, Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles!  Bottom feeders.  Pearl! I brought you some--  ...cereal.",not spongebob,0
"More, Daddy, More!",not spongebob,0
"There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again!",not spongebob,0
"Which way did you say the kidnapper ran, Miss, uh, Mrs., uh, Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mrs.  So which way did you say he went?",not spongebob,0
I said he went that way.,not spongebob,0
Anything else?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Got it. Johnson.  Well, looks like whoever it was is gone now, ma'am. Enjoy the rest of the evening.  I tell ya, these calls are getting more and more weird. I mean, what kind of nutcase would want to break into someone's vegetable garden at this time of night?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I doubt he's gonna turn up anywhere near here again tonight. What do you say we go check out that new 24-hour taser emporium you were talking about?",not spongebob,0
"Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!  Food.  Not food.  Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge.  Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. I needed to lose a little weight anyway.",not spongebob,0
"And that's what I told him. I said, If you're not gonna bring an extra set of batteries, then why even carry a--  Hey mister! What's with the sack?",not spongebob,0
S-sack?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sack. That big giant sack thing you're carrying on your back, that sack.",not spongebob,0
"It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be Santy Claws for the holidays.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you have a safe night now.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks again, officer!",not spongebob,0
Be seeing you in a couple months.  Happy Holidays.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya!",not spongebob,0
More!,not spongebob,0
I was afraid you were gonna say that.,not spongebob,0
I wasn't stealing food!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See",not spongebob,0
"Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.",spongebob,1
"G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.",not spongebob,0
"Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.",not spongebob,0
But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.,spongebob,1
I don't care. I'm calling the police.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait, you can't.",not spongebob,0
Oh? And why is that?,not spongebob,0
"Because if you do, I'll fire ya.  No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Hello, police?",not spongebob,0
Hold it! I'll... I'll...,not spongebob,0
You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?,not spongebob,0
I didn't even know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.,spongebob,1
Neither did I.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.",spongebob,1
"It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
Pearl? What happened?,spongebob,1
"She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?",spongebob,1
"Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.",not spongebob,0
You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.,spongebob,1
"Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, hurry it up!",not spongebob,0
"Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.",spongebob,1
You've been saying that for the last--,not spongebob,0
"Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!",not spongebob,0
"Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?",not spongebob,0
"It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.",spongebob,1
Eh?,not spongebob,0
"Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?",spongebob,1
Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.,not spongebob,0
You have a secret?,spongebob,1
"Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles.",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir. And who will be in charge while you're gone.",spongebob,1
"Eh,  well, not Squidward.  No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.,not spongebob,0
I'm... in charge?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir.",spongebob,1
What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes,not spongebob,0
"Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?",spongebob,1
Krabs is gone?,not spongebob,0
Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.,spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge.  Charge. Charge.",spongebob,1
Wake me up when I care.,not spongebob,0
Do you care now?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's just that I'm in charge and...",spongebob,1
And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?,not spongebob,0
Regulary scheduled nap?,spongebob,1
This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.,not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I, um...",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"Order up, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties.",spongebob,1
So do it when you're done.,not spongebob,0
And unclog the sink.,spongebob,1
Would you like to hear a secret?,not spongebob,0
What kind of secret?,spongebob,1
See that guy over there?,not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!",not spongebob,0
Me?,spongebob,1

Lookin' good!,not spongebob,0
"You mean, lookin' bad! Enjoy our fine decor!",spongebob,1

"You can't make this easy, can you?",not spongebob,0
"Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
Give me a break.,not spongebob,0
"And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.

What crime?  I'm a bad person!,not spongebob,0
"Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! City paralyzed with fear!   Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge.   Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!",not spongebob,0
"Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?. Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?",spongebob,1
I wanna be good!,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?",spongebob,1
Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, now what?",spongebob,1
Hmmm...,not spongebob,0

"Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark.",not spongebob,0
Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.,spongebob,1
Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.   Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!,not spongebob,0
"Where is he, Patrick?",spongebob,1
At the intersection of Conch and Coral.,not spongebob,0
"That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?",spongebob,1
"Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly!  Get out of there, SpongeBob!  That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack!  He's acting all crazy! Run! Hind behind that building!  No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign!  No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light!  No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life!",not spongebob,0
"Say again, deputy?",spongebob,1
The maniac's in the mailbox!,not spongebob,0

We'll take that as a confession.,not spongebob,0

You know this guy?,not spongebob,0

"Oh, why do I try to compete with Krabs? He always goes long and I always fall short! Will I ever get the upper hand?",not spongebob,0
"That's it! My glove! My big, beautiful, bone-crushing glove! Thank you, clam!",not spongebob,0
The pinky is wiggling... wiggling!  Let's see Krabs throw down this gauntlet!  Hi-ya!,not spongebob,0
"I want a rematch, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Boring.  But whatevs.,not spongebob,0
"Oh no, not a hand cramp! Not now!  Luckily I have a last-minute substitution, standing by.",not spongebob,0
"Eeeh – oh, oh – oh —  Any... last... words?",not spongebob,0
Just one... Sucker!,not spongebob,0
"Huh –?  No, no, no, no, no, no —",not spongebob,0
"Ta-daah! Let's give a big hand to the new champion!  Okay, move it, filthy fingers!  Aww, too bad Krabs isn't here to catch me with my glove in the cookie jar, heheh... Bust the door!  Bust this one, too!  And now, for the secret formula! Open, said me!  Go and hand me that, I command you!  Please don't hurt me!  Whew!",not spongebob,0
Look out!,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh. That glove is gonna destroy Bikini Bottom and I'm gonna get blamed for it!  I hate prison food! But I can't stop that monster all by myself... This is an emergency!  Emergency box... That's convenient!,not spongebob,0
"What is your emergency, Sir?  Oh, hi, Plankton.",spongebob,1
"I need a hand with something, kid.  Now do it!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Sir... No matter what the emergency, I've seen it all before.",spongebob,1
I've never seen that before!,spongebob,1
Usually it's sitting quietly on top of the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe we can talk to it.",spongebob,1
Talk is cheap!  Which leads you to push this button when I say so.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Fistface! Prepare for annihilation!  Push the button, SpongeBob!  Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can't do it, I can't shoot the glove!  It's – it's wiggling...",spongebob,1
I must push it!  What?  Why are you here again?,not spongebob,0
"I'm helping.  Listen to me, Plankton. You can't fight a big monster like that with hate. You can only defeat them with love.",spongebob,1
Love? That's too brutal... Let's do it!,not spongebob,0
"Daddy, I want it!",not spongebob,0
"Now, Timmy, you already have one of those glove toys at home.",not spongebob,0
Not that one...  That one!,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Glove-zilla!  Someone needs to teach you some Swedish manners!",not spongebob,0
"Sick 'em, Hans!",not spongebob,0
I challenge you to a duel!,not spongebob,0
"Give him the old butt-kicking discount, Hans!",not spongebob,0
But only love will defeat the glove!,spongebob,1
"Oh, look, they're playing rock-paper-scissors!  One, two, three!",spongebob,1
Yeah! Nothing beats scissors...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, except rock...",spongebob,1
"Oh my goodness, it's a thumb war!",spongebob,1
"I can't defeat the glove, SpongeBob, it's too strong! You need to create a diversion.",not spongebob,0
"Diversion, eh?",spongebob,1
Oh... Aha!  No...,not spongebob,0
"We need a bullhorn, stat!",not spongebob,0
"I am a bullhorn, stat!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Figure-face! Your grandma is a combat boot!",not spongebob,0
I got him!  How do I look?,not spongebob,0
"Aww, they fit each other just like a glove.",spongebob,1
Hardy-har-har.,not spongebob,0
"He's harmless now, SpongeBob. See you tomorrow morning, I'll bring the pants!",not spongebob,0
"Wha–? Hey, come back! That glove is irreplaceable! Or is it?",not spongebob,0
That looks way better than a glove! And it's a combat boot... to boot.  Ouch!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.,spongebob,1
How is Gary?,not spongebob,0
"He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh...  Who was I talking to?",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. Dear Sir or Ma'am...  We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience.  Hello?  My package. Whoopee!  Oh, let's see what we got here.  My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row. Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Darn it.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
What was that?,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Darn it.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, is that you?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, darn it. Darn it.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Darn it. Darn it.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Darn it.,spongebob,1
Snap out of it.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I...",spongebob,1
"What is it, buddy? You can tell me.",not spongebob,0
I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.,spongebob,1
You what?!,not spongebob,0
"Why are you crying, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
What happened?,spongebob,1
I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.,not spongebob,0
"You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?",spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?,spongebob,1
About a week.,not spongebob,0
A week? Are you sure?,spongebob,1
"Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.",not spongebob,0
Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
I can't find Gary.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.,spongebob,1
Eight?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new...",spongebob,1
I only tasted six types of sediment.,not spongebob,0
"Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Gary!,spongebob,1
What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?,not spongebob,0
"You check over there. I'll check in here.  Find him yet, Pat?",spongebob,1
"No, but I'll keep looking.",not spongebob,0
But there's nowhere left to look.,spongebob,1
There's one place we haven't checked.,not spongebob,0
I doubt Gary could fit in there.,spongebob,1
Can't hurt to look.,not spongebob,0
"Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Let's see. Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me. Dear Neptune, what have I done?",spongebob,1
What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.,not spongebob,0
Gary.,spongebob,1
"Are my pants too tight, dear?",not spongebob,0
Look who came to dinner.,not spongebob,0
Guess he didn't like nachos.,not spongebob,0
"There you are.  There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm.  You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers.  There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.",not spongebob,0
Mmm.,not spongebob,0
"Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again.  There you go.  After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised.  Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system.  Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter.  You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie.  Oh.  Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.",not spongebob,0
Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary!,spongebob,1
"Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time.  It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy?",not spongebob,0
"Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh,  I almost forgot your good night kiss.  Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...",spongebob,1
Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out.,not spongebob,0
Gary.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Refund?! What's wrong with it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears!",not spongebob,0
What the...?,not spongebob,0
Gary...,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!",not spongebob,0
This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.,spongebob,1
"Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you see...",spongebob,1
"That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
That's me boy!,not spongebob,0
"If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.",spongebob,1
Wh...?,not spongebob,0
It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.",spongebob,1
But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do.",spongebob,1
"There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"How about a little more syrup on those pancakes?  Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo!  Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy.  Oh, here we are.",not spongebob,0
"Here's a good spot.  Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob. Quick, hand me the tape.",spongebob,1
"Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is no time for that.",spongebob,1
"Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.",not spongebob,0
These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.,not spongebob,0
"Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.",not spongebob,0
"Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.",not spongebob,0
There.,spongebob,1
"When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half] Um...uhh...",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out.",spongebob,1
"Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.",not spongebob,0
"Gary, come home!♪",not spongebob,0
I want peanuts.,not spongebob,0
"Pat, no!",spongebob,1
Who is this 'Lisa' person?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy.",not spongebob,0
"Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go!",spongebob,1
"You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done.  Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies.",not spongebob,0
Run!,not spongebob,0
"You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too.  Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love.  Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.",not spongebob,0
Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.,not spongebob,0
"Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.",not spongebob,0
Who?,not spongebob,0
You must be starving.,not spongebob,0
"Just let it out, buddy. That's right.",not spongebob,0
"I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.",spongebob,1
"Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood!  They were awesome!",not spongebob,0
"Gary loved balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary!  So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Maybe I'll...practice my clarinet.,not spongebob,0
Ah-he-he-hem.,not spongebob,0
"Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ...would want.",spongebob,1
"Hi, neighbor!",spongebob,1
Gah! Dah! Dah! Dah!,not spongebob,0

"Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no. Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again!

"Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squilliam, but we've gotta get back to the show.",not spongebob,0

Really?,not spongebob,0
Really!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, we'll be at your house in two hours with a camera crew.",not spongebob,0
"Two hours? But I haven't even had time to wash my hair.  There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just...  There's a hideous hole in the wall!

Umm... What day is it today?,spongebob,1
It's the day you go away and never come back.,not spongebob,0

How did you know about that?,not spongebob,0
I was spying on you.,spongebob,1
"Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because...  All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo?",not spongebob,0

"All right. First, I'm going to give you something so simple, a person without a brain could even get it done right.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo, that's good, 'cause I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it.",spongebob,1
I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded part on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!,not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what was that noise?  Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room?! I told you just to paint the faded spot.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it all looked kinda faded.",spongebob,1
"Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?",spongebob,1
"Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it till I say...  Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't...  Ow!",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say...  Ow! Why do you keep moving it?",not spongebob,0
‘Cause you keep saying “ow”!,spongebob,1
"I don't need you, I can move it myself.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!",not spongebob,0
"Roger!  Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power.",spongebob,1

"Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off.",spongebob,1
"Come out of there.  Uh, hang on, please.  Please, just one more minute, Nick!",not spongebob,0

"Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery!  Have mercy on my soul...!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it, uh... here.  See ya!",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look.  Well, I, I, I... I'm not quite sure how to say this...",not spongebob,0

"Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
I have-... I have?,not spongebob,0

"Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help you redecorate. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning to you, too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get...",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Ah! Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me?  Ah! Today is Sunday?! But that means...",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today.  The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays.  Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have?  Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!",spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob. I know it's last minute, but...",not spongebob,0
I would love to.,spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation.  SpongeBob, are you getting all this?",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
Here's a comprehensive list of dos and don'ts to follow.,not spongebob,0
"Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.",spongebob,1
That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope.,not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
"Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...",not spongebob,0
Wow...!,spongebob,1
...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal.,not spongebob,0
Nor... mal. Got it.,spongebob,1
And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.,not spongebob,0
That stands to reason.,spongebob,1
"This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing.  You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I respect your meticulous nature.,spongebob,1
"Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
What's next on the list?,spongebob,1
"This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway.  And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.",spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
Yep.,spongebob,1
Are you really sure?,not spongebob,0
Really sure.,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Normal.  2,692...  2,693...  2,694...  Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute.  Aha!  There... we go.  Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here.  What the...?  Ohhh! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for...  ...weeks! What is going on?!  Oh! Patrick?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! There you are!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.",spongebob,1
"Nah, no thanks. I had a late breakfast.",not spongebob,0
Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?,spongebob,1
"Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for...  P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe!",spongebob,1
There you go.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick,  I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.",spongebob,1
E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!,not spongebob,0
That's right. Exit the tree...,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we go—Jellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?",not spongebob,0
"Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.",spongebob,1
"All right, let's go!",not spongebob,0
"Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.",spongebob,1
"Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.",not spongebob,0
Nnnnope.,spongebob,1
Pleeease?,not spongebob,0
Not gonna happen.,spongebob,1
Pretty please?,not spongebob,0
No way.,spongebob,1
Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, right.",spongebob,1
"Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what do you take me for?",spongebob,1
And a scoop of nuts!,not spongebob,0
Deal.,spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
But you have to promise not to touch anything.,spongebob,1
"I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.",not spongebob,0
"Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex...  Patrick!   Patrick, no! You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything!",spongebob,1
I wasn't touching anything!,not spongebob,0
Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!,spongebob,1
Um... Tasting it.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear?  Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick?",spongebob,1
Is this close enough?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do.",spongebob,1
Not... touch anything.,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm. What else?,spongebob,1
Not do anything.,not spongebob,0
And...?,spongebob,1
Not... look at anything.,not spongebob,0
Until when? Until...?,spongebob,1
Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting.,not spongebob,0
"Good boy, Patrick!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Uh, can I... can I... can I... can I... can I...",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, how many times did we---",spongebob,1
Uh-oh!,not spongebob,0
Wasn't me!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I, I guess I can't handle it after all I... I'm a failure!",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, what makes you say that?",spongebob,1
"Well, not everything is broken.",not spongebob,0
Sa..S...S..San....Sandy!  How was the inventors convention?,spongebob,1
Did you bring back any souvenirs?,not spongebob,0
"Funny, y'all should ask that.",not spongebob,0
It is?,spongebob,1
Yep. I brought home something real handy.,not spongebob,0
And I'm setting it to maximum power.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye.",not spongebob,0
I never thought I go out like this.,spongebob,1
At a handsome squirrel?,not spongebob,0
"No, with a fishbowl on my head.",spongebob,1
"Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success.",not spongebob,0
Experiment?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist!",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,spongebob,1
Uh-oh!,not spongebob,0
Wasn't me!,not spongebob,0
"Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha!",not spongebob,0
"Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right, Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy?   Sandy?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hi.  Gary, I feel funny inside.",spongebob,1
Yow!,spongebob,1
Hello.,spongebob,1
"Gary, there's something inside of me.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
You see anything?,spongebob,1
"Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hello.",spongebob,1
"Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you Prickles!",spongebob,1
I see you!,spongebob,1
"Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a pet—Gary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one.",spongebob,1
"Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't want to hear the little guy cry.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Such a sad story.,spongebob,1
"Okay, little buddy, but just for one night.",spongebob,1
"Nighty-night, Prickles.",spongebob,1
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited?  I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow.",not spongebob,0
Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!,spongebob,1
"3,000 Wup-poos later...",not spongebob,0
Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!,spongebob,1
"Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.",spongebob,1
Guys? Guy—guys?,spongebob,1
"Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.",spongebob,1
"Ow!  Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!",spongebob,1
"Gary, I need to take a shower.",spongebob,1
I did not need to see that! Ugh!,not spongebob,0
"All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.",spongebob,1
"Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the—  Sweet Dutchman's ghost!  When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.",not spongebob,0
"I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir.",spongebob,1
"If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.",not spongebob,0
"I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second?  Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.",spongebob,1
Squatters rights? What the heck is squatters rights?,spongebob,1
"Oh, they're lawyering up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.",spongebob,1
"Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy condisherin'.",not spongebob,0
Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid—,not spongebob,0
"On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!",not spongebob,0
And don't come back until you're dewormed!,not spongebob,0
What am I gonna do?,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and I lost my job over it.",spongebob,1
"Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.",not spongebob,0
"Anything, Plankton! Anything!",spongebob,1
Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!,not spongebob,0
"Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.",not spongebob,0
"You're on your own, worm boy.",not spongebob,0
Soon after...,not spongebob,0
Hello?,not spongebob,0
You gotta help me!,spongebob,1
Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—",spongebob,1
Aw! Hmm?,spongebob,1
Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!  I need a hug!,spongebob,1
Does that mean no hug?,spongebob,1
"There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!",not spongebob,0
"Well, this is my life from now on, huh?  Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms!",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! I need a hug!,not spongebob,0
"See anything yet, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I need my glasses.  Hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck!,not spongebob,0
Our package!,not spongebob,0
I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob SquarePants?,not spongebob,0
That's me!,spongebob,1
That's a big box!,not spongebob,0
Thank you!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?",not spongebob,0
"Thirty more seconds, Patrick.",spongebob,1
They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  Huh? A brand-new television?,not spongebob,0
Easy... easy...,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?",not spongebob,0
"Pretty smart, huh?",spongebob,1
I thought it wouldn't work.,not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!",spongebob,1
"Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?",not spongebob,0
"With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!",spongebob,1
A starfish!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're already a starfish.",not spongebob,0
"See, Squidward? It works! You try!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!",spongebob,1
Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!,not spongebob,0
Let's go for it!  Gloves!,spongebob,1
Check.,not spongebob,0
Hats!,spongebob,1
Check.,not spongebob,0
Underwear!,spongebob,1
Uh... check!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.",spongebob,1
You got it!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!",spongebob,1
I hope they put some air holes in that box.,not spongebob,0
"Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!",spongebob,1
I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!,not spongebob,0
Now where's that remote?,not spongebob,0
I am the lizard king! Whoo!,not spongebob,0
Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!",spongebob,1
What should we keep down?,not spongebob,0
Morons.,not spongebob,0
Our voices!,spongebob,1
Will you two shut up?!  Sponge... Bob?,not spongebob,0
Hold me.,not spongebob,0
"Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, I can't do that!",spongebob,1
Why not?,not spongebob,0
Because I already cut off my own arms!,spongebob,1
Nooooo!,not spongebob,0
What the? How were you two making that noise?,not spongebob,0
"What noise, Squidward?",spongebob,1
I could only hear the sound of our laughter.,not spongebob,0
"Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...",not spongebob,0
Don't forget the second avalanche.,not spongebob,0
Forget it.  I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television.,not spongebob,0
"Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!",not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
Grrrr... Aha!  How are you two doing that?,not spongebob,0
"First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...",spongebob,1
The noises! How are you two making those noises?,not spongebob,0
That's easy. All you need is a box.,not spongebob,0
And...  ...imagination.,spongebob,1
Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.,not spongebob,0
That's good. Now all you need is a box.,not spongebob,0
I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet?,not spongebob,0
Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!,not spongebob,0
"What do they want with me? What did I do?  Obviously I violated some new boxing law!  Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!",not spongebob,0
"You'll never take me alive, coppers!",not spongebob,0
"No, Johnny! Don't do it!",not spongebob,0
Whoopee! Another box!,not spongebob,0
I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV.,not spongebob,0
It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly.,not spongebob,0
The equation is demonstrated here by this box.,not spongebob,0
"I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box.",not spongebob,0
That's what I got you!,not spongebob,0
Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?!,not spongebob,0
And welcome back to Championship Boxing.,not spongebob,0
"Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes.  I give up.",not spongebob,0
3... 2... 1... blast off!,not spongebob,0
"How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think!",not spongebob,0
Shh!  Squidward's such a jerk.,spongebob,1
"Laugh at me, will they?  All right, where is it?",not spongebob,0
Here I am!,not spongebob,0
"Where's what, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Don't Where's what, Squidward? me! Where's the tape recorder?",not spongebob,0
"We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Don't We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward! me!",not spongebob,0
But we don't!,spongebob,1
We have a tape recorder box.,not spongebob,0
"All right, make way you two, I'm coming in.",not spongebob,0
"Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S...  ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?",spongebob,1
"No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is about! It's about...  ...imagination.",spongebob,1
"All right, fine!  Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is!",spongebob,1
Beep-beep-beep.,not spongebob,0
Arr.,spongebob,1
Beep-boop-bee-boop.,not spongebob,0
Ahoy matey!,spongebob,1
Beep-beep.,not spongebob,0
For that you'll walk the plank!,spongebob,1
"Why won't this thing turn on?!  All right, fine. If you don't want to show me,  I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to!",not spongebob,0
I need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!,not spongebob,0
I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, see you in the morning.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hello, what's this?  This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had!",not spongebob,0
"Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.",spongebob,1
Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line!  I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there!  Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, our box is gone!",spongebob,1
"Oh, well.",not spongebob,0
I know! Let's go see Squidward!,spongebob,1
I hope he's not too down in the dumps today.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks.",not spongebob,0
"See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.",not spongebob,0
"I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, I forgot.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy, watch me do the Grouchy Squidward.",spongebob,1
Stop naming moves after me!,not spongebob,0
Everybody's an idiot except for me.,spongebob,1
"Well, it's true.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!,not spongebob,0
Like this?,spongebob,1
"No, your other bottom!",not spongebob,0
Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?,not spongebob,0
Not until 4.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, that's gotta hurt.",not spongebob,0
Do it again! I wasn't looking!,not spongebob,0
"Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.",not spongebob,0
My what has a what now?,spongebob,1
"Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing.  It took twenty hours to put it all back together.  We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick . Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there.   In the Iron Butt.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, man. It itches.",not spongebob,0
"You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!",spongebob,1
What's your problem?,not spongebob,0
Whew. That was close.,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player.  Nice catch, Percy!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!  You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine!  Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.",not spongebob,0
Next.,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
Is this where the line starts?,not spongebob,0
My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
That was fun.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?",spongebob,1
Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.",spongebob,1
That's crazy talk!,not spongebob,0
That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk.  Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.",spongebob,1
Or your other armpit!,not spongebob,0
I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary.,spongebob,1
Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?,not spongebob,0
I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.,spongebob,1
"Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?",not spongebob,0
No problem!  A really long spatula.,spongebob,1
What about eating?,not spongebob,0
I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!",not spongebob,0
"Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again.",spongebob,1
Never ever?,not spongebob,0
Never ever ever!,spongebob,1
Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!,not spongebob,0
Never ever never never ever ever never!!,spongebob,1
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!,not spongebob,0
Never ever...,spongebob,1
Never never never never ever never ever never…,not spongebob,0
"Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?",spongebob,1
"Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.",not spongebob,0
"And that's when I  punch him, right?",not spongebob,0
Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun.,not spongebob,0
I caught one!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting.  I think I caught one!",spongebob,1
We've got to try something else!,not spongebob,0

Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.,not spongebob,0
Once again your master plan is fatally flawed.  It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium.,not spongebob,0
Dahahaha! That tickles.,not spongebob,0
"Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B.  Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name!  Huh? Oh yeah.",not spongebob,0
"I am ready, I am ready, I am ready. Ready to destroy Christmas.",not spongebob,0
"What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!",not spongebob,0
"I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch.  Ow!  Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?",not spongebob,0
"Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes.  Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty?  With a side of blue cheese dressing.",not spongebob,0
Squawk! What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,not spongebob,0
"Why are you looking at me like that, bird?  What are you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Merry Christmas, fellas!",spongebob,1
"Ah, go stuff a stocking!",not spongebob,0
"Gee. That wasn't very nice.  Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!",not spongebob,0
"What's that all about?  Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?",spongebob,1
"I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob!  I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.",not spongebob,0
"Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters.",spongebob,1
"Nosybody.  Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will.",spongebob,1
"Merry Christmas, Frankie.",not spongebob,0
"Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny.",not spongebob,0
"More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help.  Squidward!",spongebob,1
I'm not home!,not spongebob,0
"Oh gosh, what do I do now?",spongebob,1
Why don't you go bother Sandy?,not spongebob,0
"Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home.",spongebob,1
"I said I'm not home!  SpongeBob, give me back my door!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why.",spongebob,1
Why should I help all them jerks?,not spongebob,0
"Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.",spongebob,1
Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!",spongebob,1
"Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer!  Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake!  This is terrible!",not spongebob,0
"What is it, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"From Plankton, he baked it.",spongebob,1
You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
You're an idiot.,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.,not spongebob,0
Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!,spongebob,1
"Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason, it's not affecting you.  It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula.  Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song!  Sandy, The song is the antidote!",spongebob,1
Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat!,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, everybody!",spongebob,1
"♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!  Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas! When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪",spongebob,1

"Oh, no!",spongebob,1
"Oh, yes. It seems you're all on my naughty list this year.",not spongebob,0
Naughty list?!,spongebob,1
No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks.,not spongebob,0

But nothing. Coal for everyone! Except Plankton.,not spongebob,0
Wha-a-at!,not spongebob,0

"On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now—wreaking havoc!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
I am ready to destroy Christmas.  Destroy Santa.,not spongebob,0

Thanks again for saving my keister.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it was nothing.",spongebob,1
"You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity.  What have we got there? If found, please return to the Chum Bucket? Plankton?!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
"Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse.",not spongebob,0

"I sure would, Santa.",not spongebob,0

That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!,spongebob,1
Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?",spongebob,1
What's a Gary?,not spongebob,0
Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello!,spongebob,1
Yuck. You actually care for that thing?,not spongebob,0
I love Gary!,spongebob,1

"Actually, a three day weekend.",spongebob,1
"As in, not here for three days?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.",spongebob,1
"Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!",not spongebob,0
I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.,not spongebob,0
You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.,spongebob,1

We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.,not spongebob,0
"We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?",spongebob,1
Almost some.,not spongebob,0
I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.,spongebob,1
Wanna go to the park?,not spongebob,0
Karate sure is dumb.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, you can say that again.",not spongebob,0
I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!,spongebob,1
You like what?,not spongebob,0
Not karate.,spongebob,1
Ha! I don't even know what that is.,not spongebob,0
"Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...",spongebob,1
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
"For a second, that sounded like.",spongebob,1
Karate?,not spongebob,0
"Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?",spongebob,1
Karate.,not spongebob,0
What did you say?,spongebob,1
"Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich.  There we go.",not spongebob,0
How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?,spongebob,1
One. Just one.,not spongebob,0
One for you!,spongebob,1
Hmmm?,not spongebob,0
And one for me!,spongebob,1
"Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Hmm?,spongebob,1
"Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Sandy.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
"Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, sure.",spongebob,1
Thanks. Hi-yah!  Is that enough?,not spongebob,0
Maybe just one more. Or two!,spongebob,1
Or three!,not spongebob,0
Or ten!,spongebob,1
"Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
Right!,not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
Right!,not spongebob,0
Time for buns!,spongebob,1
How about some tomatoes?,not spongebob,0
And I'll cut the cheese!,spongebob,1
"And, what else should we slice?",not spongebob,0
More buns!,spongebob,1
And lettuce!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy?  Right? I guess I'll eat one now.",spongebob,1
You're mince meat!,not spongebob,0
In your dreams! Hi-yah!,spongebob,1
Huh? What the barnacle?,not spongebob,0
Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?,spongebob,1
Bleuhahugh!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs!  Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going?  Nice day, huh?  Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.",spongebob,1
Fire ya?  I've got something else in mind.,not spongebob,0
I love karate!,not spongebob,0
I love kara-tay!,spongebob,1
I love money-ay!,not spongebob,0
I hate all of you.,not spongebob,0
"All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here.",spongebob,1
Special delivery for SpongeBob SquarePants.,not spongebob,0
Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?,spongebob,1
"Alright, do we have to go through this every time I give you your mail? Sheesh.",not spongebob,0
"What could it be today, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
A videotape?  You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants. I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!,spongebob,1
"Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.",not spongebob,0
King of Karate?,spongebob,1
Now it's your turn...,not spongebob,0
...SpongeBob SquarePants.,not spongebob,0
You've won an all-expense paid trip to Karate Island! Hi-yah! Where you'll be crowned this year's King of Karate!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!",spongebob,1
"Howdy, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.",spongebob,1
Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.",spongebob,1
"But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.",not spongebob,0
"Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.",spongebob,1
There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.,not spongebob,0
"All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?",spongebob,1
Yup. That's it over there.,not spongebob,0
What make you think that's Karate Island?,spongebob,1
I don't know -- lucky guess?,not spongebob,0
"Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.",spongebob,1
"Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you.",spongebob,1
I am Master Udon.,not spongebob,0
"Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.",spongebob,1
"Oh, brother.",not spongebob,0
"Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"You hear that, Sandy? He called me master. Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.",not spongebob,0
"Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?",spongebob,1
Something smells like rancid rodeo around here.,not spongebob,0
"Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.",not spongebob,0
The one and only.,spongebob,1
We must make ready for your coronation.,not spongebob,0
I'm ready to be King of Karate!,spongebob,1
"King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.",not spongebob,0
My throne.,spongebob,1
"All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.",not spongebob,0
"Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, y'all are getting a bit wily.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.",not spongebob,0
But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.,spongebob,1
I'm getting off this crazy train!,not spongebob,0
"Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.  Let the coronation begin!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy's going to miss out, big time.",spongebob,1
That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob's in trouble!  SpongeBob is the King of Karate. He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.",spongebob,1
"Hold on, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"No, Sandy!",spongebob,1
She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style.  Ha-ha. Look!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Prepare for the tickling of your life!,not spongebob,0
Taste these!,not spongebob,0
Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?,not spongebob,0
"No one can resist jelly-filled.  Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.",not spongebob,0
I could use a wet napkin.,not spongebob,0
"All right, who's next?",not spongebob,0
"Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style.",not spongebob,0
"Dance, squirrel, dance.",not spongebob,0
Advanced hair-dryer style!,not spongebob,0
"What do you expect to do with that?  Oh, no! Not chapped lips!",not spongebob,0
That's enough lip out of you.,not spongebob,0
"No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor.",not spongebob,0
"Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.",not spongebob,0
"Fresh-air dome?  Man, I really do stink.",not spongebob,0
You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.,not spongebob,0
Release SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Never.  He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
Real estate.,not spongebob,0
You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?,not spongebob,0
"Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.",not spongebob,0
You mean I'm not King of Karate?,spongebob,1
"No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple.  See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?",not spongebob,0
"Don't do it, Sandy!",spongebob,1
I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!,not spongebob,0
Then give into my fists.,not spongebob,0
"You're in the soup now, Udon!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo.",spongebob,1
"Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.",not spongebob,0
"I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?",spongebob,1
"You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location...",not spongebob,0
I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived!,not spongebob,0
"HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! 'Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?!",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese?  Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you!",not spongebob,0
Buddy! You okay?,not spongebob,0
"Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA!",spongebob,1
Hey! I want to learn how to do that.,not spongebob,0
"What, what, you mean karate?",spongebob,1
Uh-huh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...",spongebob,1
"If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.",not spongebob,0
Yeah... However...,spongebob,1
"I also remember you saying, If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface.",spongebob,1
Then teach me.,not spongebob,0
"As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.",spongebob,1
Oh yeah! Mama!,not spongebob,0
Okay. Let's start off simple. This is a basic move called the inverted whirlpool.,spongebob,1
Inverty whirpey... Got it!,not spongebob,0
Woohoo! That was awesome!,not spongebob,0
Think you can handle that?,spongebob,1
"Yeah! Yeah!  Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!  Hey, how do you stop this thing?",not spongebob,0
Neptune's trousers! What's that?!,not spongebob,0
"Now, this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?",spongebob,1
Definitely!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable.",spongebob,1
What?! I...!  Barnacles!,not spongebob,0
"Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No one's ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through solid cinder!",spongebob,1
Wow!,not spongebob,0
You're a natural! A karate genius!,spongebob,1
Clamo!,not spongebob,0
"Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing!",spongebob,1
"This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes?",spongebob,1
Ahhh... better luck next time.,spongebob,1
Yeah! I bet I can chop anything!,not spongebob,0
AAAAAHHHH!,not spongebob,0
HIIIII-,not spongebob,0
Noooooo! What did I tell you?!,spongebob,1
I'm a genius?,not spongebob,0
Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?,spongebob,1
Yesss...,not spongebob,0
"Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.",spongebob,1
Okay! I'm a genius!,not spongebob,0
Karate power!,not spongebob,0
What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look, it's Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Hi-yah, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
What are you doing...,spongebob,1
Dear Neptune!,spongebob,1
"Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!",not spongebob,0
A... What?,not spongebob,0
I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?,not spongebob,0
Looks delish.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?",spongebob,1
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.",not spongebob,0
"But, but, but-",spongebob,1
No buts! Just hands.,not spongebob,0
Oooohhh!,spongebob,1
You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.,not spongebob,0
"Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch!  Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!",not spongebob,0
"We're all out. In fact, we're out of everything, which means you owe us $86.50",not spongebob,0
What do you say to a trade?,not spongebob,0
"I say, pay up before I call the cops.",not spongebob,0
You dare refuse my barter?!?! Then accept my chop!  Ahhh... I don't feel so good.,not spongebob,0
"Aha! Hand in the tip jar again, eh!",not spongebob,0
What is that wonderful stench?  Whatcha got there?,not spongebob,0
Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?,not spongebob,0
NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha!,not spongebob,0
"I win, I win, I win!",not spongebob,0
HIYAA HIYAA-,not spongebob,0
Help! Help! There's a mad chopper on the loose!,not spongebob,0
Mad chopper?! Patrick!,spongebob,1
"We need the cops, kid!",not spongebob,0
"Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.",spongebob,1
Don't do it kid.,not spongebob,0
"Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.",spongebob,1
You don't know what you're doing. Don't walk out that door! NOOOOO!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy.",not spongebob,0
For what?,spongebob,1
"For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.",not spongebob,0
"You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!",spongebob,1
Wooooooooooo.,not spongebob,0
"Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"You got it, buddy. No more karate chops!",not spongebob,0
You're still chopping!,spongebob,1
"I know! Weird, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, stop it!",spongebob,1
"Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop!",not spongebob,0
You must resist!  AHHHHHAAHH!,spongebob,1
"Wait up, Patrick!  Triton's tunic!",spongebob,1
He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!,not spongebob,0
"HIYA YA! Oh, no! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH!",not spongebob,0
"This just in, a mad man is chopping everything.",not spongebob,0
Not the giant-screen TVs!  Oh no!,not spongebob,0
"The suspect is considered fat, pink, and dangerous.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA!",not spongebob,0
"Pull it together, buddy!",spongebob,1
"I'm trying to, but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn...  YAAAAAA!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  Oh, no! I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag.",not spongebob,0
"That isn't your friend, you kelp-for-brains. Those are cleaning sponges.",not spongebob,0
So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?,not spongebob,0
Ummmm...I wouldn't say that.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Oh no!  Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself  No! I'll never forgive you!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're okay!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! Your arm!,spongebob,1
"Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?",not spongebob,0
Hooray for regeneration!,spongebob,1
"And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the architectural details.",spongebob,1
HIYAAA!,not spongebob,0
Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.",not spongebob,0
HIYYAA!,not spongebob,0
"Another bag of chum...  Bleh, now to shape this into his Highness' dinner request.",not spongebob,0
Almost done.,not spongebob,0
Here you go. Eat up.,not spongebob,0
What's this supposed to be?,not spongebob,0
"Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea. Also known as dinner.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I told you months ago that my memory is full but you've been too busy with your latest project. So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?",not spongebob,0
"Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you, foolproof!  Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife!",not spongebob,0
Karen 2!,not spongebob,0
Karen 2?! I've been...replaced?!,not spongebob,0
"I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package!",not spongebob,0
I can't believe this! And after all I've done for you! You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.",not spongebob,0
Who are you calling cheap?! At least I don't rust!,not spongebob,0
"You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.",not spongebob,0
Oh that does it!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.",not spongebob,0
And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?,not spongebob,0
"Here's your stir fry, little man!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret!",not spongebob,0
You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system!,not spongebob,0
"Huh, what happened?",not spongebob,0
"I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source.",not spongebob,0
"Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard! Goodbye, Karen Classic,  hello, Karen 2!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the end of another lucrative work day, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear.",spongebob,1
"Seriously, son, you gotta lighten up. Well, good night, kiddo.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, sir.  See ya tomorrow.",spongebob,1
"Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.",not spongebob,0
"Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye  Toodaloo! Whoa!",spongebob,1
"Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash.",not spongebob,0
This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system.,spongebob,1
Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?,not spongebob,0
"Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton.",spongebob,1
Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.,not spongebob,0
Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?,spongebob,1
"Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer?  Let's plug her in, see what she can do.",not spongebob,0
She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works.  This thing does text mails right?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I think so.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that sounds promising.",not spongebob,0
"Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.",not spongebob,0
Don't tell me not to cry!,not spongebob,0
She's malfunctioning!,not spongebob,0
Must be the dial-up thingy!,spongebob,1
"You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry!",not spongebob,0
"Oh it's not the dial-up thingy. It's Plankton, he dumped me for a newer piece of hardware.",not spongebob,0
"Help me out here, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean, you guys were made for each other. Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?",spongebob,1
You men are all alike!,not spongebob,0
"Wait! Where ya goin’? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth.  Let's talk this out.",not spongebob,0
"Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what part of free computer are you not understanding?",not spongebob,0
"Tonight, we celebrate, and tomorrow, the secret formula.",not spongebob,0
"I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live. Goodbye, you miserable little bug!",not spongebob,0
"Well, in the case, welcome aboard!",not spongebob,0
All right!,spongebob,1
Yeehaw!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?,not spongebob,0
My order?,not spongebob,0
"I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on, Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her.",not spongebob,0
"So, I'm fired? No more taking orders?  No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob?! I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free!  Whoo.",not spongebob,0
"Not so fast, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Hi there, can I get a Krabby Patty and a side of coral bits please?",not spongebob,0
"You'll get your Krabby Patty when I'm good and ready!  Sorry, I'm just...  ...going through a lot emotionally, right now.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?",spongebob,1
You defragment your hard drive?,not spongebob,0
"No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself, you know.",not spongebob,0
"I'm trying to open the door. You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I suppose that's true. All right, I got this.  What's she doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?!",not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker.",not spongebob,0
And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been.,not spongebob,0
Analog? Who you calling analog?!,not spongebob,0
I see you've taken your proper role as a Cash Machine.,not spongebob,0
At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!,not spongebob,0
"Well, at least I can say I was designed.",not spongebob,0
Why I oughta...!,not spongebob,0
You rusty bucket of bolts.,not spongebob,0
You glorified toaster oven!,not spongebob,0
You poor excuse for a house wife.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's going on?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side.",not spongebob,0
Seriously? Did you just say money?,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?",not spongebob,0
Prepare to have your motherboard rattled.,not spongebob,0
...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?,not spongebob,0
You're about to have your cookies crumbled!,not spongebob,0
Bring it.,not spongebob,0
Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.,not spongebob,0
That will defrag your algorithms.,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
Plankton?,not spongebob,0
Stop! He's hurt!,not spongebob,0
You're throwing in the towel?,not spongebob,0
You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!,not spongebob,0
"No one runs down my man. Planky, say something...",not spongebob,0
"Take me home, baby...",not spongebob,0
"Even though you are a tiny green loser, I could never stay...  ... mad  ...at  ...you.",not spongebob,0
"Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again!",not spongebob,0
"I hope this works... Oh, Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again!",not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
"I had a reality check, that's what happened.",not spongebob,0
"Come on. Let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey.",not spongebob,0
I had the strangest dream. I dreamt there were two of me!,not spongebob,0
"Two of you? Heh, well that is strange.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?",not spongebob,0
"Well, we could rebuild Karen 2.",spongebob,1
"Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?",not spongebob,0
"Keep it up, Mr. Squidward. The kids love robots.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, I—",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Planky-Bear!  I'm just a little distracted waiting for our baby to be delivered.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, that makes sense.  A baby?! I don't want a baby!",not spongebob,0
It's too late to stop it now.  It's been nine months and the baby is no longer on back order.,not spongebob,0
Can we ask for store credit instead?,not spongebob,0
My baby's here!,not spongebob,0
Not if I have anything to say about it.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Planky-Poo, look how cute our baby is!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, that thing isn't even a graphing calculator. Weak.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on.  How can you look at our baby's itty wittle keyboard and say he's not the cutest?  I have the perfect name for him. Well, don't you wanna know the name?",not spongebob,0
Not really.,not spongebob,0
It's Chip.  He's named after my grandfather.,not spongebob,0
"Great, here we go with the crying! Will you please hush that thing up?!",not spongebob,0
There you go. All better.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, how did you do that so fast?",not spongebob,0
"Simple, I just typed 4-4-4-5 in his cute little keyboard.",not spongebob,0
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
Shhh.,not spongebob,0
At least it can't get more annoying.,not spongebob,0
Hello!,spongebob,1
"A little drone told me you two are new parents. So, I just had to bring over a little present for the baby. Hello, baby.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I think little Chip likes you.",not spongebob,0
Obviously not the brightest diode in the box.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Chip, your uncle SpongeBob got you a little something.  It's a can of compressed air to keep your keys nice and clean, like this!",spongebob,1
Phew.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, walk to Mommy.",not spongebob,0
That's it. You can do it.,not spongebob,0
"You're walking, baby!",not spongebob,0
You call that walking? This is walking.  This is how you do it. This is how it's done.,not spongebob,0
Ah! Mama's big boy is upgrading!,not spongebob,0
Aw.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, ah!  This stinks!",not spongebob,0
Let's see if we can find some friends for Mama's special little boy.  You need to interface with someone fun. Try that video game over there. It doesn't look too dangerous.,not spongebob,0
"Careful, Chip.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, those monsters are too big. Come out of that game right now!",not spongebob,0
"Chip, get out of there!",not spongebob,0
So you think you can do whatever you want because you're a teenager now? You just wait until I tell your father.,not spongebob,0
What did you just say to me?!,not spongebob,0
"I told Chip that game was too dangerous, and do you know what he said to me?",not spongebob,0
And?,not spongebob,0
Just talk to your son! I need to cool my circuits.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, uh, hey, buddy. Heh, what you doing?",not spongebob,0
Eh…,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I hear you. So, uh, what happened at the arcade?",not spongebob,0
"What? You mother stopped your game, even though you were crushing it? Your mother clearly doesn't get you, man. But I have the perfect solution to your problem. Run away.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, I said run away. Take off, see the world. You do you.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, now get out of here, you little scamp.",not spongebob,0
"So, how was your talk with Chip?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it went great. He's a good boy.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, he wh—  Where—where is he?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he ran away.",not spongebob,0
What?! Why would my baby run away?,not spongebob,0
Because I told him to. Duh.,not spongebob,0
"Karen, baby, let's be reasonable here!",not spongebob,0
You find our son and bring him home this instant or don't bother coming home!,not spongebob,0
I'm going! I'm going!,not spongebob,0
"Chip! Chip! Where are you, boy? Come to Daddy! Ugh, what am I saying? Chip! Chip!",not spongebob,0
"Psst, hey, kid, you lost?",not spongebob,0
Meh.,not spongebob,0
"Running away from home, huh? Cool! Why don't you come hang with me and my buddies?  Oh, don't be scared. In here. Check it out, guys. I found us a new friend.",not spongebob,0
"I know, right? It is cool here. There's just one thing. If you wanna be part of us, we're gonna need your parts.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, kid, don't be like that. We've all done it.",not spongebob,0
Get him!,not spongebob,0
"Chip! Your mother's gonna kill me if I can't find you.  Huh?  That's him! He's in trouble! Don't worry, son! Daddy is coming!  Get away from my son!  Get away from me!",not spongebob,0
Father!  Leave my father alone!,not spongebob,0
Your first word was father. Wait until I rub this in Karen's face.,not spongebob,0
No! The delicious horror!  Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you should've seen it, Karen. Chip was all like, Stay away from my daddy, who is the most brilliant, handsome genius in the world.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, we have got the best kid ever!",not spongebob,0
Oh!  Aw.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, son, let your old man buy you a quart of oil.  Whoo-hoo!  Yes!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Dad, I'd love to, but I'm leaving for college.",not spongebob,0
I went to college.,not spongebob,0
Eight semesters later...,not spongebob,0

Hey!  Hey! Give me my money!,not spongebob,0
That's my boy!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it was so great catching up with you, Hanna.  It's been too long.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you poor thing. Sounds like you have a bug. Better go home and reboot.  Remember, only keywords tonight. You need to rest your processor.",not spongebob,0
Karen!,not spongebob,0
What do you want?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. Your nodes are swollen. That old bucket of bolts gave you a computer virus.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nonsense. I'm the fastest computer alive.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh.  My ones and zeroes look like 10, 10, 10, 10.",not spongebob,0
Someone's gonna have to get inside you and kill that virus. It's probably a suicide mission.  But who would be stupid enough to— What now?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm just helping out the Health Department.",spongebob,1
"Hmm.  Sanitary notice. The Chum Bucket hereby gets a grade Z from the Health Department.  Hey, that's up from a negative Z last week.",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Plankton. In a few more years, you're sure to get an F.  Whoa!",spongebob,1

Your garbage.,spongebob,1
Where's my house?,not spongebob,0
On top of your garbage.  The dump was closed.  So I bought it here.,spongebob,1
How?,not spongebob,0
Like this.  Do you wanna try?,spongebob,1

"SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Patties and less heavy breathing?",not spongebob,0
Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath: three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next.,spongebob,1
Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness.  Tentacles crossed.,not spongebob,0
Silly Squidward. I'm not going to--,spongebob,1
What's going on around here?,not spongebob,0
What's going on?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession...  ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪",spongebob,1
Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... the cat?,not spongebob,0
"He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney.  And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat.  That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality.  Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals?  Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?,spongebob,1
"Uh, no.",not spongebob,0
But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?,spongebob,1
Never noticed it.,not spongebob,0
Huh. You haven't seen him in your wallet?,not spongebob,0
Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans.",spongebob,1
"Hundreds, you say?",not spongebob,0
Maybe even a thousand!,spongebob,1

"Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?",spongebob,1
Cat?!  In what way am I kind of like a cat?,not spongebob,0
"Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?",spongebob,1
"We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.",spongebob,1
"I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me!",not spongebob,0
"Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could someone be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity?",spongebob,1

"Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.",not spongebob,0
But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo!,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is.  10:00! Kenny Time!",not spongebob,0

Kenny!,spongebob,1
"Thanks, Kenny!",not spongebob,0
"Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.  Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign!  Swoon! Swoon!",spongebob,1
"One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's.  And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars.  Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host.  Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. the Cat? Everything OK?  Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?",spongebob,1
"What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! A clean cat is a moneymaking cat, I always say. Please avail yourself of the lounge facilities.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.",spongebob,1
This gets real uncomfortable after a while.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to…  Whoa!",spongebob,1
"Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.",not spongebob,0
"How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!",spongebob,1
But it's not what you think!,not spongebob,0
There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, wait!",not spongebob,0
"I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore.  Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? : You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get...  depressed.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, please, let me explain! I'm just a cat with a dream. A dream to give the gift of hope. See, above water, I'm a nobody: just another annoying cat. But down here, I'm someone special: someone who can make people happy. And if making the world a happier place makes me a criminal...  ...then lock me up and throw away the key. Have mercy!",not spongebob,0
"All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, really.",not spongebob,0
"All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got to sign some autographs.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the cat of the hour is back!",not spongebob,0
"All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs?",not spongebob,0
"Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.",not spongebob,0
"Sir, I just want to say that you're the biggest inspiration myself and my friends have ever known. Your ability to hold your breath changed our lives... forever.",not spongebob,0
"You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem.  You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat?",not spongebob,0
"Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature?  Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.",not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
"I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic,  considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?",spongebob,1
"What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin,  followed by eventual unconsciousness.",not spongebob,0
I can't take it! I need oxygen!,not spongebob,0
I knew Kenny was a fake!,not spongebob,0
Liar!,not spongebob,0
"No! Come back!  Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.",spongebob,1
"Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.",spongebob,1
I like it!,not spongebob,0
Just get out of here already.  You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?,not spongebob,0
You know that child we were planning on having?,not spongebob,0
Let's forget it.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks,  and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work.",spongebob,1
They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?,not spongebob,0
I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.,spongebob,1
So what do I need to do for them?,not spongebob,0
"Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh!  Hm!  Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze.  Whoa-ow-ow-ow!}",spongebob,1
"When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything?  What do you call this gizmo you made anyway?",not spongebob,0
The Takeover-er-er.,not spongebob,0
That's just stupid.,not spongebob,0
Morning.,spongebob,1
Morning…,not spongebob,0
And don't forget your rube goldfish device!  There we go.,not spongebob,0
"Honey, I'm home.  What's this stupid thing?",not spongebob,0
"Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now.  Oh, my!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh?  Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up!",not spongebob,0
This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys.  Alley-oop!,not spongebob,0
"Too small, too small!  Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, why are you idiots so short?  You afraid of me? You gonna cry?",not spongebob,0
"Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see?  Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?",not spongebob,0
"Um, I am the king.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah? Well, now I'm the king!",not spongebob,0
"Wow!  Thank you, sir! I mean, sire.  I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!",not spongebob,0
"Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart!  That's why!  Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall!",not spongebob,0
"That's right, bring me all your valuables.  What are those? Dentures? Hand them over.  Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff!  I'm tired of walking. Carry me!",not spongebob,0
Father!,not spongebob,0
"Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea!  Hi-yah!  Okay, that's enough. I'm bored.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah!  I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you.  Ow!  Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go.  Hi-yah!",not spongebob,0
"Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world!  I rule you, I rule you,  and I...rule...you...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king,  I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down.  I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down!  Guys? My people? Loyal subjects?  Buddies?",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice!",not spongebob,0
Sacrifice?,not spongebob,0
Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent.  Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!,not spongebob,0
Hey! Whoa!  Yuck! Time to un-shrink!  Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!,not spongebob,0
Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.,not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"What do you mean, aww? Don't aww!",not spongebob,0
Ow!  That hurt!  Now that snack's got a bite.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!",not spongebob,0
Huh? How did you get over there?  Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you're welcome!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, dumbbell!  Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me!  It stretches. Go!  You morons should cushion my fall nicely.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time.",spongebob,1
I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing!,not spongebob,0
I hear 'em in there.,spongebob,1
"Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?",not spongebob,0
"No, don't touch that!",not spongebob,0
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!  I take it back. They weren't that delicious.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here.",not spongebob,0
Partially digested antennae.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner.",spongebob,1
"Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live.",not spongebob,0
Plankton! Abandon bucket!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a write off.",not spongebob,0
"Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!",spongebob,1
"Not today, SpongeBob. Not today.  But...someday!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, Karen, please!",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you must know...",not spongebob,0
"There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why, look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise.   Delectable!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sure it'll be a huge success!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, so what about the Krabby Kola?",not spongebob,0
"We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, well then, can I just make sure I get those Krabby Fries with extra Krabby Sauce?",not spongebob,0
"Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab, which is located directly across the street!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, thanks for the directions.",not spongebob,0
"Any time. What is wrong with people?! Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and if anyone ever did order one of your meals, it probably would look them in the eye.",not spongebob,0
"You know, Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall.",not spongebob,0
"Maybe in heels. If it wasn't for me, you probably wouldn't even remember to blink!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!",not spongebob,0
What's the matter?,not spongebob,0
My eye is burning and I don't know why!,not spongebob,0
Blink.,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?",not spongebob,0
You were threatening to replace me.,not spongebob,0
Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, puh-leeze.",not spongebob,0
I'll show you woman!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Karen!",not spongebob,0
Now what!?,not spongebob,0
Could you come here for a moment?,not spongebob,0
What do you want?,not spongebob,0
"Feast your, uh, screen on this.",not spongebob,0
That’s my replacement!? It’s a toaster!,not spongebob,0
"Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, T-119A!",not spongebob,0
"They're supposed to do that.  Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.",not spongebob,0
That'll help you get the formula.,not spongebob,0
"And now, Karen, the piece de resistance.  Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?",not spongebob,0
It sorta just looks like an old hair dryer taped to the back of a miniature windmill.,not spongebob,0
"I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.",not spongebob,0
"I don't recall you ever having reason to own a hair dryer, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!?",not spongebob,0
What picture!?,not spongebob,0
You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.,not spongebob,0
Why are we even talking about this?,not spongebob,0
Because you were the one that said—,not spongebob,0
What's going on!?,not spongebob,0
Dear Neptune!,not spongebob,0
"Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!",not spongebob,0
Not that one!,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's good to see that that strategy didn't fall flat!",not spongebob,0
"You know, Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhh, so it's my fault is it?",not spongebob,0
"That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!",not spongebob,0
"You and your crack team of robots, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you!  Karen? What's this?  It's words on paper. It says: Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen. Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error.  Ow!  P.S., don't forget to blink. Oh yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?",not spongebob,0
"I said, does everybody understand!?",not spongebob,0
"All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!",not spongebob,0
Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!,not spongebob,0
"This just in, a diabolical albeit haphazardly thrown-together machine is attacking Bikini Bottom and is headed straight for the Krusty Krab!",not spongebob,0
Why is the local news always such rubbish!?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, nobody cares about...",not spongebob,0
"Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boy, get out there.",not spongebob,0
"Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir?  Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?",spongebob,1
"I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?",not spongebob,0
"Uhhhhh, uuh uuh.",spongebob,1
"Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to Krusty Krab. Got it?",not spongebob,0
Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?,spongebob,1
Uhhh! Forget it!  Bring on the Boom Boom!,not spongebob,0
Battle stations men! Here he comes!,not spongebob,0
"We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed!",spongebob,1
Later.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what gives?",not spongebob,0
"Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone.",not spongebob,0
Ahem.,not spongebob,0
Karen! You've come back to me!,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I just came to get my keyboard.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!",not spongebob,0
"Let me guess, another failure?",not spongebob,0
"What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?",not spongebob,0
Do you want me to leave you again?,not spongebob,0
Or we could go out! That'd be fun too.,not spongebob,0
We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.,not spongebob,0
"Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out!  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! OH MY GOSH!  Huh?",spongebob,1
How about a little music to count me money to?,not spongebob,0
And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: Electric Zoo.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad! I love this young people's music!",not spongebob,0
I SURRENDER!!! Oh...,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?",spongebob,1
I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order!,not spongebob,0
"#17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?",spongebob,1
Hilarious. Just deliver the food.,not spongebob,0
"There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
"Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!",spongebob,1
I feel completely recharged!,not spongebob,0
That sounds like Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
"Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.",not spongebob,0
"That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels recharged.  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.",spongebob,1
"Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm... which one, man?",not spongebob,0
"The one that goes bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.",not spongebob,0
"No, man, you're thinking of wee-wub-wub-womp-wub-wub-womp.",not spongebob,0
"Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop...?  Beep?!  Boo-boo-bop?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!",spongebob,1
"That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen!",not spongebob,0
"I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.",spongebob,1
How did you...?,not spongebob,0
"Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"What is it, boy?",not spongebob,0
Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.,spongebob,1
"Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?",not spongebob,0
"Umm... yeah, sure.",not spongebob,0
"Well, let's hear it, lad.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?",not spongebob,0
Why?,not spongebob,0
It was rated ARRGH!  Arrgh! Because it's... about... pirates.,not spongebob,0
"I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!",spongebob,1
"There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"What? What is it, boy?",not spongebob,0
Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?,spongebob,1
"Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break. Now get back to work!",not spongebob,0
Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!",not spongebob,0
"That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.",spongebob,1
"No, wait, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"What is it, SpongeBob?!",not spongebob,0
I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!,spongebob,1
"Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
"Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"OH, MY EYES!!!!",not spongebob,0
Mr...!,spongebob,1
"Will you be quiet?! Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?",not spongebob,0
"Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.",spongebob,1
"Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?!",not spongebob,0
AHHHH! AHHHH!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!!! OHH!!! AHHHH!! AHH! AHHH!! AHHH!!! AAAAHHHHH!!!! AAAHH!,not spongebob,0
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!,not spongebob,0
"I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!",spongebob,1
Hello. You've reached the Navy's automated phone service.,not spongebob,0
Squidward! The robots are running the Navy!,spongebob,1
"NOT THE NAVY!!!!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,spongebob,1
"Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.",not spongebob,0
"We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?",not spongebob,0
"Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.",spongebob,1
They poop on the robot?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.",spongebob,1
"I never thought I'd say this but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!",not spongebob,0
Shut up!,not spongebob,0
"Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!",not spongebob,0
"I said  shut up!, you bucket of bolts!",not spongebob,0
I can't take it!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, are you okay?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!",spongebob,1
"No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.,not spongebob,0
Right.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
What are you talkin' about? I'm Mr. Krabs.,not spongebob,0
We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
I'm Mr. Krabs.,not spongebob,0
Where's Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
I'm Mr. Krabs.,not spongebob,0
Where's Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!,not spongebob,0
This is one stubborn robot.,spongebob,1
WHAT?!  You think I'm a ROBOT?!?!,not spongebob,0
We don't think; we know.,not spongebob,0
That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.,not spongebob,0
"I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his little buddy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.,not spongebob,0
We're just gonna see what your little buddy knows.,not spongebob,0
"No, wait! What are you going to do to me blender?! That cost me money!",not spongebob,0
"Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?",not spongebob,0
NOOOO! That cost me $24.95!,not spongebob,0
I guess it didn't know anything.,spongebob,1
Go get the toaster.,not spongebob,0
"No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",not spongebob,0
"This is the last robot, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!",not spongebob,0
I thought you said robots can't cry.,not spongebob,0
I also said they couldn't love.,spongebob,1
I loved it like it was me own.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, at least he's not laughing.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?",not spongebob,0
"The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.",spongebob,1
SQUIDWARD!!!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar. You are a winner. And today's the first day of summer!Happy first day of summer, Squidward! Care to join me for solstice caroling?Walking in the grass,it's so fine,don't need shoesin the summertime!",spongebob,1
"I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
Whee-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?",spongebob,1
The money!,not spongebob,0
The money?,spongebob,1
"Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!",not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
"You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.",not spongebob,0
Tell me more about summer break.,spongebob,1
"Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!",not spongebob,0
I've been taught the true meaning of summer.,spongebob,1
Later...,not spongebob,0
"Almost closing time, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.",spongebob,1
"Playground? Luring away me young customers? Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"See anything, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.,spongebob,1
"True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Land, sir?",spongebob,1
"Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?",not spongebob,0
Monroe.,not spongebob,0
"Nice to meet you, Monroe.",not spongebob,0
Whee!,not spongebob,0
"Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
We promise.,not spongebob,0
"All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Ooh, where am I?",not spongebob,0
Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!,not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.,not spongebob,0
We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!,not spongebob,0
"Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.,not spongebob,0
Stall 'em? How do I do that?,spongebob,1
I don't know. Be entertaining.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, kids!",spongebob,1
You're not Krabby the Clown.,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!",spongebob,1
Lame.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?",spongebob,1
Still lame.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.",spongebob,1
You stink! Bring on the clown!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, uh... and now for a finale!",spongebob,1
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!,not spongebob,0
"My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.",spongebob,1
Woo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
I got 'em right where I want 'em.,spongebob,1
Woo-hoo! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!  Yeah, woo!  Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,spongebob,1
Yay!  Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.,spongebob,1
"Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?",not spongebob,0
The kids are using them as... boomerangs.,spongebob,1
Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!,not spongebob,0
What are we gonna do?,spongebob,1
"Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!",not spongebob,0
"Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!",spongebob,1
Get out there and tell 'em!,not spongebob,0
"Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!",spongebob,1
Yay!,not spongebob,0
Who do you want?,spongebob,1
Krabby!,not spongebob,0
When do you want him?,spongebob,1
"Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby!  Krabby! Hooray!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?",not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
"All right, here you go!  Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!",not spongebob,0
I'll say you have.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!",spongebob,1
"Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.",not spongebob,0
But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?,spongebob,1
"The children? I don't care about the children!  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose!  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.",not spongebob,0
Ahem.,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.",not spongebob,0
Get him!,not spongebob,0
"I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.",spongebob,1
You mean this morning?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!",not spongebob,0
Yay! Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.,spongebob,1
Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!,not spongebob,0
"…and this is the maximum security level. Since this is your first day, I'll let you peek at our number one inmate.  He's too dangerous to let him around the other inmates.",not spongebob,0
Why? What he'd do? Rob a bank?,not spongebob,0
Worse! He'd tried to steal the Krabby Patty formula.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh-kay.,not spongebob,0
"So that's why we keep him behind these impenetrable 6-inch steel doors.  Of course, it helps to lock it.  He's gone! He's so small, he could be anywhere!",not spongebob,0
"He could be right under our noses!  Umm… Frank, where's your mustache?",not spongebob,0
"Ha-ha! Those fools will never find me now!  Ah, come on, baby. You know how long I've been in stir.",not spongebob,0
Get out!  And stay out! You two time loser!,not spongebob,0
After everything I've done for you!,not spongebob,0
"BEAT IT, YOU JAIL BIRD, AND TAKE ALL OF YOUR JUNK, TOO!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's just great.  Hey! It's my old guitar. I used to play it when I was in that band as a kid. Man, those were good times.  Okay, everybody! One two… one two three!  You know, I don't think I've had any good times.",not spongebob,0
"♪Oh, I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah! A teaspoon of *raspberry*♪  ♪Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song.♪",spongebob,1
"He's singing about the Krabby Patty. If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!",not spongebob,0
♪Mix in some…♪,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
♪Nyah-Nyah-Nyah♪,spongebob,1
That's a real nice song.,not spongebob,0
♪Add a splash of wee…♪,spongebob,1
But could you explain those wee parts?,not spongebob,0
"♪And when I'm done, I chop up some… Love.♪",spongebob,1
"Gahh!  Are you out of your mind? Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Plankton.  Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's terrible. Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you! Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!",not spongebob,0
I know what you're doing!,spongebob,1
"What, me? I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!",not spongebob,0
You want me to… join your band!,spongebob,1
What band? I don't have a band.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!",spongebob,1
Songs?  Yes! And you could teach me your Krabby Patty songs!,not spongebob,0
"Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I've got big news!",spongebob,1
"Me, too! Me, too!",not spongebob,0
What's your news?,spongebob,1
I found out where boogers come from.,not spongebob,0
"Ew, really?",spongebob,1
Uh-huh. What's your news?,not spongebob,0
Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band!  Can Patrick join our band?,spongebob,1
"Sure, whatever.",not spongebob,0
"Hear that, Patrick? You're in.",spongebob,1
All right! I play a mean belly.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous!",spongebob,1
"Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward…",spongebob,1
What the…,not spongebob,0
Would you help us by joining our band?,spongebob,1
"Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes…  playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans…  clapping, demanding encores, cheering me…  Oh, uh, changed my mind. I'll join your band and help you bottom feeders…  But I gotta get in shape first!",not spongebob,0
"Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us!",spongebob,1
"Hmm? Uh, yeah, great.",not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this?",spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Well, with just a little more…",spongebob,1
"Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"You know, pizzazz!",spongebob,1
Perhaps you didn't notice… My new hairdo.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!",spongebob,1
"And unlike your nasty, little wig…  Mine is real!",not spongebob,0
"Man, how'd you grow that so fast?",spongebob,1
"Natural talent, watch this…",not spongebob,0
"Whoo, yeah!  Dig that fancy follicle work!",spongebob,1
"Hey, check this one out.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward. Aren't you coming to band practice?",spongebob,1
Are you kidding? I've got a lot of work to do before I'm famous!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, then, we'll keep your seat warm.  Patrick?",spongebob,1
I'm on it.,not spongebob,0
"Greetings, fellow band-mates.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton, what's that?",spongebob,1
T-shirts.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
Ah…  Plankton and the… Patty Stealers?,spongebob,1
"Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh…",not spongebob,0
I… LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious.,spongebob,1
Can I get mine in pink?  It looks like a tattoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this?  And then turn into one of those songs that goes…",spongebob,1
"Yes, perfect. Now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?",not spongebob,0
Or… One about my new friend Plankton?,spongebob,1
Stop it!,not spongebob,0
Or the ventures of wholesome…,spongebob,1
The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know…  Secret recipe.,not spongebob,0
I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this.,not spongebob,0
"Is that what you mean, Plankton?",spongebob,1
What is that?,spongebob,1
It's my… uh… recording equipment.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my gosh! What do I do?",spongebob,1
"Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in.  Now just relax and let the equipment do its job.  Now, let's see what's locked in his subconscious.",not spongebob,0
"♪Time to feed him. Time to feed him. Now it's Gary's feeding time. Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow.♪",spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"♪Brush, brush, brush my teeth. Gently keep them clean.♪",spongebob,1
The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere.  What's going-  I'm a failure.,not spongebob,0
"Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
At the Krusty Krab?,not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, but old man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there.",spongebob,1
When nobody's there?,not spongebob,0
My perfect dream-body.,not spongebob,0
One week later…,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!",not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
"Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me.",not spongebob,0
"Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what are you kids up to this late at night?",not spongebob,0
We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band.,spongebob,1
"A band, huh, well, that's, uh… Oh.  Uh, you've got a, uh…",not spongebob,0
"Got a, uh, what?",spongebob,1
Uh… It's right…,not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
"Just keep your nose clean, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, officer.  They're gone.",spongebob,1
"You will never speak of this to anyone.  Come on, come on, hurry up.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, I just need to get the key out.",spongebob,1
"Give me that, you incompetent fool.  Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula's mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time!  Now where does Krabs keep that formula?",not spongebob,0
"Whoo, let's rock!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
We're gonna be stars!,not spongebob,0
"All right! Squidward, are you ready?",spongebob,1
I'm ready!,not spongebob,0
"Okay! Patrick, are you ready?  Plankton, are you ready?  Plankton?  PLANKTON!",spongebob,1
Uh… I'm ready?,not spongebob,0
Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?,spongebob,1
"What? No, I was in it for the music, man!",not spongebob,0
"Well, at least I'm back to my old cell.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, you're not. We've got a special cell for you.",not spongebob,0
But I liked my old cell.,not spongebob,0
Then you're gonna love this one.,not spongebob,0
"There's no time to waste, Plankton.  We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two…",spongebob,1
"It is a cold and windy day, and Bikini Bottom is covered with goosebumps.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's freezing in here!",not spongebob,0
"Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. My buns are nice and toasty.",spongebob,1
"I'm so glad I don't eat here.  Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway?  62 degrees?! Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to set it to a toasty 63.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT?!?!?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thanks a--",not spongebob,0
"You're welcome, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.",not spongebob,0
Do not touch thermostat ever.,not spongebob,0
"Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!",not spongebob,0
That's totally selfish!,not spongebob,0
Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!,spongebob,1
"What?!  Hey, you kids get off of my lawn!",not spongebob,0
"That's right. Run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it with your precious thermostat!  What the--? Oh, no! Code red! Abandon ship!! Abandon ship!  No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge.",not spongebob,0
I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.,not spongebob,0
Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?,spongebob,1
It means he's a big fat crybaby.,not spongebob,0
Locked in again.,not spongebob,0
"That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place.  Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs! It's just business.  Well, maybe it is personal.  I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat!",not spongebob,0
Someone—touching—thermostat.,not spongebob,0
I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.,not spongebob,0
"That's why I wore mittens.  Mm, toasty!",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Morning, boys!  Lock's a bit sticky this morning.  Is it cold in here, or is it just me? Well, get to work.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!  Pardon me!",spongebob,1
"All right, quit clowning around and get to work.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
As long as you turn the heat up!,not spongebob,0
The temperature stays at 62 degrees.,not spongebob,0
There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!,not spongebob,0
I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones! Don't... touch... THE THERMOSTAT!,not spongebob,0
I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder.,not spongebob,0
Quit your lollygagging and get a move on!,not spongebob,0
Order up.,not spongebob,0
Let's get out of here.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, flee that frozen wasteland! Warmth and joy have left your lives!  Hey, buddy, you want to eat at The Chum Bucket?  Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back!  I don't understand! What's bringing them back?  What the--?!",not spongebob,0
Just put those patties back when you're done!,not spongebob,0
"Can do, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
I'm really glad I don't eat here.,not spongebob,0
Order up!,spongebob,1
Where's my food?  Mm.,not spongebob,0
I want my Krabby Flabby!,not spongebob,0
"Coming right up, sir!",spongebob,1
Delicious!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, that looks like fun. I'll have two Krabby Patties, but don't cook them.",not spongebob,0
"I'll have two frozen Krabby Patties, too.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
I want Patty skates!,not spongebob,0
"I need two patties, now!",not spongebob,0
"It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook 'em! This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life.",not spongebob,0
NOOOO!!! How is this possible?! I freeze his place solid and he turns it into an ice rink! He's making more money than ever!,not spongebob,0
"That's because, unlike you, he's a good businessman.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.",not spongebob,0
I don't understand why you don't just steal a Krabby Patty in all that confusion.,not spongebob,0
I'll be right back.,not spongebob,0
I don't know why I encourage him.,not spongebob,0
This is fantastic! The local hockey team is paying me to practice here!,not spongebob,0
"Coming through!  Hi, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Where'd the puck go?,not spongebob,0
Holy shrimp! Plankton!,spongebob,1
I did it! I finally got a Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
"Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me first.",spongebob,1
There's the puck! That little square guy has it!,not spongebob,0
Get him!,not spongebob,0
"You're mine now, Plankton!  You won't get away with this, Plankton!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my weekend was fabulous! Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug!  Swallowed a bug.",spongebob,1
"Fascinating. Well, got to go.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,spongebob,1
"Better luck next time, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"There's the puck, eh? Get it!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.  Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there, mister!",spongebob,1
Yes! I'm gonna make it!,not spongebob,0
"Gotcha, Plankton!",spongebob,1
On the contrary! It is I who has you!,not spongebob,0
The clamboni! Run for it!,spongebob,1
"Run, you fools! Run!  It's working! I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty!  Come on, get outta the way! You're blocking the exit!  Noooo! NOOOO!",not spongebob,0
"I'll take that.  Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"You lose again, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon!  The thermostat!",not spongebob,0
The thermostat?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab.  You see?",not spongebob,0
"You've gone too far this time, Plankton! You can pummel me employees,  try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat.",not spongebob,0
"See, Krabs? You can't defeat me!",not spongebob,0
"Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, lad.  Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab! Hey, you got any more good ideas?",not spongebob,0
"And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Maybe today will be the day?,not spongebob,0
"Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife.",not spongebob,0
Do you even have a plan?,not spongebob,0
"Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula...",not spongebob,0
"Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there.",spongebob,1
"Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure?",not spongebob,0
There really should be a Wet Floor sign.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.",not spongebob,0
Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?,not spongebob,0
Of course.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.",not spongebob,0
Sue?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that looks bad.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Poor little man.,not spongebob,0
"Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?",not spongebob,0
"Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.",not spongebob,0
Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!,not spongebob,0
"See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain!",not spongebob,0
I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.",spongebob,1
What I really need is a good lawyer.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, did somebody say lawyer?  Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.",not spongebob,0
"So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.",not spongebob,0
"In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.",not spongebob,0
Does that happen a lot?,not spongebob,0
"No, they're usually silver.",spongebob,1
"Um, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"What is it, lad?",not spongebob,0
I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.,spongebob,1
"Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.",not spongebob,0
But I...,spongebob,1
"Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk!",not spongebob,0
Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!,spongebob,1
Wracked...with pain...can't move.,not spongebob,0
But what about Mr. Krabs' case?,spongebob,1
"Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.",not spongebob,0
"But, I'm a...a liability.",spongebob,1
Everything you need to win...  is in this here case.,not spongebob,0
Really? Everything?,spongebob,1
Uh huh. Everything but a suit.,not spongebob,0
A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.,spongebob,1
I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.,not spongebob,0
"Never, you little runt!",not spongebob,0
"Oww, oww! My wittle arm!",not spongebob,0
What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.,not spongebob,0
Oww! My other arm!,not spongebob,0

I don't know where he could be.,not spongebob,0
Here I am!,spongebob,1
"Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.",spongebob,1
"What are you doing here, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  .",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Yep, right in here.",spongebob,1
Is there a problem?,not spongebob,0
Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.,spongebob,1
Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.",not spongebob,0
"Pull yourself together, boy.",not spongebob,0
Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
"How's it coming, lad?",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case.",spongebob,1
"Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.",not spongebob,0
Bombs away!,spongebob,1
Ahem! Are you quite finished?,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm.,spongebob,1
Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry!  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.,not spongebob,0
Does the defense...  have an opening statement?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?",not spongebob,0
It's a wet floor sign.,not spongebob,0
Do you own one?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.",not spongebob,0
"Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.",not spongebob,0
No more questions.,not spongebob,0
"Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Sometime today, Mr. Pants.",not spongebob,0
"May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender?",spongebob,1
"No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.",not spongebob,0
Does the defense have any witness to call?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.",spongebob,1
"Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee.",not spongebob,0
"Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?,spongebob,1
Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?,not spongebob,0
Must...open...case.,not spongebob,0
"So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?",spongebob,1
"Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?",spongebob,1
I'm doomed.,not spongebob,0
"You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open!",spongebob,1
It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it?,not spongebob,0
Defense calls Plankton to the stand.,spongebob,1
Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?,spongebob,1
"To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?",not spongebob,0
"Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...",spongebob,1
"Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!",not spongebob,0
I'll take that!,not spongebob,0
"Huh? No, no, no!",not spongebob,0
"Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no!",not spongebob,0
Has the jury reached a verdict?,not spongebob,0
"We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.",not spongebob,0
"That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.",spongebob,1
A present? For me?,not spongebob,0
Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a wet floor sign. I made it myself.,spongebob,1
"Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.",not spongebob,0
And...,spongebob,1

"You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate:  He wants a tip.",not spongebob,0
What's a tip?,spongebob,1
"It means he wants money for nothing.  So watch closely.  There ye are, lad.",not spongebob,0
"Wow. A quarter. You, sir, are a real cheapskate.",not spongebob,0
"Why, thank you!  Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back!",not spongebob,0
Oh. Like I haven't seen that gag ten times today.,not spongebob,0

"I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'...  Ye not getting it, are ye?  Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.",not spongebob,0
"You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?",not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
"Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win!",not spongebob,0
"Um, uh, uh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red.",spongebob,1

No! About me being cheap!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer.",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!",not spongebob,0
"Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees.  Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks.",spongebob,1

Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!,spongebob,1
"Heh heh. Well, could we exaggerate this pillow, too?",not spongebob,0
"Well, only if you help me exaggerate this air conditioner!",spongebob,1
"Sure, boy! But why not exaggerate the whole wall?  Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy.",not spongebob,0
Do you have any hotel property in this bag?,not spongebob,0

Can I make a Krabby Patty now?,spongebob,1
"Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph...  *ahem* graph.  You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night...  because the store closes at 6.  No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat.  But mostly his sweat.  From Humble Beginnings.  You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.  But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born!",not spongebob,0

"This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.",not spongebob,0
"All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it?  Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check.  But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder.  Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, Hello world! May I take your order? You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants. But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good.

"Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP.  Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.",not spongebob,0
I'd like to order-,not spongebob,0

One patty please.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, POOP! You never let us down!  Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Krabby Patty!,spongebob,1
"Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about:  Personal Hygiene.  Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines.  Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift?  A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails.  And don't forget about the knuckles.  And make sure those palms are squeaky clean.  All right, let's see those hands!  Now that's thorough, HAHA.  After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils,  and your hair is neat and tidy,  you are ready to start the day!

Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station.",not spongebob,0
Huh?  Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you.  Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty.  Calm down.

Fine! May I please take your order?,not spongebob,0
I'll have uhh... uhhhh...,not spongebob,0

"Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!",not spongebob,0

"Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?",spongebob,1
"Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...",not spongebob,0

One shady hat.,spongebob,1
"Good job, lad.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.",not spongebob,0
"Didn't need to buy one?  You hear that, boy?  We didn't need to buy a hat.  Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!",not spongebob,0
"I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!",not spongebob,0
A few moments later...,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat!,not spongebob,0
You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes!,not spongebob,0

SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...,not spongebob,0
"Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  Arrgh, SpongeBob! Yer spending all me money! And then I'll say, But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said! Then you'll say, We're not talking about this...  ...Or this...  ...we're talking about this!",spongebob,1
"But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this!",not spongebob,0
Are we going to the park soon?,not spongebob,0
"Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see?  Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.",spongebob,1
Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!,not spongebob,0
See?! You just did it again!,spongebob,1
"Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money.  Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think?  Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet!",spongebob,1
"I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs.  I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, okay.",not spongebob,0
"You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Aawww...,not spongebob,0
"So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So...",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
They weren't overcooked at all!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, look!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!,not spongebob,0
"Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request. Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.",not spongebob,0
Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?!,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,spongebob,1
Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?,not spongebob,0
Where are all the new hotel employees?,not spongebob,0
"My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.",not spongebob,0
"If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk.",not spongebob,0
"I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
"This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?",not spongebob,0
"Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!",not spongebob,0
Gimme that! Now sign the register.,not spongebob,0
I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!",not spongebob,0
Close enough. Here's your room key.,not spongebob,0
I'll need some help with my bags.,not spongebob,0
How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!,not spongebob,0
This is a hotel?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Take Patrick and his bags to his room.,not spongebob,0
What about my Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
And bring him a Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr Krabs!",not spongebob,0
What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.,not spongebob,0
"Fine. Let's go, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.,not spongebob,0
"What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?",not spongebob,0
I don't tell you how to live your life!,not spongebob,0
"Well, here's your room.",not spongebob,0
Wow.,not spongebob,0
Enjoy your stay.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.",not spongebob,0
"Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock.",spongebob,1
"Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man.",not spongebob,0
"Why, thank you, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!",not spongebob,0
What now?!,not spongebob,0
I don't like crusts on my sandwich!,not spongebob,0
It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?,not spongebob,0
Peel it.,not spongebob,0
Happy?,not spongebob,0
Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.,spongebob,1
Could you do one more thing for me?,not spongebob,0
Why don't you ask SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Good idea, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"How may I serve you, sir?",spongebob,1
I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, sir!",spongebob,1
Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.,not spongebob,0
What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?,not spongebob,0
"He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!",not spongebob,0
"He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs...",not spongebob,0
"Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.",not spongebob,0
A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.",not spongebob,0
That's it! I've had enough!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!",not spongebob,0
"Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!",not spongebob,0
Not anymore. I quit.,not spongebob,0
Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!,not spongebob,0
"One room, please. On the top floor.",not spongebob,0
What do you think you're doing?,not spongebob,0
I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.,not spongebob,0
I don't have to rent you a room!,not spongebob,0
I've got cash.,not spongebob,0
Oh... here's your room key.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, guest sir.",spongebob,1
And you can carry me to my room.,not spongebob,0
And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.,not spongebob,0
"The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.",not spongebob,0
"Your room, sir.",spongebob,1
"And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair.",not spongebob,0
You've got to be kidding me!,not spongebob,0
And I want it here in five seconds.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir.",spongebob,1
"Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm not going to eat this. You are.",not spongebob,0
What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!,not spongebob,0
"Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.",spongebob,1
"Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"What is it, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.,not spongebob,0
Here's your homemade cookies.,not spongebob,0
These don't taste anything like mom used to make!,not spongebob,0
"Well, how did your mother make 'em?",not spongebob,0
How should I know?! Ask my mother!,not spongebob,0
Hello?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"No good, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1

I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.,not spongebob,0
So you're all taken care of?,not spongebob,0
"Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request.  Perfect!,not spongebob,0
This room is exactly the same as when we started!,not spongebob,0
Nothing like getting back to the basics.,not spongebob,0
"Let's get out of here, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming.",not spongebob,0
The pool's out back!,not spongebob,0
"Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim.  Come on in, the water's fine.",not spongebob,0
Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?,not spongebob,0
"Nope, that's it.",not spongebob,0
You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm good.",not spongebob,0
"Me, too.",spongebob,1
"Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy!  Cannonball!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.",not spongebob,0
That was a hotel?,not spongebob,0
"Your bill, sir.",not spongebob,0
"$15,000?!",not spongebob,0
"You're not going to have a heart attack, are you?",not spongebob,0
Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!,not spongebob,0
This is a hospital?,not spongebob,0
"Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger,  and bigger, and— ow!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hey Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all.  Let's see what's inside.  Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite-sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!",spongebob,1
"A great fortune has fallen upon you.  Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future.  Happy trails will follow you always.  Your fortune came true too!",spongebob,1
Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one.",spongebob,1
No.  Way.,not spongebob,0
You will be rewarded for your particular talent. Right.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, Mr. Squidward Tentacles, you have just won the most miserable cashier in Bikini Bottom contest. Here is your cash prize!",not spongebob,0
"Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!",not spongebob,0
"Me cash register, me money.",not spongebob,0
And that's why my depression is award-winning.,not spongebob,0
"Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?",spongebob,1
"You know, you're right, SpongeBob.  We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me.",not spongebob,0
All right!,spongebob,1
Hooray.,not spongebob,0
"This is how you hook them!  Now remember, the first one is free!",not spongebob,0
"Something wonderful is about to happen to you.  I love puppies. Thanks, fortune cookie!",not spongebob,0
Eat your hat and you will fall in love.,not spongebob,0
Thanks  fortune cookie!,not spongebob,0
You will soon injure your legs?!  My legs! I was looking for an excuse to get out of jury duty.  Thanks fortune cookie!,not spongebob,0
Those fortune cookies are a hit.,spongebob,1
"Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese!",not spongebob,0
Sheldon! Where are you!?,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes?!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, your lordship, but the garbage isn't going to take itself out.",not spongebob,0
"Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?",not spongebob,0
Our marriage?,not spongebob,0
No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So...,not spongebob,0
"So, you got an evil plan to get the Krabby Patty secret formula and soon it will be yours, all yours.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic.",not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
"This will be a good one,  You stink.",not spongebob,0
"Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Time for a refill.,spongebob,1
What is my future?,not spongebob,0
"My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register.  Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Let the wave of misfortune begin.,not spongebob,0
You will get stomach cramps from the Krusty Krab?!,not spongebob,0
The octopus with the big nose just spit in your food?!,not spongebob,0
A yellow sponge will serve you salmonella?!,not spongebob,0
You will live forever if you eat at the Chum Bucket?!,not spongebob,0
Let's eat at the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?,not spongebob,0
"Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before.  Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck.",spongebob,1
"Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!",not spongebob,0
Hello!  Did someone say copepod?,not spongebob,0
"Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease, Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!",not spongebob,0
"J-just how true are these cookie fortunes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true!",spongebob,1
You will die.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll miss you, daddy!  But I really can't wait to spend your hard-earned money on shoes!",not spongebob,0
Me money!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! No!,spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, it's time.  It's time to give up the secret formula to Plankton!  Because your life is worth more than some scrap of paper in a bottle.",spongebob,1
"You're right, me boy-o,  I've got to face me fortune.",not spongebob,0
"Don't crowd, there's more Chumbalaya where that came from, unfortunately.",not spongebob,0
It's worth it to live forever.,not spongebob,0
"The scheme is working perfectly,  and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula.  I promised myself I wouldn't cry.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this crowd is impossible!",not spongebob,0
"Leave it to me, Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours.  Hot stuff comin' through!",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, secret formula, I'm comin', baby!",not spongebob,0
Me want that papa!,not spongebob,0
"Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this.",spongebob,1
"Finally!  No!  Ah-hah.  I have had enough!  Get out of my restaurant, you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes,  they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you, out!",not spongebob,0
Let's go back to the Krusty Krab!,not spongebob,0
I guess I didn't really think that through.,not spongebob,0
"I figured the funeral fortune was phony, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah?! What are you going to do about it, Eugene?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing, Sheldon.  Here, have a fortune cookie.",not spongebob,0
Eh. You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve.  Hey!,not spongebob,0
Ahh! Hey!  Ooh! Mommy!,not spongebob,0
"What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!",not spongebob,0
"Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.",not spongebob,0
Awwww!,not spongebob,0
"Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!",not spongebob,0
For the price of a lifetime membership!,not spongebob,0
Awww!,not spongebob,0
But today everything is free!,not spongebob,0
Shape us and mold us in your image!,not spongebob,0
"You're the lobster, Larry! The Alpha Lobster!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know if I'll say that!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I filled out a membership form!",not spongebob,0
Me too!,not spongebob,0
What's in that pink box?,not spongebob,0
"Um, donuts sir?",not spongebob,0
"Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!",not spongebob,0
Is it true that everything is free?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, sir! For your first visit we-",not spongebob,0
"Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, I've got my work cut out for me.",not spongebob,0
The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.,not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
Here!,not spongebob,0
"Aah! Thanks, Larry!",spongebob,1
"Uh, what are you doing?",not spongebob,0
You said everything was free.,not spongebob,0
"No, no. Your first visit is free.",not spongebob,0
"So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!",not spongebob,0
Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.,not spongebob,0
I didn't think there'd be so much of it.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?",spongebob,1
Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule.  Always be hydrating.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?",spongebob,1
"Sure!  What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?",not spongebob,0
Squishy.,spongebob,1
What I'm saying is I can make you a man.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,spongebob,1
"I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership.",not spongebob,0
I'm ready!,spongebob,1
That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
And remember: always be hydrating!,not spongebob,0
"Ok, I will!",spongebob,1
"That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later.",not spongebob,0
"Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers.  Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, Beautiful Angel. That's normal, right?",spongebob,1
"It's Larry, King of the Gym!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!",not spongebob,0
Polish this crown for me. Will you?,not spongebob,0
"Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these...  really heavy... pieces of metal for free!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Free!,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.",spongebob,1
Flashback...,not spongebob,0
End of flashback...,not spongebob,0
Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.,not spongebob,0
"Here we go. Cotton swabs.  Cotton balls.  Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.",not spongebob,0
How am I doing?,spongebob,1
Pathetic.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.",not spongebob,0
"First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.",not spongebob,0
I'll be there!,spongebob,1
That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!,not spongebob,0
"The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle!  Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches!  Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh.  Only now, I'll do it on my back.",spongebob,1
Could you do it without the laugh?,not spongebob,0
"I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not.",spongebob,1
Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...,not spongebob,0
Always be hydrating.,spongebob,1
Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.,not spongebob,0
Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!,not spongebob,0
Do you have to do that in front of me?,not spongebob,0
Yes! Yes I do!  Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!,not spongebob,0
Nice potbelly!,not spongebob,0
Potbelly?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.",not spongebob,0
Oh my Neptune!,not spongebob,0
Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!,spongebob,1
My legs!  I'm ok!  Slightly less ok!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,spongebob,1
What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!,not spongebob,0
Larry?,spongebob,1
"Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.",spongebob,1
"With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, tell me the truth.  Do I have a potbelly?",not spongebob,0
"No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.",spongebob,1
See you in exercise class. I guess.,not spongebob,0
Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.",spongebob,1
"I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back.",spongebob,1
Walk on your back.,spongebob,1
And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.,spongebob,1
"I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's the use.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, who am I kidding!",not spongebob,0
"You wanted to see me, sir?",spongebob,1
"Yeah.  Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.",not spongebob,0
"I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...",spongebob,1
"I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob.  You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.",not spongebob,0
This sounds great.,spongebob,1
"Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!",spongebob,1
Come over here and give me a bro-hug!,not spongebob,0
You mean a br-ug?,spongebob,1
I don't wanna call it that.,not spongebob,0
"Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!",spongebob,1
"Whoa, what happened?",spongebob,1
"Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!",not spongebob,0
"Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!",spongebob,1
Don't say br-ug.,not spongebob,0
Br-ug.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed!  You're a pretty good instructor after all.  Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.",not spongebob,0
The very next evening...,not spongebob,0
"Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what a great day.",spongebob,1
And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  What is that smell?  Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!",not spongebob,0
I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?,not spongebob,0
"Just go! Oh, no.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I will have a quad patty, with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt, smoked paprika, and micro greens.",not spongebob,0
Gimme a quad—,not spongebob,0
Hold on. I'm not finished with my order.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, come on!",not spongebob,0
"I would like my patties be-cheesed, but not just any cheese will do. Have you any aged gouda?  And yes, it is pronounced how-uda, not goo-da.",not spongebob,0
Just eat the regular Krabby Patty  and stop wasting everybody's time!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that.  It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual.  The customer is always right, when they have money.",spongebob,1
"Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Ketchup waster!  Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise.",not spongebob,0
Your napkin.,not spongebob,0
Waster!,not spongebob,0
Hmm?  Ow! Mr. Krabs!  You gotta calm down!,spongebob,1
Oh!  I'll murder-lize him!,not spongebob,0
"Relax, little crab guy.",not spongebob,0
Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get...,not spongebob,0
That's right. Give in to the healing power of my pecs.,not spongebob,0
I feel so secure.,spongebob,1
All better?,not spongebob,0
What? You let him go? We're all dead!  Ow! The grill's still on!,not spongebob,0
I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break.,not spongebob,0
Sounds like someone needs a vacation.,not spongebob,0
I—I could use some me time.,not spongebob,0
And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.,spongebob,1
Hmm...,not spongebob,0
Order up!,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?",not spongebob,0
"Psst, psst!",spongebob,1
"That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?",not spongebob,0
Larry's got his own gym to run.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Larry. It'll be fun.",spongebob,1
Larry loves fun! I'm in.,not spongebob,0
All right! Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?",spongebob,1
Larry likes it just fine. But do the customers always eat like this?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. They normally eat like this!",spongebob,1
Those poor people. Someone needs to whip them into shape.,not spongebob,0
What'll you have?,not spongebob,0
"Uh...I'll have a double Krabby Patty, Krabby fries, and uh—whoa!",not spongebob,0
What else?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, uh—a Krabby soda...Uh, uh—a Krabby... My leg!",not spongebob,0
Hey!  Can I help you?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'll take a Krabby salad, dressing on the side, and 60 more minutes on this rad treadmill.",not spongebob,0
Here's your change.,not spongebob,0
"Here's your order, sir.  And don't forget your side salad!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Push it, push it!",not spongebob,0
"Push it, push it!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay. I'll push it.",not spongebob,0
"Push it, push it!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, push it!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!",spongebob,1
Hooray...,not spongebob,0
"Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
"Ah, forget Krabby Patties. Those things are over.",not spongebob,0
"But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, not anymore. Now we only serve salads and protein power shakes!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste.",spongebob,1
You like?,not spongebob,0
"No, Larry. No.",spongebob,1
But it gets you jacked!,not spongebob,0
I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.,spongebob,1
Everybody wants to get jacked.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, jacked!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the...",spongebob,1
Larry?,spongebob,1
Jacked.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! Squidward! Let's move it, boys. Get those power shakes out and those heart rates up!",not spongebob,0
Sorry!,spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Horrible sustenance.,not spongebob,0
Let's get outta here!,not spongebob,0
Pardon my reach.,spongebob,1
"Go on without me!  No, wait, don't.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym.",spongebob,1
Feel...the...burn!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired.",spongebob,1
"Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place.  And I know just where to start: the power shakes.",not spongebob,0
I'm on it!,spongebob,1
"Wait, wait—what about me?",not spongebob,0
Butter!  Lard!  Mayonnaise.,spongebob,1
"And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise!  Here you go.",spongebob,1
"I'm loving this oily concoction. It really makes Larry's muscles pop!  Thanks, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, that failed. What now?",spongebob,1
We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!,not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,spongebob,1
"Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here.",not spongebob,0
"Awesome workout, bro!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now.",spongebob,1
"Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?",not spongebob,0
Help us!  Hungry!,not spongebob,0
What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.,spongebob,1
"We can't go home. There's no Krabby Patties at home. I need my Krabby Patties, man!  You gotta help me!",not spongebob,0
Help us! Help! Help!,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you're ruining Larry's pump sesh.",not spongebob,0
"Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
"Get 'em, men!",not spongebob,0
Fire!,spongebob,1
Mmm!,not spongebob,0
"Get over here!  Mmm. Oh, gimme, gimme!",not spongebob,0
Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Give into the flavor, Larry!",spongebob,1
Never!,not spongebob,0
"He's too fast. We need a distraction.  Here, use this.",spongebob,1
"No, you gotta keep your elbow— Oh! Greasy, fatty, sticky, and gummy! It's delicious! Larry's been a fool. I've spent all my time working on my muscles when I could've been working on these delicious sandwiches.  What's—what's wrong with me?",not spongebob,0
Now those are some sad pecs.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape.  Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers.",spongebob,1
Somebody let me out of this thing already!,not spongebob,0
Home sweet home.  Hmm?,not spongebob,0
Order up!,spongebob,1
Everything's just how I left it.,not spongebob,0
"Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur.",spongebob,1
It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!,not spongebob,0
"Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef.  For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love.  Enjoy your meal!  It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, you really touched his life.",not spongebob,0
Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.,spongebob,1
Quality food?,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
Good people?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
Discriminating tastes?,not spongebob,0
Testify!,spongebob,1
D'oh!  Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect.  There, there.  Mr. Krabs will be ashamed!",spongebob,1
"All right, you filthy bilge rats!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way!",not spongebob,0
"What's happening, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!",not spongebob,0
Fancy? Froufrou?,not spongebob,0
We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof!,not spongebob,0
Chef exchange program?,spongebob,1
"Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes!  Heh, looks like it's early.",not spongebob,0
It was that easy? All these years?  I've underestimated the power of public transportation!,not spongebob,0
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
Does your middle name happen to be No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here?,not spongebob,0
"I find you disgusting.  However, my culture dictates zat I must kiss you regardless.",not spongebob,0
"Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.",not spongebob,0
But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction!,not spongebob,0
What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this!  Start over! And this  I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping!  Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done!  And where is my exchange chef?!,not spongebob,0
"Um, right here, sir.",spongebob,1
"There you are. Bonjour!  Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish!  This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian!  Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than...  Just warming up.  Come on, SpongeBob!  Just one egg then...  No, that's not it, no...",spongebob,1
You are making a mockery of my...  This taste is fantastic! What do you call it?,not spongebob,0
A Krabby Patty.,spongebob,1
The whole world must taste this!,not spongebob,0
"Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, look at this!  We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy.",not spongebob,0
Oh! What is that?!,not spongebob,0
I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.,not spongebob,0
"Wrong, monsieur! It is ze Rare Fruit of ze Kazook Tree.",not spongebob,0
So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?,not spongebob,0
Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold.,not spongebob,0
Shredded...  gold?  Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?,not spongebob,0
"Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like zis. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients, and eaten with only the finest silverware, while sitting on the finest furniture!  Zis... is not ze chair I ordered...",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.",not spongebob,0
"And zis fork of plastic... Spray painted to look silver, is it not?  I cannot prepare food UNDER ZESE CONDITIONS!",not spongebob,0
"Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine!  I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and...",not spongebob,0
"Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again!",spongebob,1
"I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab!  So long!",spongebob,1
"Wait, just one more?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, but I've got to go.",spongebob,1
I'm ruined! Busted!  Hello?,not spongebob,0
"Daddy, the house is full of burglars.",not spongebob,0
"No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.",not spongebob,0
You sold me?!?,not spongebob,0
"No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, mac!",not spongebob,0
You're pathetic!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.",not spongebob,0
Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my eats and I are leaving.  This is for you.,not spongebob,0
Is it money?,not spongebob,0
It is the bill for my services.,not spongebob,0
"One side, please.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Kra-a-abs?!,spongebob,1
"Okay, now I'm scared.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
Darn his cursed mocking voice! I...  SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore.... Customer #2 says: Please, Krabby Patties.... Customer #3 says: Krabby Patties, please.. Customer #4 says: Krabby Patties...]",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientèle back, and rich disgusting new clientèle to boot!  I'm back in business!",not spongebob,0
Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey, get back you, eat your own.  Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
Wow! It's the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show!,not spongebob,0
"It's cartoon time, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SpongeRobert?",not spongebob,0
Oh! It's cartoon time! I'll get our Sir Urchin hats.  Whoa.,spongebob,1
"Not so fast, SpongeBob. What's in the secret room?",not spongebob,0
"It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library.",spongebob,1
W-what's that word mean?,not spongebob,0
A library is a...playground for your mind.,spongebob,1
Let's do it! It's library time!,not spongebob,0
Ow! Ow!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I love books!  Book! Book!  Book!",not spongebob,0
"Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly.  Ow!  Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell.",spongebob,1
Whoa.,not spongebob,0
"Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous.",spongebob,1
I'll save you!  Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"There are logbooks,  unabridged books,  and books with bridges.",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks.  I can hear the ocean.,spongebob,1
Me too!,not spongebob,0
"Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious.",spongebob,1
I like the pictures.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack!  It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book.  Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, read the—oh, uh...Once...Upon a... Once upon a... Once upon a what?!",not spongebob,0
"To continue the story, you have to turn the page.",spongebob,1
Oh. Time. Once upon a time!  That's the most amazing trick I've ever seen! I want to stare at more words!,not spongebob,0
Then feast your eyes!,spongebob,1
Once upon a time...,not spongebob,0
Once a— You're too slow!,not spongebob,0
"He likes it! Hey, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Ooh, Patrick, your head is absorbing all the book knowledge just like a sponge!",spongebob,1
"Go, Patrick! Get those words! Get them good!",spongebob,1
Stop reading words!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, what a bookworm!  Whoa.",spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full.",spongebob,1
"Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information.  Ahem.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.",spongebob,1
"Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!",spongebob,1
"Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?",not spongebob,0
"Eh, wha what?",spongebob,1
"Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first.",not spongebob,0
I got it.,spongebob,1
Careful.,not spongebob,0
"Little bit...  Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?",spongebob,1
"Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my melon, as you so drolly put it, to slip out.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, sure. Let's give it a try.  Gary! Speak to me. Oh...  Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere.  Slime! That's it!  Slime it up, Gar-bear.",spongebob,1
Abominable!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out.",spongebob,1
Hey. Head Shrinking for Beginners.  Hm...,spongebob,1
"Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck...",not spongebob,0
You'll need to dumb down to get free!,spongebob,1
"Who's sporting the big brain now, hm?",not spongebob,0
"All right, Patrick! Let's get stupid! Yeah!",spongebob,1
Electronics.,spongebob,1
Whew. I hope this works.,spongebob,1
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least...",not spongebob,0
"We've got drool! Patrick, it's working!",spongebob,1
What I do?,not spongebob,0
This is insulting my intelligence.  And I adore it!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
Why you...!,not spongebob,0
What I do?,not spongebob,0
"We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!",spongebob,1
"Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella.",spongebob,1
Huh? Ah.,not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?",spongebob,1
"Boy, am I ever!  A book? I love books!  A book!  A book!",not spongebob,0
"That's right, Patrick.  Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh?",spongebob,1
"And now, back to Crustacean Crime Theater.",not spongebob,0
Stop! Thief!,not spongebob,0
Which way did he go?,not spongebob,0
He went that way!,not spongebob,0
"Let's get 'em, boys!",not spongebob,0
Curses! Foiled again!,not spongebob,0
What a no-good eel-in-the-kelp that guy was!  There ain't nothing worse than a thief! Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?",spongebob,1
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
"Like that barrel.  It says, Property of Salty Sea Farms.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.",not spongebob,0
"Are you renting the barrel, too?",spongebob,1
"Well, no.",not spongebob,0
Then you bought it?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Then, isn't that stealing?",spongebob,1
"Well, I, uh...",not spongebob,0
What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?,not spongebob,0
Um... Well..,not spongebob,0
And this Bikini Bell phone.,spongebob,1
"Well, uh, it's",not spongebob,0
And Sandy's hedge clippers.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, they're...",not spongebob,0
...And Plankton's lawn mower.,spongebob,1
"Well, he...",not spongebob,0
Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers.,spongebob,1
"That one was a gift!  Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.",not spongebob,0
"Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without  permission.",spongebob,1
"Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back  before it's missed.  Everyone knows that! Right?",not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
"All right then!  Hugs?  You put in  a hard day's work, boys!",not spongebob,0
But I don't work here!,not spongebob,0
"See you later! Oh, that was a close one.",not spongebob,0
What do you want to do today?,spongebob,1
I don't know. What do you want to do today?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. What do you want to do today?,spongebob,1
I don't know. What do you want to do today?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. What do you want to do today?,spongebob,1
"I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY.  I need some money.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh...   I don't have any money.  SpongeBob, I want a balloon really, really badly!  Really, really badly!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Patrick.  There's lots of money in the First National Bank of SpongeBob.  Follow me!  Uh-oh. I'm broke, too.  Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No, wait!  Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"It's just borrowing, right?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right?",spongebob,1
Right!,not spongebob,0
This is so great!,not spongebob,0
We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon!,spongebob,1
"Yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon!",not spongebob,0
Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop!,spongebob,1
"And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!",not spongebob,0
And the candy shop!,spongebob,1
And then my backyard!,not spongebob,0
And in a plane!,spongebob,1
And over a rock!,not spongebob,0
And under a hill!,spongebob,1
And with a whale!,not spongebob,0
WE LOVE BORROWING!!!,not spongebob,0
It popped...,spongebob,1
"How are we going to return it now, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I got the pieces!,spongebob,1
I got the air!,not spongebob,0
"Hurry, put the pieces on!  We popped the balloon!",spongebob,1
Ga-heh!,not spongebob,0
We can't return it!,spongebob,1
Wha-guh!,not spongebob,0
We're thieves!,spongebob,1
Hi-yo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
We have to confess.,spongebob,1
"Confess? Are you outta your mind? Do you have any idea what they do to people like us? We're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here,   WE STOLE A BALLOON!   And they're going to lock us up forever.",not spongebob,0
"You're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal.",spongebob,1
"Wow, street performers!",not spongebob,0
It's not working! Aaahhh!!,not spongebob,0
Hi there!,not spongebob,0
Hey! Don't you want a free balloon? It's National Free Balloon Day!,not spongebob,0
He's onto us!,not spongebob,0
It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks.,spongebob,1
"I'm on it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back.,spongebob,1
"Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs.,spongebob,1
Yup.,not spongebob,0
We're going to have to travel lighter.,spongebob,1
I want to go home.,not spongebob,0
"We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men.  We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warm around the fire.",spongebob,1
"Hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a...?",not spongebob,0
"I'm scared, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"No more nice, warm beds.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
No more Krabby Patties.,spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
No more getting mail!  No more Gary!   No more movies!  No more Squidward!   No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs!   No more anything!,spongebob,1
I want ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean... at least we have each other.",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"And all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right?",spongebob,1
Ja! Buns und t'ighs.,not spongebob,0
"And the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it?!",not spongebob,0
Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun!  We can loosen our ties!,spongebob,1
YEAH!  And we can fly!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!!  AAAAAAHHHHH!  Okay... we still can't do that!   But we don't have to shave...,spongebob,1
"I'm way ahead of you, buddy!",not spongebob,0
And you get to talk tough!   This town ain't big enough for the two of us.,spongebob,1
"Uh, let me try:  Uh...hey, punk.",not spongebob,0
"And the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
And we owe it all to  you.,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm nothing but a lot of talk! You're the one with the sticky fingers.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, Patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever!",spongebob,1
"You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though.",not spongebob,0
Look what I've got!,spongebob,1
Rectangles!,not spongebob,0
Not just any rectangles.  Candy bars!,spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives!,spongebob,1
Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Huh?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it.,not spongebob,0
"You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face.",spongebob,1
Where'd it go? I'm gonna starve.  Where'd it go?,not spongebob,0
I can't find it!  Where could it possibly be?  Aha!,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You stole my candy bar.,not spongebob,0
"No, I didn't.",spongebob,1
"Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Once a thief, always a thief.",not spongebob,0
"You ate yours,  this is mine.",spongebob,1
You took my only food.  Now I'm gonna starve!,not spongebob,0
"Here Patrick, just take half of mine.",spongebob,1
Yours?! You mean mine!,not spongebob,0
Do you want it or what?!,spongebob,1
I don't want it unless you admit you took it!,not spongebob,0
This is my candy bar!,spongebob,1
"LIAR, LIAR, PLANTS FOR HIRE!",not spongebob,0
"...it's pants on fire, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Well, you would know... liar.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself!",spongebob,1
You better not.    I'm warning you!,not spongebob,0
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah...,spongebob,1
Don't!   STOP IT!  Don't!  Oh!,not spongebob,0
Ahhhhhhh!  Noooo!   You're a crazy person. I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon.,not spongebob,0
"Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's it.  First the balloon, now my candy bar. You're out of control. I'm...  I'm telling on you!",not spongebob,0
Not if I tell on you first!,spongebob,1
I'll beat you there!,not spongebob,0
You're going to get in trouble!,spongebob,1
No! You are!!,not spongebob,0
He! When! Him!  And the balloon! And the boom! I...,not spongebob,0
"What can I do for you, boys?",not spongebob,0
WE STOLE A BALLOON!!!,not spongebob,0
I'm not good!,not spongebob,0
We stole a balloon!,spongebob,1
What's the problem here?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it appears these two stole a balloon.",not spongebob,0
What are you going to do to us?,spongebob,1
"Okay, follow me.   If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.  Okay, time's up.  Now, get out!",not spongebob,0
But...But...we stole a balloon.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, on Free Balloon Day!",not spongebob,0
Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again.,spongebob,1
You said it!  All right! Which one of you flat-floots stole my lollipop?   I mean it.,not spongebob,0
"Now, SpongeBob, what is the proper procedure for making a right turn?",not spongebob,0
"Hold on, I'll check the textbook.  Ah, Your Mirror and You. Hmm, proper seat belt hygiene? No.",spongebob,1
Assuming crash position.,not spongebob,0
We didn't crash!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,spongebob,1
"Mrs. Puff! Oh, there you are.  I'll make it up to you, Mrs. Puff. I'll shine your shoes!  Dry your hair!  Oil your boat?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, stop it! ENOUGH!  Well, you could clean up all this junk. I've been tossing stuff in this old lighthouse for 20 years!",not spongebob,0
I love cleaning!,spongebob,1
"Uh-huh, glad to hear it. I'll be in my classroom.  Oh, and if you need me...  ...don't.",not spongebob,0
That takes care of that.  Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.,spongebob,1
"Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern.  The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster.",spongebob,1
That box is haunted!  These stairs are haunted!  This trash is haunted.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Ahh! Ghost snail!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow!",not spongebob,0
"Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans.",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow.  Meow.",not spongebob,0
"Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety.  What! Louie?  Well, that oughta keep you out of my HAIR!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside.  No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain!   And the bait: one can-o-patty.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Gotcha!  I don't gotcha.  You got me.  Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh?  Huh, where'd Louie go?  Louie! Louie! Louie!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Louie! So this is where you've been hiding?  Nice snail, good Louie!  No, no...",spongebob,1
"Woah, those dudes are huge! I wonder what they lift.",not spongebob,0
Those aren't dudes. They're giant monsters! Everybody panic!,not spongebob,0
Those buff monsters have vanished!  We're saved!,not spongebob,0
We're doomed!  My cheeks!,not spongebob,0
Can you please tell our viewers the cause of this destruction?,not spongebob,0
"It was a lighthouse. It rolled through town, destroying everything in its path!  A LIGHTHOUSE!",not spongebob,0
My goodness. Were you or YOUR LEGS injured by this insane lighthouse?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
That blasted lighthouse is gonna demolish me Krusty Krab!  Attention loyal customers!,not spongebob,0
Run for our lives?,not spongebob,0
"No, throw your bodies in front of that lighthouse, and protect me restaurant!",not spongebob,0
"No, not the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
"Stay away from me restaurant, you dirty... er... lighthouse!",not spongebob,0
Must... stop... lighthouse.,spongebob,1
"Ha-ha, and don't come back!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you came back.",not spongebob,0
"Louie? Where's Louie?  Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning!  You were just protecting your cute little babies.  I guess I should call you Louise instead!",spongebob,1
"You actually did a good job, SpongeBob! You deserve a gold star!",not spongebob,0
"Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff.  These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse.",spongebob,1
Aren't you adorable?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!",spongebob,1
"See you next week, Mrs. Puff!",spongebob,1
"Amazing. For once, SpongeBob didn't create a huge disaster!",not spongebob,0
Puff! Your blasted lighthouse destroyed the whole town!  And me restaurant!,not spongebob,0
My lighthouse?!,not spongebob,0
What are you going to do about it?!,not spongebob,0
Talk to the fin!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm still here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty.",not spongebob,0
Do you work here?,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the!  Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you?! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties.  SpongeBob!  Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers.",not spongebob,0
I got it.,spongebob,1
"Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there?  An old book?",not spongebob,0
Nothing.,spongebob,1
What's going on here?,not spongebob,0
Thank you!,not spongebob,0
Excuse me. I wanted pickles on mine.,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm.  If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it.",not spongebob,0
"I'll take that, thank you.",spongebob,1
"There he goes again, scribbling away in that little book.  I must admit, my curiosity is peaked... I guess I'm peaked to peek at that book.  Oh, puns.",not spongebob,0
Ha.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, you need to make a delivery.",not spongebob,0
Okie-dokie!,spongebob,1
The address is on the bag.,not spongebob,0
I got it.,spongebob,1
"It's a diary! Oh-ho-ho. This is gonna be good. Huh? Drat, it's locked.  Hmm. I need a hairpin.  And now... the diary of a moron.",not spongebob,0
"Dear diary, what an amazing day I've...  ...day I've had.  This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward.  He had some very important news he was just bursting to share.  He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet.  Specifically, what not to feed them.  The list was very thorough.  Needless to say, this is all very enlightening.  It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique--  Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are.  Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short.  And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year,  cleaning day!  Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab,  and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots.  Ah yes, cleaning day.",spongebob,1
"Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right.  Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy!  A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been.  Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, uh, one of the customers dropped his watch in a toilet, and I need you to fish it out.",not spongebob,0
Duty calls.,spongebob,1
You laughing at me?,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious.",not spongebob,0
Reading somebody else's diary—that's terrible! Tell me more!,not spongebob,0
"It says here, when SpongeBob sees plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken.",not spongebob,0
Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast.  I just got me new kilt today.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?",not spongebob,0
I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--,spongebob,1
I fell in.,not spongebob,0
And that guy.,spongebob,1
What do you think of Mr. Krabs' new plaid kilt?,not spongebob,0
P-p-p-p-plaid?,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you don't have to be nasty about it!",not spongebob,0
"Avert your eyes, SquarePants.  I have to take my break!",spongebob,1
Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula Fifi.,not spongebob,0
He named his spatula Fifi.,not spongebob,0
He named his spatula Fifi.  What kind of name is Fifi?,not spongebob,0
"Who ever heard of naming a spatula Fifi? It's a girl's name! Right, Frank?",not spongebob,0
"I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, cook me up a Krabby Patty... with good old Fifi.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure thing.  Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, this is the best one yet. Get this: If I hear the Bikini Bottom Municipal Anthem, I can't help but take off all my clothes and dance around in my underwear!  Quiet, quiet, quiet. Watch this.",not spongebob,0
My... Diary! Squidward! How could you?!,spongebob,1
That was that little dude's diary?,not spongebob,0
That is not okay. That was uncool.,not spongebob,0
"That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize.",not spongebob,0
He'll get over it.,not spongebob,0
"Extra, extra, read all about it! Jerk reads the diary, local fry cook devastated.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm.  Taxi!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, pal. You're that diary reader.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I am.",not spongebob,0
Diary thief!,not spongebob,0
Jerk!,not spongebob,0
Secret stealer!,not spongebob,0
"Billy, stay away from that mean, old diary reader.",not spongebob,0
Morons.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward Tentacles, by reading another person's diary, you have violated the terms of your loan.  We are repossessing your house.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Take it away, boys!",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't sleep here, fella.  Wait a second, you're that diary reader! I had a diary once. My brother read it! I had a brother once! Come on, fella! We have a special place for people like you!",not spongebob,0
Diary reader!,not spongebob,0
"What!? You read it, too!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure, blame everyone but yourself. Oh, that is so you.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward. How's it going?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me.",not spongebob,0
What for?,spongebob,1
For reading your diary.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you.  Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary.  Now, that would have been really embarrassing.",spongebob,1
There he is! That diary reader!  Let's get him!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah, did you know he's reading your personal diary?",not spongebob,0
Squidward! How could you?!,spongebob,1
I don't care. This is so worth it!,not spongebob,0
Hmm.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Where are those patties?,not spongebob,0
"Coming right...down, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"What are you talking about, SpongeBob? Don't you mean coming right up?",not spongebob,0
Mmm...,spongebob,1
I don't see what you're—,not spongebob,0
"Nice catch, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Thanks...,not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
I want my teddy fish!,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, all right, don't worry, little boy, we'll find it!  This kid lost his toy. SpongeBob, I need you to check the Lost and Found.",not spongebob,0
Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found.,spongebob,1
I love my teddy fish!,not spongebob,0
"You better find it quick, SpongeBob. The kid's bawlin' is chasing me customers away. Follow me, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
Is there a ladder?,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Here's the ladder, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I—",spongebob,1
Nice catch!,not spongebob,0
Ow!,spongebob,1
"Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
"Oh, nothing, nothing. Good luck!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this must be the Lost and Found!  It's not in here!",spongebob,1
Try turning on the lights!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost cool guy shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side?",spongebob,1
What a funny echo. Ha...ha.,spongebob,1
Hey!  There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws!  I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow!  I love lost novelty items!  Ooh!,spongebob,1
Excuse me! Oh!,spongebob,1
Ah!,spongebob,1
"Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps!  What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom.",spongebob,1
Whew!  Whoa!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, you know that crying kids?",not spongebob,0
He's still crying...and it's still annoying!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm glad you're here. I think SpongeBob may be lost in the Lost and Found.",not spongebob,0
"And this concerns me how, exactly?  Wait—what?!",not spongebob,0
Don't worry. There's a ladder.,not spongebob,0
And find that toy...pronto!,not spongebob,0
Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?,spongebob,1
"No. We were the children, lost in the Krusty Krab over 60 years ago, and we were never claimed.",not spongebob,0
Did you drop a box on my head?,spongebob,1
Of course! It's how we say hello.,not spongebob,0
Oh!  Hello!,spongebob,1
Hello.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too.",spongebob,1
Don't worry. You are found and can live with us now.,not spongebob,0
How did you survive down here all this time?,spongebob,1
People leave all kinds of things behind. Like gum. And mints. They leave lots of mints.,not spongebob,0
Your breath is delightfully fresh.,spongebob,1
Bring on the welcoming feast!,not spongebob,0
Welcoming feast!,not spongebob,0
Dig in!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, little dolly. You must be getting hungry!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!",spongebob,1
"Grr! This? I found it, so...finders keepers.",not spongebob,0
Finders keepers. Finders keepers.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Yoink! Losers weepers!,spongebob,1
He is using our sacred words against us!,not spongebob,0
That's my teddy fish! Get him!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!",spongebob,1
Run...like the wind...,not spongebob,0
"Moron! I mean, SpongeBoooob?! I can't believe Old Man Krabs has held on to all this stuff.  Oooh! Kazoos! Why, I had a kazoo when I was a child...",not spongebob,0
Everybody loved it!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Ow! My ears!,not spongebob,0
"These are clarinets! In fact, these are all my clarinets! Wait a minute—these weren't lost! They were all in my locker! Mmm..  Now what could that possibly—",not spongebob,0
Typical.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward? SpongeBob? It's the curse of the Lost and Found: no one ever gets found. They just stay lost.  Oh, well, back to work.",not spongebob,0
Waaah!,not spongebob,0
The ambiance in this place stinks!,not spongebob,0
"Stinky ambiance? Oooh, it's a dark time for the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
Waaaah!,not spongebob,0
Waaaaah!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Lost toys!,spongebob,1
Get him!,not spongebob,0
Lost Toilets?,spongebob,1
We need more speed!,not spongebob,0
Lost Pets!,spongebob,1
Hyah! Hyah! Mush! Mush!,not spongebob,0
Lost Mine!,spongebob,1
Lost world!,spongebob,1
A hatch! Maybe that's the emergency exit!  Grease trap!?,not spongebob,0
Lost dead ends?!,spongebob,1
Give us the teddy fish!,not spongebob,0
Teddy fish! Teddy fish!,not spongebob,0
"No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child!  Huh?  Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no.",not spongebob,0
Quick! Get on each other's shoulders.,not spongebob,0
At least some of us will survive.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, come on!",not spongebob,0
Wait! I have a better idea!,spongebob,1
"No SpongeBob, no teddy fish, no customers!  All is lost!",not spongebob,0
Who is it?,not spongebob,0
Tylo!,spongebob,1
Tylo who?,not spongebob,0
Tylosaurus!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!",spongebob,1
Ack!  Get back! Get back!,not spongebob,0
Ginger? Is that you?,not spongebob,0
Mom? What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
We come here every week.,not spongebob,0
We?,not spongebob,0
Yes. Myself and your father and the other parents of kids who were lost here. Where were you?,not spongebob,0
In the Lost and Found!,not spongebob,0
There's a Lost and Found?,not spongebob,0
Hm. Maybe I should put up a sign.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, all the old people are hugging.",spongebob,1
"Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish!",spongebob,1
I don't want that anymore!,not spongebob,0
Huh?  Hmm.,not spongebob,0
I want this!  Whaaa-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess we all learned a lesson about being lost and being found today.",not spongebob,0
"What's that, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
I don't know.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?",spongebob,1
20 minutes in the bath seems like enough.   Another day!  Another day.,not spongebob,0
"Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I'm...   Not ready for work!",spongebob,1
Whatever.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for waiting, Squidward.",spongebob,1
I wasn't waiting.,not spongebob,0
"I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.",spongebob,1
"Yes, I saw that.",not spongebob,0
"I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?",spongebob,1
Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!,not spongebob,0
"I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!   Squidward, what are you doing?!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, look.  We're walking in a straight line.",not spongebob,0
I don't follow.,spongebob,1
A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!,not spongebob,0
"Speak English, brainiac!",spongebob,1
"Well, see, you have point A , where you start, and then there's point...  point... I don't even know what I'm talking about!",not spongebob,0
"Mmm, strawberry!",spongebob,1
Tick!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work!  Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!",spongebob,1
"Oh, for the last time  straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!",not spongebob,0
There is always a shortcut!,spongebob,1
What moron told you that?,not spongebob,0
There's always a shortcut!,not spongebob,0
Huh.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!",spongebob,1
"Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!",not spongebob,0
Yoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
You're not going to come with me?,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there!  That's the face! That's the look!    First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut!  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged!  First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut!  There, that's better.   Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost!",spongebob,1
"First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!",not spongebob,0
"Local landmarks...  A-ha!  Right at this large and unusual shell.  Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant.  There it is, the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
Ahhhh....,not spongebob,0
"Well, look at this. Lazing about.  Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?",not spongebob,0
"No thanks, I got one!  Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.",not spongebob,0
The Krabby Krust?!  Is that the name of a restaurant?,spongebob,1
"No, it's a typo.",not spongebob,0
Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?,spongebob,1
Never heard of it.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom!  Here, take these coupons!",spongebob,1
Thanks! I'm going to go there right now!,not spongebob,0
"I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now?",spongebob,1
"Remember, your landmarks!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money!  Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came...  I'm lost!  Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant!  Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant!  So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out.  Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone.  Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it.  My last dime.  I hope this works.",spongebob,1
Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.",spongebob,1
You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?,not spongebob,0
Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?!,spongebob,1
"If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.",not spongebob,0
"I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?",spongebob,1
"If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, hold on!  Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!",spongebob,1
What are ya doing?,not spongebob,0
Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!,spongebob,1
"This is our abandoned sofa, pal!",not spongebob,0
"What ya doing there, drinking soda?",spongebob,1
What's it tooya!,not spongebob,0
Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?,spongebob,1
"Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, you drive a pedicab?",spongebob,1
"Yes, sir!  You need a ride somewhere?",not spongebob,0
"Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it!",spongebob,1
"Way to go, Scott!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school!  Krusty Klam?!  Wait, Scott, come back!  Tartar sauce!",spongebob,1
Tock!,not spongebob,0
"No! Over the cliff!  Through the toxic runoff!  Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe!  Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire!  Up this massive hill!  That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early!  I made it! I made it!  Oh, random Krusty Krab patrons! How I've missed out!  Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces!  I missed the bathroom, too!   But most of all, I missed you, choking guy!   Patrick? How did you get here?",spongebob,1
Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?!",spongebob,1
Congratulations.,not spongebob,0
"What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that!  You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath!",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!",spongebob,1
What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!,not spongebob,0
"Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!",not spongebob,0
"I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin!  Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?!",not spongebob,0
There you go!  Now get to work!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, you guys open? I have coupons! Buy one, get one free!",not spongebob,0
Oh no! It says Buy one for a fee!,not spongebob,0
Oh! I stand corrected!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh!  Mwah, mwah, mwah! Aaahhh!!! Num-num-num-mmm... Mwah!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, girl! Let's hang out!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I can't, I have to work at Hot-Dog on a String today. Brad called in sick, so I'm in charge of stringing the dogs. Totally lame.",not spongebob,0
I guess I'll see you later then.,not spongebob,0
Uh... Can I get one with extra string?,not spongebob,0
Ugh.,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, girl! Want to come over and make fun of boys or something?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry, girl, I can't. I'm working at Scorched Coral all day. It's heinous.",not spongebob,0
Oh! So heinous. See ya later.,not spongebob,0
"See ya later, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
How much is this choker?,not spongebob,0
"Um, it's a wrist band.",not spongebob,0
Awesome.,not spongebob,0
Nixie speaking.,not spongebob,0
Nixie! My bestest friend in the whole wide world. You should come over. We can watch TV and eat cheese!,not spongebob,0
"I wish I could, Pearl, but I have to work at Dangles and Bangles. All dangles are half off with the purchase of any bangle. Dangle must be of equal or lesser value than bangle. Some restrictions may apply.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you don't work at the mall, do you, Derek?",not spongebob,0
"No, but all my girlfriends do.",not spongebob,0
Daddy! Guess what?,not spongebob,0
"I have no idea, Pearly.",not spongebob,0
"Dad, I'm getting a job today.",not spongebob,0
"Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!",not spongebob,0
Now instead of wasting my precious money on your clothes and your school supplies...  You can waste your own.,not spongebob,0
"I'll be an independent working woman, blazing my own trail and standing on my own two fins.",not spongebob,0
That's the spirit.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, can I borrow $10?",not spongebob,0
I'll miss you around the house.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Daddy, you'll see me after work.",not spongebob,0
I was talkin' to the money.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Marina! I'm here to apply for a job.",not spongebob,0
"You should meet the manager, I guess. He's in his office. Mr. Pepalino, there's someone here for a job.",not spongebob,0
Ah!,not spongebob,0
I-I don't think he's in there.,not spongebob,0
We're not hiring.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away. Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
"I would like to apply for a job, please.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today.",not spongebob,0
"Ah! Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles! This is my last chance, you gotta help me out here! Oh, please, please, please, please, please!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, let me introduce you to the manager. This is--",not spongebob,0
"Nope, not hiring.",not spongebob,0
You don't understand. I have to work here!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, missy, the only thing we don't dangle here... is hope.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, bangles. Ah...  Oh, this is the worst. If I don't get a job at the mall, I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad!",not spongebob,0
"You looking for a job, deary?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah! I need one as soon as possible. It's a life or death situation, actually.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger?",not spongebob,0
In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause I don't have a job.,not spongebob,0
Come with me.,not spongebob,0
Weird. I've never been in this part of the mall before.  Ugh! What's that smell?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron! Congratulations! You're hired.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is the best day of my life!",not spongebob,0
"Ah!  Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days. The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's... no longer with us.",not spongebob,0
"Almost forget my shades! See ya later, suckers!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Pearl. Over here.",not spongebob,0
Did you find a job?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I got a job at Grandma's Apron.",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, you cannot be serious.",not spongebob,0
"Ew, that store is for old people.",not spongebob,0
Old people are so... old.,not spongebob,0
Old people aren't that bad. Are they?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, girls. I smell moth balls.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today.",not spongebob,0
"Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl?",not spongebob,0
"Where's your muumuu, granny?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, Pearly.",not spongebob,0
But it's not fair.,not spongebob,0
"Life's not fair, my dear. We all go through hard times at some point. Here, look. See? I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. They called me Boring Beatrice. Not very creative, those girls.",not spongebob,0
Who would even take a picture of that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, but who took that picture--",not spongebob,0
"All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. Let me show you how grandmas do it.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, come back here, yarn!",not spongebob,0
"Love the shoes, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
"You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun. I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knit mittens, hats, and scarves.",not spongebob,0
Scarves.,not spongebob,0
"It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles!",not spongebob,0
"Now, now, girls. Let's be polite.",not spongebob,0
"What are you gonna do about it, granny?",not spongebob,0
Granny power! Power! Power!,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, toss me the Autumn Years perfume.",not spongebob,0
Hi-ya!,not spongebob,0
It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw a talking picture show. Oh, boy, did they know how to talk.",not spongebob,0
"No, please! I can't take anymore!",not spongebob,0
It's... so... boring!,not spongebob,0
"No, I hate the past!",not spongebob,0
One hour later...,not spongebob,0
"And that's why today, we all wear shoes.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay, we get it, we will stop being mean, I promise, just let us go!",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now, or whatever. We don't really get it.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!",not spongebob,0
Eh.,not spongebob,0
"I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point. You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.",not spongebob,0
"I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but I do miss being a super hip young person.",not spongebob,0
"Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah. How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait up, guys! I want to be friends while I'm still young!",not spongebob,0
I'll see you tomorrow.,not spongebob,0
You dropped this.,spongebob,1
"This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick.  There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over.",spongebob,1
Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes.  She's doing the old granny knot.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll give you a granny knot!",not spongebob,0
All clear! No crime here.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP!  Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close.",spongebob,1
"I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!",not spongebob,0
"I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!",not spongebob,0
I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons.,not spongebob,0
Thank you.,spongebob,1
Let me help you carry this.,spongebob,1
"No—wait, no!",not spongebob,0
Oh—your unmentionables.,spongebob,1
I won't mention this bra.,not spongebob,0
It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh...,not spongebob,0
"While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him!",not spongebob,0

We're not supposed to touch anything!",spongebob,1
But you said you had a question.,not spongebob,0
We could get in trouble!,spongebob,1
"Well, that's not a question.",not spongebob,0
They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!,spongebob,1

That makes sense to me.,not spongebob,0
Then take it.,not spongebob,0
It's not my wallet.,not spongebob,0
You dim ball! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off!,not spongebob,0

"That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.",spongebob,1

You think so?,spongebob,1
"Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size.  Like this pickle! See? They like each other!",not spongebob,0
N-n-n-n-no.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!",spongebob,1
Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?,not spongebob,0

"Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.",spongebob,1
"Well, all right, then. Let her rip!  It worked!",not spongebob,0
Oh no!,spongebob,1
"Look, SpongeBob's giant!  Can I be giant next?",not spongebob,0

"Now, wait just a darn minute!",not spongebob,0
Awww!,not spongebob,0
I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.,not spongebob,0
Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!,not spongebob,0
The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach.,not spongebob,0

Evil?,spongebob,1
Evil?,not spongebob,0
Evil!,not spongebob,0
I'm crossing over... to the dark side!,not spongebob,0

I'll get you crazy kids!,not spongebob,0

"Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?",spongebob,1
You're right.  I give up.,not spongebob,0
You can't give up. What if we help you?,spongebob,1
"No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
Who wants to save the world?,not spongebob,0
I do!,spongebob,1
I do!,not spongebob,0
I do!,not spongebob,0
I don't.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired!",not spongebob,0
Then it's settled! To the Mermalair!,not spongebob,0
Wow! The Mermalair!,spongebob,1
These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!,not spongebob,0
"Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.",spongebob,1
"Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours!",not spongebob,0
Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.,not spongebob,0
Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?,not spongebob,0
I can think of three good reasons.,not spongebob,0
The Quickster...with the uncanny ability to run really...quick!,not spongebob,0
Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  You want to see me do it again?,spongebob,1
Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!,not spongebob,0
Krakatoa!,not spongebob,0
The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms!,not spongebob,0
I can finally touch my toes!,not spongebob,0
And Miss Appear...now you see her...  ...now you don't.,not spongebob,0
Does this outfit make me look fat?,not spongebob,0
The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.,not spongebob,0
"So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.",not spongebob,0
"Super Acquaintances, we need your help.",not spongebob,0
Holy halibut! It's the chief!,spongebob,1
"Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.",not spongebob,0
The whose-abouts of what?,not spongebob,0
"You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say Salsa Verde.",not spongebob,0
"Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at Make-Out Reef. You know, Make-Out Reef?  Whoo hoo hoo!",not spongebob,0
"Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!",spongebob,1
Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.",not spongebob,0
"To Make-Out Reef,  away!",not spongebob,0
Does this mean we're not getting pizza?,not spongebob,0
"Stop, please!",not spongebob,0
"John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!",not spongebob,0
"Oh!  Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!",not spongebob,0
"Haha, with pleasure!",not spongebob,0
"Hey man, that's not cool.",not spongebob,0
Leave those young lovers alone!,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!",not spongebob,0
You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!,not spongebob,0
You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!,not spongebob,0
Make that two!,spongebob,1
The Quickster!,not spongebob,0
Three!,not spongebob,0
Captain Magma!,not spongebob,0
Four!,not spongebob,0
The Elastic Waistband!,not spongebob,0
Five!,not spongebob,0
M-M-Miss Appear!,not spongebob,0
"And me makes ten, I think.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
I don't have a good feeling about this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, there goes our toy deal.",not spongebob,0
"Super Acquaintances, attack!",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, please, mercy!",not spongebob,0
Krakatoa!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!,spongebob,1
"I'll save you, Quickster!",not spongebob,0
"I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls!  Aha!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag...  ma...",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  Aaaaaah!",not spongebob,0
Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...glad that's over!,spongebob,1
"We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.!  You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
World domination! Tell him we want world domination!,not spongebob,0
And make him eat dirt! Hahaha!  In addition to the...domination thing.,not spongebob,0
"Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...",not spongebob,0
"Come on, world domination!",not spongebob,0
I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?,not spongebob,0
"Need a hand, superpal?",not spongebob,0
"Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty!",not spongebob,0
Was that it?  That's sickening!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with a killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Neptune, shut up!",not spongebob,0
"How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing.",not spongebob,0
Huh? Eh?,not spongebob,0
"It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep!  And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.",not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite!  Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.",not spongebob,0
But I must do what I do.  Huh?,not spongebob,0
Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm!,not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club members unite!,not spongebob,0
Unite!,not spongebob,0
And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!",spongebob,1
"Third order of business, the special surprise guest!  The stars of the Mermaid Man movie are here tonight!  Directly from the set, here they are!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, little heroes.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!,spongebob,1
"Well, of course, we are. We're actors.",not spongebob,0
Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?,spongebob,1
"Listen, kid, this is an action movie. Your has-been heroes are too OLD for action.",not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man is timeless!,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this... this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me?  Traitors! Wait ‘til we tell Mermaid Man about this.,spongebob,1
B-47.,not spongebob,0
BONKO!,not spongebob,0
It's bingo.,not spongebob,0
"Get your hands off me, woman!",not spongebob,0
A-29.,not spongebob,0
Too old for an action movie...huh.,spongebob,1
"What is it this time, kid?",not spongebob,0
Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?,spongebob,1
They can't be making a movie about us!,not spongebob,0
But they are! And they're using...  actors.,spongebob,1
They have shunned our heroes.,spongebob,1
And they weren't nice to them either.,not spongebob,0
Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that makes it even worse.",spongebob,1
"You bet it does, kid.",not spongebob,0
And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying.,not spongebob,0
Why don't we just make our own movie?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.",spongebob,1
You will?,not spongebob,0
"Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and...  their actors.",spongebob,1
Vindication is ours! Vindi... how did I get up here?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?",spongebob,1
Popcorn?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, to start making a movie.",spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, oh...",not spongebob,0
Let's start with...the title.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! Adventures in the Underground City.",not spongebob,0
"Great, Pat, what happens?",spongebob,1
"Well, there's a city...",not spongebob,0
City...,spongebob,1
And it's underground...,not spongebob,0
Underground...,spongebob,1
And they have an adventure...,not spongebob,0
Adventure...,spongebob,1
The end.,not spongebob,0
"End.  That's great, Pat.  Hmm, seems kinda short.",spongebob,1
I have an idea. Let's make it longer!,not spongebob,0
"Longer, yes. Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face...  ...shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.",not spongebob,0
"Good one, Pat.",spongebob,1
What are ye lads doing?,not spongebob,0
We're making a movie.,spongebob,1
"Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.",not spongebob,0
"So, what do ye say, lad?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, Mr. Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.",spongebob,1
I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"You can be in it, too, Pearl.",spongebob,1
I'm gonna be a movie star.,not spongebob,0
Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives.,spongebob,1
Howdy.,not spongebob,0
Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair.,spongebob,1
Patrick will run the camera.,spongebob,1
Hey...,not spongebob,0
This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.,spongebob,1
"Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?",not spongebob,0
"Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'.",spongebob,1
Artist?,not spongebob,0
Makeup artist.,spongebob,1
"In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle.  Hmmm...  Time for the art-eest to go to work.  Voila!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?",spongebob,1
As they'll ever be.,not spongebob,0
"They're beautiful! They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Okay, action!",spongebob,1
I love my new job!,not spongebob,0
"Good job, Sandy!",spongebob,1
"Psst...  I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray.",not spongebob,0
What are you doing?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this role was made for me.",not spongebob,0
"That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator!",spongebob,1
I thought Sandy was the boom operator!,not spongebob,0
Did somebody say boom?,not spongebob,0
"All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, start the movie!",spongebob,1
Take 1.,not spongebob,0
We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's stolen Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
Take 2.,not spongebob,0
We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.,not spongebob,0
"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's stolen Krabby Patties!",spongebob,1
"Take 5,003.",not spongebob,0
We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel-,not spongebob,0
Give it back!,not spongebob,0
I knew this was a bad idea.,not spongebob,0
"Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.",spongebob,1
This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.,not spongebob,0
Did somebody say boom?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!",not spongebob,0
"You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, action!",spongebob,1
To the boat mobile.,not spongebob,0
Cue the sound effects.,spongebob,1
Listen to that engine purr.,not spongebob,0
Almost there!,spongebob,1
"Good morning, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I got the footage.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what is that?",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's a camera.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, this.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's a lens cap.",not spongebob,0
Did you just put that on?!,spongebob,1
"Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming.",not spongebob,0
The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!,spongebob,1
"Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and their broccoli was on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.",spongebob,1
"The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou!  Now get out there and finish this movie, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, why are you weeping?",spongebob,1
I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers?! You promised a full house!,not spongebob,0
And here comes the filling!  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.,spongebob,1
"Actually, the real movie was sold out. I'll take 200 tickets, please.",not spongebob,0
"Now, this is what I call a happy ending.",not spongebob,0
"Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen.",not spongebob,0
"Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties.  What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure?  It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!",spongebob,1
Stop! You can't do that forbidden.,not spongebob,0
Watch me!,spongebob,1
"Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain.  You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on.  Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite!",not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
"Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones.",not spongebob,0
"Well, at least some of them.",not spongebob,0
"Salutations, heroic devotees! I hope you're securely seated and sufficiently hydrated, because coming up next, it's the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy marathon!",not spongebob,0
We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.,spongebob,1
Let's do this!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, how are we on snacks?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through...  the first hour.",not spongebob,0
Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?  Check. Drapes?,spongebob,1
Check.,not spongebob,0
Lampshade?,spongebob,1
Check.,not spongebob,0
"Thermometer?  Check. Ukulele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?",spongebob,1
Check.,not spongebob,0
And...,spongebob,1
It's time. It's time. It's time to fight...  evil!,not spongebob,0
"It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have...",spongebob,1
"For sixty-some-odd years, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have quadruple-handedly kept the sea crime-free.  And in celebration of such longevity, we're kicking off this weekend-long hero fest with the never-before-aired Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Special!  And now, without further fanfare,  the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Spe-",not spongebob,0
No...  NO!  No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now?,spongebob,1
Squidward! Squidward! Let us in! We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!,spongebob,1
Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits.  ...what? Circuit must've blown again.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Patrick. All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Thanks for nothing, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans!,not spongebob,0
"We made it!  Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair!",spongebob,1
Again!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
Again!,not spongebob,0
Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?,not spongebob,0
We wanna watch your TV!,not spongebob,0
"I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else. Our power got knocked out in the storm.",not spongebob,0
"But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret gorinin?",not spongebob,0
"Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!",spongebob,1
"...Yeah, so?",not spongebob,0
"So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?",spongebob,1
Whoa! You're like a brain professor!,not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started.",spongebob,1
"You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-",not spongebob,0
"Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo.",not spongebob,0
"Oh... right.  Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad,  when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped.",not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!,not spongebob,0
"...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach,  when suddenly, I became drowsy.  A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean!  Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast.  But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids.  They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater.",not spongebob,0
"Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, how'd you two meet?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater.  Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too.",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye.",not spongebob,0
"A boy in trouble! I've got to act fast or he'll drown.  Fear not, young man. I'll take care of this.",not spongebob,0
"I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together.",spongebob,1
"No, no, no...  The reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life.",not spongebob,0
Oh... yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Anyway, from that day forward, we became",not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!",not spongebob,0
A crime in progress!,not spongebob,0
Stop! Thief!,not spongebob,0
"See if you think this is funny, evildoer.  Who's laughing now, thieving scum?",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, sir. And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?",not spongebob,0
"You can thank me, Mermaid Man.",not spongebob,0
You're mine!,not spongebob,0
"How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?",not spongebob,0
"Hello...  So? What are you wearing?  Oh. In that case, can I get a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese? Thanks.",not spongebob,0
That didn't happen!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, it did!",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, it didn't!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, ha ha, like you remember. You don't even remember where you live.",not spongebob,0
It didn't happen!,not spongebob,0
"And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is it!",spongebob,1
The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Ernie! The movie's about to start... Where's the popcorn?",not spongebob,0
"It's in the microwave, Tim.",not spongebob,0
"At that very moment in the apartment directly above, a rogue scientist doing tests on radioactive ants knocks over a jar of his infected specimens, one of which, without any hesitation, crawls down one floor and miraculously lands undetected. It viciously bites our soon-to-be superhero. He screams in pain,...",not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
...stumbling backwards.,not spongebob,0
What on earth?,not spongebob,0
"In a split-second, both men find themselves in a freefall that sends them squarely through the roof of a vats of acid factory, and into a vat of acid that is tipped over by an errant alien spaceship, carrying the two blindly on a wave of acid during a solar eclipse on a leap year, precariously careening onto a bomb-testing site, where a cataclysmic explosion exposes our heroes in waiting to highly toxic radium gases. Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, the popcorn's ready!",not spongebob,0
...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn.,not spongebob,0
Mmmm... I think you overcooked this a little.,not spongebob,0
"Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy.",not spongebob,0
I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air.,not spongebob,0
As do I.,not spongebob,0
And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as...  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Defenders of the Deep!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?",not spongebob,0
"...No, not really.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!",spongebob,1
This is gonna be so super awesome!,not spongebob,0
So superhero awesome!,spongebob,1
No! Stop! But you're not superhero material! Look at those shoes!,not spongebob,0
"You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Daddy.  I made you breakfast.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today.",not spongebob,0
"Open up, it's time for the pill.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill.  Pearl, do you think I'm... old?",not spongebob,0
"Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.",not spongebob,0
"But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?",not spongebob,0
"See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say coral, as in, That nose job is so coral.",not spongebob,0
"Coral, eh?",not spongebob,0
"Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral.",not spongebob,0
"Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?",not spongebob,0
"Whoop, you're right!  Have a coral day, honey.",not spongebob,0
Jenny? It's Pearl. Coral is definitely out.,not spongebob,0
Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little...  Sorry you had to see that.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, how's about I join you kids?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people always have to ruin the fun?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, no cuttin'! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else!",not spongebob,0
No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old!,not spongebob,0
What's his problem?,not spongebob,0
Next?,not spongebob,0
"Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny.",not spongebob,0
"Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there.  Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.",not spongebob,0
"♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...♪",not spongebob,0
"Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster.  Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Krusty Krew!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's gonna rock!",not spongebob,0
Are you ready to go crazy?,spongebob,1
I'm already hearing voices!,not spongebob,0
Are you ready to—,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!,not spongebob,0
"Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!",spongebob,1
"Well, how rude of some people!",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town.",not spongebob,0
Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!,spongebob,1
Party!,not spongebob,0
What do you think we should do first?,spongebob,1
"What shouldn't we do first? We're young,  we've got wheels,  the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, boys, hangin' out?",not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!",not spongebob,0
"I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.",not spongebob,0
Style!,not spongebob,0
Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh...",not spongebob,0
I'm waiting... old man.,not spongebob,0
Uhh... how do you do?,not spongebob,0
"Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.",not spongebob,0
"You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?,not spongebob,0
"I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.",spongebob,1
8:01 PM.,not spongebob,0
"Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par-,not spongebob,0
"Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad!",not spongebob,0
"So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?",not spongebob,0
Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker.,spongebob,1
It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.,not spongebob,0
"Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself.",spongebob,1
Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?,not spongebob,0
Only the cool kids.,spongebob,1
"Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!",not spongebob,0
"We're not lost, I've got my compass.",spongebob,1
"So long, dorks!",not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, pals!",spongebob,1
We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now.,not spongebob,0
Here we are: The Wash.,spongebob,1
"They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.",not spongebob,0
"Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.",spongebob,1
Cool. Gotcha.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!",spongebob,1
Let's party!,not spongebob,0
Any port in the store—! Wait a minute...this is a Laundromat.,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talkin’ about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo!",not spongebob,0
You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.,spongebob,1
"You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!",spongebob,1
Debauchery!,not spongebob,0
"Debauchery!  Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...",not spongebob,0
"So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Not yet.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, you will.  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
I'm feeling a warm spot.,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?",spongebob,1
"I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's not a ride.",spongebob,1
Get off of me!,not spongebob,0
"Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Shhh!,not spongebob,0
"How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"So, you wanna know if I can feel it?",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?,not spongebob,0
Yes!,not spongebob,0
I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!,not spongebob,0
Lame?!,spongebob,1
Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!,not spongebob,0
Not 'babies!',not spongebob,0
"I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!",not spongebob,0
I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.,not spongebob,0
The what?,not spongebob,0
"I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.",not spongebob,0
"Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!",not spongebob,0
Not lame!,not spongebob,0
Now this is more like it!,not spongebob,0
"Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals!",not spongebob,0
We score here all the time.,spongebob,1
Frilly things! We hit the jackpot!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again!",not spongebob,0
Eugene?,not spongebob,0
Mother?,not spongebob,0
What are you doing with my bloomers?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh,  hehe...  Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!",not spongebob,0
Why didn't you ask?,spongebob,1
But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!,not spongebob,0
"Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mommy.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Good night, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Eugene, lights out!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mommy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I lost my pen.",not spongebob,0
You can borrow mine.,not spongebob,0
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.,spongebob,1
"So, anyway, thanks for the pen.",not spongebob,0
"No problem, hon.",not spongebob,0
It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.,spongebob,1
I've gotta go.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!",spongebob,1
"What is it, Peterson?",not spongebob,0
I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance.,not spongebob,0
"That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Ooh!  Uh oh.  All right!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Hi Patrick!,spongebob,1
Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and who's Patrick?",not spongebob,0
And why did you eat Snail-Po?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, uh...  Oh.",not spongebob,0
Is there a problem?,spongebob,1
"Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.",not spongebob,0
"While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.",not spongebob,0
"But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?",spongebob,1
Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica!,not spongebob,0
"I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?",spongebob,1
"Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?",not spongebob,0
"Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.",not spongebob,0
"Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.",spongebob,1
"Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...",not spongebob,0
"Cover me till I get back, okay?",spongebob,1
"Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!",not spongebob,0
"Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?",spongebob,1
As I do every morning.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I need you to do it again.",spongebob,1
"That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you talking about?",spongebob,1
My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!",spongebob,1
You lost your name tag?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?",spongebob,1
"I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say hi, just like this morning.",not spongebob,0
"Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
You were supposed to say hi to me!,spongebob,1
Hi.,not spongebob,0
"Oh. All right, let's take it from the top.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Don't forget your line this time!,spongebob,1
I won't.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!",spongebob,1
What's my motivation?,not spongebob,0
Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Ugh!,spongebob,1
"Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob!  Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.",spongebob,1
"Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins...",spongebob,1
"Hi, Mr. J.",not spongebob,0
"...placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk...  and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!  Whoa!",spongebob,1
That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.",spongebob,1
"Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, what is that stench?",spongebob,1
"That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.",spongebob,1
I wish I had a nose.,not spongebob,0
"Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.",spongebob,1
Cannonball!,not spongebob,0
You look over there and I'll look over here.,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Patrick?,spongebob,1
I'm looking. I'm looking.,not spongebob,0
Patrick? Patrick!,spongebob,1
I'm looking as fast as I can.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!  Thank you.,spongebob,1
"Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?",not spongebob,0
Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.,spongebob,1
Could I have another hint?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob...",not spongebob,0
"Not now, Patrick.",spongebob,1
I know where your name tag is.,not spongebob,0
Where?! Where?!,spongebob,1
Uh... I can't remember.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I don't have time for this!",spongebob,1
There it is!,not spongebob,0
Where?!,spongebob,1
Uh...  I forgot again.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, are you with me or against me?",spongebob,1
Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!",spongebob,1
"Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.",not spongebob,0
"My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Don't mention it, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.",not spongebob,0
Hoorah.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, boy, your turn.",not spongebob,0
I think you'll find everything shipshape.,spongebob,1
Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?,not spongebob,0
"Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story.",spongebob,1
"Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, uh...  Betty.",spongebob,1
"What?  Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners.",not spongebob,0
"You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place.  Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words.  Now to attack these floors!",spongebob,1
Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!,not spongebob,0
Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates.,spongebob,1
And he's been with me for such a long time now.,not spongebob,0
I am.,spongebob,1
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.,not spongebob,0
"Yep, he's gonna have to--   What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or  Squidward!  Phew! I am taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!",spongebob,1
"No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement.",spongebob,1
What do you think you're doing?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy...  ...and it looks like it is you!",spongebob,1
"No, I'm not!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!  We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet!",spongebob,1
I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!,not spongebob,0
"You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa!  Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts.  Face the facts that I'm the little guy!  And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.",spongebob,1
Krabs is letting you go today?  As in I won't have to work with you ever again.,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go.  Gotten too big for his cage.  Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's the use, Gary?  I've lost the will to go on!   Hi, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.",not spongebob,0
What happened to yours?,spongebob,1
"Nothing, it's just empty.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.",spongebob,1
"Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, or Gary,  or for anybody!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!",not spongebob,0
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.,spongebob,1
"I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when I'm looking for a job.  Kick back, watch some TV,  and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage!",not spongebob,0
"Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds.  Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones.  Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. Bank Teller Needed. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking.  20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97.  Order up!   What do you think, boss?",spongebob,1
"Clam shells! What have you done, boy?  I told you to build me a house, not a sandwich!",not spongebob,0
"I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick.  I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, This is a job for a sponge. Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!",not spongebob,0
"I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?",spongebob,1
Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.,not spongebob,0
"That's just a billboard, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Why don't you get a job as a billboard?,not spongebob,0
"I...don't think that's physically possible,  but I could audition to be a sponge model.",spongebob,1
"Fine, do it your way.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?",spongebob,1
Why don't you find out?,not spongebob,0
"Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back.",spongebob,1
No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. This is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries!   My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, want is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it.  I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it.",not spongebob,0
I did?,spongebob,1
Show me what you got.,not spongebob,0
"Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?  ♪ Laaa! ♪  Sorry.",spongebob,1
"Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, getting on it.  ♪ When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim! ♪",spongebob,1
"All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough.",not spongebob,0
How'd I do?,spongebob,1
"Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you.  But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours.  Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late.",not spongebob,0
I guess a sponge can make it in this town.  I am going to be a star!,spongebob,1
"I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants.  I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?",not spongebob,0
Fantastic.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes I did, Patrick.  I said, You're looking at the new face of television.",spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, beauty sleep!",not spongebob,0
That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.,spongebob,1
"Afternoon, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you.",spongebob,1
"What was that about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you're back!",not spongebob,0
A star's first day is his most important.,spongebob,1
"Great. Let me see if they're ready on set.  SpongeBob's here, sir. Uh-huh. Okay, great.  Okay, you can go right in.",not spongebob,0
"Yippee!  I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.",spongebob,1
Very well.  Lose the pants!  Hans! Where's my star?!,not spongebob,0
Whoa! What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's happening?!,spongebob,1
"In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?",spongebob,1
Don't you get it? You are the cleaning utensil.  Roll speed!,not spongebob,0
New Sponge Commercial: Take one.,not spongebob,0
Action!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge!  Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks.  Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers!  Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new!  But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle!",not spongebob,0
Nooo!  I can't do this!,spongebob,1
Cut!,not spongebob,0
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.,spongebob,1
Was? You said you were professional actor.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister.",spongebob,1
Wait! Wait!,not spongebob,0
Ever so gently...,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs!  Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better.  Please.",spongebob,1
"Boy, what are you going on about?!",not spongebob,0
"I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.",spongebob,1
"All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!",spongebob,1
"Hey, could you keep it down in there?  I'm trying to concentrate!",not spongebob,0
"May I help you, sir?",spongebob,1
I'd like that table over by the window.,not spongebob,0
As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.,spongebob,1
97... 98... 99...,not spongebob,0
"Don't rush me, woman!",not spongebob,0
Perhaps this will speed up the process.,not spongebob,0
How will that help them chew faster?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what's the problem?",not spongebob,0
"No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.",spongebob,1
Five bucks if I get the table now.,not spongebob,0
"Ow, my hip.",not spongebob,0
Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.,not spongebob,0
Why did you give him the table?,spongebob,1
You know what they say: Money Talks.,not spongebob,0
I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out?  What do you have against old people?,spongebob,1
"Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.",not spongebob,0
Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?,spongebob,1
Yeah. Wait a minute...,not spongebob,0
What's that music?,not spongebob,0
I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.,spongebob,1
"Oh, great.",not spongebob,0

Shoes?,not spongebob,0
Oh no...,spongebob,1
"Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom.",not spongebob,0
"That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times.",not spongebob,0
You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.,not spongebob,0
We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.,not spongebob,0
"Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?",spongebob,1
"Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?",not spongebob,0
Seat-belt-aroony. One second.,spongebob,1
Then what do you do?,not spongebob,0
Start the engine?,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
Now what do I do?,spongebob,1
Drive the boat.,not spongebob,0
"Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, you failed.",not spongebob,0
I failed?,spongebob,1
"It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.",not spongebob,0
"I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore?  No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life.  Free at last! Free at last!",not spongebob,0
I got Mrs. Puff fired.,spongebob,1
"Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor.  No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.",not spongebob,0
Does that mean...,not spongebob,0
Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, I'll eat one.",not spongebob,0
Pick your favorite.  How's it taste?,not spongebob,0
It's a delightful taste sensation.,not spongebob,0
"No eating in my classroom!  Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class...  Looks like you're the man, Sponge.",not spongebob,0
I am?,spongebob,1
Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive",spongebob,1
What do you think you're doing?,not spongebob,0
"Ready for my test, sir.",spongebob,1
"You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first.  This is  most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.",not spongebob,0
Crawl?,spongebob,1
Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two.,not spongebob,0
Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!,spongebob,1
"Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.",not spongebob,0
Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew!,spongebob,1
"I'm ashamed of you, cadet.  Tripped up by a wee pebble.  What are you suppose to be learning in my class?",not spongebob,0
"How to drive, sir?",spongebob,1
"Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl.  I want you to crawl!",not spongebob,0
"Sir, yes, sir!",spongebob,1
"Now get out there!  Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out.  Here, go take that boat apart.  I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!",not spongebob,0
That'll be easy.,spongebob,1
Are you sure?,not spongebob,0
"Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge!",spongebob,1
Jumpin' jellyfish...,not spongebob,0
"Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?",spongebob,1
How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!,not spongebob,0
"Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?",spongebob,1
Not quite.  Now do it blindfolded.,not spongebob,0
Several days later...,not spongebob,0
"1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.",spongebob,1
Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.,not spongebob,0
Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm...,spongebob,1
"Let's see what I taught you, laddy.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!  Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball.  Nice boy.",spongebob,1
"Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead.  Very good.  Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts.",spongebob,1
"Excellent work, cadet. What's next?",not spongebob,0
Step 2 would be... ignite engine.,spongebob,1
Step 3?,not spongebob,0
Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold.,spongebob,1
What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.,not spongebob,0
But I can't do it without a blindfold.,spongebob,1
"Drive, boy! Drive!",not spongebob,0
Mayday! Mayday! You're off course.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0

My pants!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I can't see!  Did I pass?",spongebob,1
"Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.",not spongebob,0
The nerve of some people.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm unteachable.",spongebob,1
"It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back.  And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion,  so it's as if you never failed.",not spongebob,0
"I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.  I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.",spongebob,1
It's time to grow myself large and wide.,spongebob,1
"Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?",not spongebob,0
"Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumpin' iron. Check it out.",spongebob,1
"Well, you're smelly.",not spongebob,0
All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set.,spongebob,1
"Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, really?",spongebob,1
"That is, if you want arms like these...  ...or these...  ...or these!",not spongebob,0
"Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.",spongebob,1
"Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.",not spongebob,0

"Hey! Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! Oh, I'm a little peanut worm. Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"With Anchor arms!  They slip on like a glove. Just add air.  How big do you want 'em?  Normal?  Veiny!? And for the ladies...  ...hairy.  I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk, and everybody loves me! So order now, wimp!",not spongebob,0

What? Would you get out of here?,not spongebob,0
"The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.",spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for!?

"Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.",spongebob,1

"So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.",not spongebob,0
"He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!",spongebob,1
"Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear!",not spongebob,0

I bet he bites whale bubbles.,spongebob,1

"We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash! The fake inspector has been captured! Here is his picture.  If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.",not spongebob,0
"Phew! That's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.",spongebob,1
"I don't think he'll be laughin', boy...",not spongebob,0
"Why, sir?",spongebob,1
Because that patty killed him!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do!?",spongebob,1
What's this we stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!,not spongebob,0
But you told me to give it to him!,spongebob,1
"Well, you could've talked me out of it!",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me.",spongebob,1

You mean in here?,not spongebob,0
It's empty?,not spongebob,0
Is this some kind of a joke?,not spongebob,0
Yeah... a joke!,not spongebob,0

You guys...,not spongebob,0
"TAKE THAT, ZOMBIE!",not spongebob,0
"I'll take it from here.  DIE, ZOMBIE!",not spongebob,0
"Good police work, Officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.",not spongebob,0
"Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price!  Well, not really.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?",not spongebob,0

"Well, I.",spongebob,1
This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I've been thinking.",spongebob,1
We need to get you thinking about work.,not spongebob,0
"No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish.",spongebob,1
"Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back.",not spongebob,0

Ol' Reliable?,not spongebob,0
"Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?",not spongebob,0
"No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.",spongebob,1
He took off his pants.,not spongebob,0
I'll give him a week.,not spongebob,0
I'll give him eleven minutes.,not spongebob,0

"Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!  There he is, Patrick. Say your line!",not spongebob,0

"If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy!  I even picked out this nice jar for you!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now!,spongebob,1
"I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! No!,spongebob,1
Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters.  Mmm, jelly.  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning.  Greetings, comrades!  Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy!  Ah! Poison sea urchins!  Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches.  Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.  Krabby Patties.  Sandy.  What have I done?

"Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.",not spongebob,0
"Do you really think that, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that.",spongebob,1
"Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly.  Yellow is ugly!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you talking about?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you.  You give bottom dwellers a bad name.",not spongebob,0
"If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!",spongebob,1

"I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy...  Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!",spongebob,1
Me neither! This was a setup!,not spongebob,0
I thought you two were my best friends.,not spongebob,0
I am your best friend!,not spongebob,0
"Well, how about some soda, guys?",not spongebob,0

Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more.  Why don't you just stay here and chat?  I should just walk away right now.  What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today?",not spongebob,0
"Guess what, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Me and SpongeBob are friends again!,not spongebob,0
"Great, now go be friends somewhere else.",not spongebob,0
Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?,spongebob,1
No! Out!,not spongebob,0
"Psst, I think he's jealous.",spongebob,1
How pathetic.,not spongebob,0
"Ohhhhh, my back.",not spongebob,0
"Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.",not spongebob,0
Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...,spongebob,1
...the golden spatula. Wow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!",spongebob,1
"Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is?",not spongebob,0
Uh!,not spongebob,0
"Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.",spongebob,1
Holy smokes!,not spongebob,0
"Rude. Hey, the light changed.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick...",spongebob,1
"Hold on, almost there.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.",spongebob,1
"A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!",not spongebob,0
"But, but...",spongebob,1
"A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.",not spongebob,0
Then who pulled out the spatula?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, he did.",not spongebob,0
"It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!",not spongebob,0
"Who, me?",not spongebob,0
You have the physique of Atlas!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, I work out.",not spongebob,0
Make poses with me!,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
Body slam!,not spongebob,0
You pulled the spatula from the grease!,not spongebob,0
"Nope, that was SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.",not spongebob,0
Like?,spongebob,1
"The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I've got two.",spongebob,1
"Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six...",not spongebob,0
He is the new royal fry cook and you...,not spongebob,0
Silence!,not spongebob,0
Is it hot in here or what?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!",spongebob,1
"So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!",not spongebob,0
Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.,not spongebob,0
Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.,not spongebob,0
Only two? What are two challenges to someone like Sponge-,not spongebob,0
Three challenges!,not spongebob,0
Three?   Three challenges is nothing. It might as well be 500 challenges!,not spongebob,0
Enough!,not spongebob,0
He'll settle for one.,not spongebob,0
There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!,not spongebob,0
I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.,spongebob,1
"Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!",not spongebob,0
How you feeling?,spongebob,1
"Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?",not spongebob,0
"And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that sounds pretty good.",not spongebob,0
"But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?",not spongebob,0
I'm ready.,spongebob,1
Very well then. To the Poseidome!,not spongebob,0
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.",not spongebob,0
May the best man win.,spongebob,1
"Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!",not spongebob,0
"I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.",spongebob,1
"Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds. Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!",not spongebob,0
Once upon a time...,spongebob,1
Perfect!,spongebob,1
1000 and SpongeBob: 1],not spongebob,0
"I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh.",not spongebob,0
"You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time!",not spongebob,0
"So, uhh, what do you think?",spongebob,1
"Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win.",not spongebob,0
Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis!,not spongebob,0
What's so funny?,spongebob,1
"You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?",not spongebob,0
"You mean, Patrick can't come?",spongebob,1
"No, of course not.",not spongebob,0
And my friends?,spongebob,1
"Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.",not spongebob,0
"It was nice knowing you, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.",spongebob,1
I lost me bet!,not spongebob,0
"Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!",not spongebob,0
I... I...  I don't wanna go!,spongebob,1
It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!",spongebob,1
"Good morning, Krusty Krew.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?",spongebob,1
"The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove!  Haha!",not spongebob,0
"What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?",spongebob,1
"Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.",not spongebob,0
"Gotta hurry, Gary!  The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I'm just going to turn out the lights.  Clickety poo! And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?  TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job.",spongebob,1
One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four.,not spongebob,0
"Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat.",spongebob,1
Spill at table...,not spongebob,0
"I'm on it!  Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle.  Kiddies get a free touch-up.  All done!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did.,spongebob,1
What'd you do?,not spongebob,0
I was a minute late for work!,spongebob,1
A minute late?,not spongebob,0
A whole 60 seconds.,spongebob,1
"Well, uh, don't do it again.",not spongebob,0
No! No! You have to punish me!,spongebob,1
"Well, you can clean the salad bar.",not spongebob,0
Aye aye sir.,spongebob,1
And good night.,not spongebob,0
"I love it here, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh.",not spongebob,0
"If you love it so much, why don't you just live here?",not spongebob,0
"Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock?  Maybe it's my old bed.  Oh, that's it.  I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir.",spongebob,1
How long you been here?,not spongebob,0
"All night, sir.",spongebob,1
All night?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again.",spongebob,1
"Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son.",not spongebob,0
Here's my first month's rent.,spongebob,1
"Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill...",not spongebob,0
"Already done, sir.",spongebob,1
"Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties...",not spongebob,0
"Done.  All that, before we even open up our doors, sir.",spongebob,1
Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess.,not spongebob,0
"Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up.",spongebob,1
Jammed again.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh. Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob? What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I live here now.",spongebob,1
In the dishwasher?,not spongebob,0
"No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me.",not spongebob,0
Must be a full moon.  Mr. Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!.",not spongebob,0
"Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No. Coming Eugene.  Good night's sleep, here I come.  And when I went home at night, guess what?",not spongebob,0
He wasn't there?,not spongebob,0
Right! And when I woke up in the morning...,not spongebob,0
Can I just get my change?,not spongebob,0
He still wasn't there.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, man, my change.",not spongebob,0
Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks...  Oh, real funny, buddy. Two socks and a pair of tighty whities.",not spongebob,0
"Socks and--  What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection.  So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.",not spongebob,0
Do you want to know where the mustard is?,spongebob,1
"Ah! Eww.  Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor.",not spongebob,0
"Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces.",not spongebob,0
"Well, they don't see to mind.",spongebob,1
Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.,not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, captain.",spongebob,1
Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—meaning yours—to interfere with said money spending.  What the barnacles?  SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?,not spongebob,0
It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen.  So I moved in here.,spongebob,1
"You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.",not spongebob,0
"But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!",spongebob,1
"Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, Mr...  My parents!",spongebob,1
Your parents?,not spongebob,0
"Mom! Dad! Come on in.  And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Oh, hello.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll let you two get settled.",spongebob,1
Is this your snail?,not spongebob,0
Gary! Bad boy! No!,spongebob,1
Put that thing on a leash.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, who put these fancy-smelling soaps in the restroom?",not spongebob,0
The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu.,not spongebob,0
"Argh.  That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer.",not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know...",not spongebob,0
What's going on in here?!,not spongebob,0
"No, I...  What the...?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, SpongeBob.  If I could reach it, I'd do it myself.",not spongebob,0
"Me customers!  Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money!  SpongeBob! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out.",not spongebob,0
"What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums!",spongebob,1
Noooo!,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
I surrender!,not spongebob,0
"Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.",not spongebob,0
"There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?",not spongebob,0
"What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.",not spongebob,0
"Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!",not spongebob,0
But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?,not spongebob,0
Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!,not spongebob,0
"Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?",not spongebob,0
What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!",not spongebob,0
You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?,not spongebob,0
No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?",not spongebob,0
"I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.",not spongebob,0
"Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career.",not spongebob,0
What's going on Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever you say, cap'n.",spongebob,1
Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.",spongebob,1
"Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.",spongebob,1
"Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.",not spongebob,0
"That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Right away, sir.",spongebob,1
"Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!",not spongebob,0
This is idiotic.,not spongebob,0
Dance or you're fired.,not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"How do you like them apples, you little...",not spongebob,0
"Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war.",not spongebob,0
Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.,not spongebob,0
"Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?",not spongebob,0
Grr...,not spongebob,0
But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.,not spongebob,0
Bubkes.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.",not spongebob,0
"Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, but no.",not spongebob,0
"A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.",not spongebob,0
"Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive!  SEE?! Who's the one with the problem?!",not spongebob,0
Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.,not spongebob,0
"Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow.",not spongebob,0
Get out!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.",not spongebob,0
"What's this?  Hey, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
I knew you'd come back.,not spongebob,0
You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.,not spongebob,0
I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Coming, coming.  Yo.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Plankton?",not spongebob,0
Eugene?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, hey.",not spongebob,0
Hey.,not spongebob,0
"Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?",not spongebob,0
Yes. I'm still here.,not spongebob,0
"Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?",not spongebob,0
Sure.,not spongebob,0
"Glad you could make it, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"So, what's this about, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.",not spongebob,0
"Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you.",not spongebob,0
"That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.",not spongebob,0
"And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.",not spongebob,0
"No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.",not spongebob,0
I can't believe you would even think...,not spongebob,0
Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.,not spongebob,0
"You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, take it.",not spongebob,0
"You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Sure is, buddy. Sure is.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician.",not spongebob,0
I'd never give you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.,not spongebob,0
"Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary.  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.",spongebob,1
"Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?,spongebob,1
Wait for you to get back.,not spongebob,0
"Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?",spongebob,1
"Hey, that's a great idea!",not spongebob,0
You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!,spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.",spongebob,1
And no line.,not spongebob,0
"Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.",spongebob,1
"And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?",not spongebob,0
"No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.",spongebob,1
Where is everyone?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'til 9.",spongebob,1
6:20? But I thought you said you were late.,not spongebob,0
Late for being early!,spongebob,1
Hey...  When did I start wearing a watch?,not spongebob,0
"And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.",spongebob,1
Ohh.,not spongebob,0
And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.,spongebob,1
Ohhh.,not spongebob,0
And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.,spongebob,1
"Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!",not spongebob,0
"Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.",spongebob,1
But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.",spongebob,1
Who said that?  Was it him?,not spongebob,0
"I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.",spongebob,1
What does he teach us?,not spongebob,0
"The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes... Roger would die.",spongebob,1
LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
Sorry...,not spongebob,0
The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?,spongebob,1
I'm learning!,not spongebob,0
This is gonna be great!,spongebob,1
"Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?",not spongebob,0
Who's the fat kid talking to?,not spongebob,0
"You, Patrick, she's the teacher.",spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous.",not spongebob,0
Uhh...guhhhh...,not spongebob,0
We just want to know your name.,not spongebob,0
Gyuhhh...uhhh...guhhhh...24.,not spongebob,0
HAHAHAHAHAHA!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great, another genius...",not spongebob,0
Why are they laughing?,not spongebob,0
I guess it's just in the timing.,spongebob,1
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Today's first lesson will be on turning.,not spongebob,0
24.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
I thought of something funnier than 24.,spongebob,1
Let me hear it.,not spongebob,0
...25.,spongebob,1
"That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
"Now then, Turning; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least...",not spongebob,0
"Big Fat Meanie!?! Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!",spongebob,1
"What about the teacher?  AS IF I REALLY LOOK LIKE THIS!  SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions.",not spongebob,0
No...,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle.",not spongebob,0
I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!!,spongebob,1
You'll get this star back when you earn it.,not spongebob,0
"NOOOO!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!",spongebob,1
"Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!",not spongebob,0
"What, me? But why?",spongebob,1
Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks a lot, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Sure thing, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?",spongebob,1
"Psst, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Just ignore him, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, over here.",not spongebob,0
"Whatever you do, don't look at him.",spongebob,1
"Psst, SpongeBob.  Psst, SpongeBob.  SpongeBo-ob!  SpongeBob? Psst, over heeeere... I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.",not spongebob,0
What?!?!,spongebob,1
Hi.,not spongebob,0
HIIIIIIIIIIIIII?!?!?!,spongebob,1
Perhaps this would be a good time for recess.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.",not spongebob,0
"There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!",spongebob,1
Who cares about a stupid star?,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, CONSIDERING YOU ARE ONE!",spongebob,1
I'll deal with you after class!,not spongebob,0
It is after class!,spongebob,1
"I don't see anyone fighting, do you?",not spongebob,0
They're talking about us! We're fighting!,spongebob,1
"Well, don't mind if I do!",not spongebob,0
This is embarrassing.,not spongebob,0
What's going on here?!  Well?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob and I were fighting.,not spongebob,0
"Fighting?  Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend  to detention!",not spongebob,0
Detention!?,spongebob,1
May Neptune have mercy on your soul.,not spongebob,0
"In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
I hate you more.,not spongebob,0
I'd hate you no matter what.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.",not spongebob,0
I'd hate you even if that made sense.,spongebob,1
I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.,not spongebob,0
"I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?",spongebob,1
Ohh...  Hmph.,not spongebob,0
Ohhhhh...!,not spongebob,0
Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!,spongebob,1
I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs--,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, your apology is so long!",spongebob,1
Me too! Let's save Roger!,not spongebob,0
I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet!,spongebob,1
"Ahh! LIGHT BULB!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth.  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!",spongebob,1
"Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!",not spongebob,0
"We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!",spongebob,1
"Good job boys!  I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.",not spongebob,0
"Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big, Fat Meanie.",not spongebob,0
Hey! What'd I miss?,not spongebob,0
"And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Whoa! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that?",spongebob,1
"Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today!",spongebob,1
"Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy?",not spongebob,0
The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Get a hold of yourself, boy.",not spongebob,0
"What is it now, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!",spongebob,1
Then don't blink.,not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Yes, it's working...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got fifty orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.",not spongebob,0
You want me to go in there?,spongebob,1
"Save me, the darkness!",spongebob,1
"Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?",not spongebob,0
Night light?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!",not spongebob,0
"Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Night light, night light... Oh!  Oh, it's beautiful!  Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?",spongebob,1
"If I answer Yes, will you leave the store sooner?",not spongebob,0
"Now that I can see...  Woo-hoo! I can sleep!  I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom!  Night light! Night light!  Oh, thank you, thank you!  There, there, there, and there.  I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary.  Now there's not one square inch of dark!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"What was that, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob's having a party without me?  Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that.",not spongebob,0
"That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick!  What is that, Gary?  Patrick, what are you doing!?",spongebob,1
Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.,not spongebob,0
"You know what that means?  Sleepover!  Your sleeping bag, sir.",spongebob,1
"Thank you, my good man.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t...",spongebob,1
The dark!,not spongebob,0
Burning!,not spongebob,0
"The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us...",spongebob,1
What are you two whimpering about?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, Squidward, you idiots!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?",not spongebob,0
"But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination.",not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark!  Oh, why won't he listen?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?",spongebob,1
"Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!",not spongebob,0
"You said it, Pat!",spongebob,1
"Quick, SpongeBob! Turn it on!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights!",not spongebob,0
The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time.,not spongebob,0

Barnacle Boy!,not spongebob,0
Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?,spongebob,1
We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you.",spongebob,1
"Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless there's a real emergency.  And another thing: What the-!?  Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemeses—My mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! At last, I have you! Come get some, fiend!  Come back here, rival!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here!",spongebob,1
"Savory light, come to me!",not spongebob,0
"Say, let me help you!  Is that enough light for you?  Well, he's all taken care of.",spongebob,1
Who?,not spongebob,0
"The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon!",spongebob,1
See you in another 57 years!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
I think it's time to go home.,not spongebob,0
Why are we here again?,not spongebob,0
"Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!",not spongebob,0
Who are those two hideous creatures of the dark?,not spongebob,0
"I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!",not spongebob,0

"What was that, Mrs. Puff?",not spongebob,0
"Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit!  I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.",not spongebob,0
What's extra credit?,not spongebob,0
It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.,not spongebob,0
Oh…..,not spongebob,0
"Now, are we ready for that extra credit?",not spongebob,0
Extra credit!,not spongebob,0
"That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.",not spongebob,0

No!,not spongebob,0
Give it to me!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Let me see it!  What I learned in boating school is… Uh…  Well, the rest doesn't matter!  You pass!  You pass!",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.",not spongebob,0
That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.,not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Besides, here's your license.",not spongebob,0
"My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!",not spongebob,0
"Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!  La La La La!  La La La La!",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Harris, happy birthday!  My leg!",not spongebob,0
"So much destruction...this reporter asks, Why? Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who-  OOF!",not spongebob,0
La la la la!,not spongebob,0
Let's- not- use that take.,not spongebob,0
That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive.  Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.,not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
To the greatest teacher ever!,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family.",not spongebob,0
"I think you made your point, Dear.",not spongebob,0
"Ahem.  Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I...Okay.",not spongebob,0
"We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...",not spongebob,0
See what?,not spongebob,0
Ta-da.,not spongebob,0
A brand new boatmobile?!,not spongebob,0
For me...?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...he'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!",not spongebob,0
"What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name...! No. Not again! I've got to end this before it begins.",not spongebob,0
"You took quite a buster there, son.",not spongebob,0
What I learned in Boating School today is!,not spongebob,0
"We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.",not spongebob,0
"That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea!",not spongebob,0
I hope I still remember how to do this.  Hehehe yeah…,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm driving!",not spongebob,0
Aaaaahhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
"Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SKIING!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!",spongebob,1
"No, you don't! You don't know who I am!",not spongebob,0
Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray.  Somebody help me!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good.",not spongebob,0
"Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm not letting go. Nothing will stop me! Not even…  Giant clams?!?!  I'm… not… letting… go! Even for…  CHEESE GRATERS!?!  If you think I'll let go for a little…  EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION?!?!?!?! OH, NOOO!!!!",not spongebob,0
Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes.,not spongebob,0
And now back to K.R.U.D. with all of your personal you won't get away with stealing my car! hits!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look.",not spongebob,0
"I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were…  … Mrs. Puff!?!  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.",not spongebob,0
"So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?",not spongebob,0
I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.,not spongebob,0
"You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
Free driving lessons!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"What are you doing out here, silly?",spongebob,1
"I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away!  Oh, barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!",not spongebob,0
"That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work.",spongebob,1
Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?,not spongebob,0
"I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy.",spongebob,1
"Ugh! I hate that hat!  Fine, have it your way, hat!  Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Oh no! He's got the hat, too!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then.",spongebob,1
"I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad! What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy.  Eh? That sounds like... a band of roving tourists!  Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day?  What are you doing there, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Standin' around out here all day.,not spongebob,0
"How would you like a job, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
"Oh boy, gimme my hat!",not spongebob,0
"You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign.  That's not too tough for ya, is it, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat.  How's this?",not spongebob,0
Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all.  Hee hee hee.,not spongebob,0
"What's shakin', Mr. K?",spongebob,1
"Your buddy, Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he is good.",spongebob,1
And look. He's about reel in his first customer.,not spongebob,0
Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please?,not spongebob,0
"What does he think he's doing?!  They're walkin' right past him!  Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something?  Just keep workin' on that one, eh, boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl?",not spongebob,0
Anything for my new hat.,not spongebob,0
"That's enough, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"I did it! Did you see that, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
I saw it.,not spongebob,0
Do I get my hat now?,not spongebob,0
What the heck. It pays to advertise.,not spongebob,0
My hat...,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?",not spongebob,0
"What's the matter, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I dunno. Sometimes, when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand.",not spongebob,0
He's nervous.,spongebob,1
Ha ha ha! Look at that guy! He doesn't know how stand on his own two feet!,not spongebob,0
Now that's that kind of mindlessness I'd pay money to see!,not spongebob,0
"You mean, cash money?",not spongebob,0
"Well, heck, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Five dollars please. All right!,not spongebob,0
"There's that sound again! They're loving it! Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous flapdoodle!",not spongebob,0
I did?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, I think we've finally found a job you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab! For just five dollars a head.",not spongebob,0
"It's official.  I hate everyone.  You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Well, brace yourselves for some true entertainment!",not spongebob,0
Patrick.,spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
Are you okay?,spongebob,1
I'm fine.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that horrible noise! Let's get out of here!",not spongebob,0
What the barnacles is going on out here?!,not spongebob,0
I'm entertaining these heathens.,not spongebob,0
"We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much!  Where'd he go?",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. Easy now. Right this way.",spongebob,1
What in the name of Neptune is going on here?!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home.",spongebob,1
"Oh, a bloody nose, eh? You think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now get back to work, the all of ya's! I'm not running a happy factory here!  Keep up the good work, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. K!",not spongebob,0
7 hours later...,not spongebob,0
That guy still flopping?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Amazing, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
Doesn't that get old?,not spongebob,0
He's got a point. Let's get out of here.,not spongebob,0
"Me, too. I'm out.",not spongebob,0
What? Wait! Don't go! Why ya leaving?,not spongebob,0
This guy's act is stale! We crave excitement!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay! You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box?",not spongebob,0
"Sort of the same, really.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, okay, so what if he flopped from two boxes...?  ...into a cream pie?",not spongebob,0
I like pie.,not spongebob,0
"That, I'd pay to see!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boy, let 'er rip!  I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!",not spongebob,0
Whatever.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hat man... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?",spongebob,1
I feel like a million bucks...,not spongebob,0
"Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something!  Okay, that's it! No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck! I'm gonna go have a talk with him right-",spongebob,1
"No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years, people have been telling me, “You're no good!” Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing.",spongebob,1
"What's that, pal?",not spongebob,0
Just be careful.,spongebob,1
"Thanks, pal.",not spongebob,0
I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him.,spongebob,1
See the part time minimum wage employee fall from high atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins!,not spongebob,0
This should be good.,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!",spongebob,1
"It's okay, boy, he signed a waiver.  Is he ready, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Ready!,not spongebob,0
"Okay! Step back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, good idea. Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt?  Thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Ready, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Ready!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I can't watch!",spongebob,1
"Hey, ew!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!",not spongebob,0
I'm trying!,not spongebob,0
"Argh, I think I'm stuck!",not spongebob,0
"Stuck? Well, if that don't …  What's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, why have you stopped falling?",not spongebob,0
"I dunno, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you'd better figure it out! These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation! Now make with the codswallop, pal, understand?",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
Don't make me come back here.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know …",not spongebob,0
"You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. Okay, I'll do it!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat! Gotcha! All right, back where you belong, aaaah! .",not spongebob,0
"Great, we get to see two for the price of one!",not spongebob,0
I don't think so.,not spongebob,0
Fine.,not spongebob,0
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Squidward, I'm falling!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm so happy for you!",not spongebob,0
"I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!",not spongebob,0
So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!,spongebob,1
I paid to see two guys get maimed!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I want a refund!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, absolutely no refunds.  Hold on there, what's the big idea?  Grandma, help!  All right, you leave me no choice!",not spongebob,0
You're giving me a raise?,not spongebob,0
"Not even close. You're fired.  As long as I'm still standing, you’ll never wear this hat again.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you okay?",spongebob,1
"Well, I guess it's back to being to No Hat Pat!",not spongebob,0
Epilogue.,not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want.",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, pal.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!",not spongebob,0
"Anytime, pal! Anytime!",spongebob,1
"I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well, at least my flowers survived the trip.  SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff?!",not spongebob,0
"What about Patrick? Does he have to find his own flowers, too?",spongebob,1
"What are you talking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!",not spongebob,0
"Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my...  ...face?  You're right, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"My floors! Think fast, Squiddy. I've got your nose.",not spongebob,0
You do?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. I've got it...  ...right here.,not spongebob,0
Give me! Give it here!,not spongebob,0
"If you want it, you gotta go get it.",not spongebob,0
"There!  Well, SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's not a nose, that's a...  ...hermit crab.",spongebob,1
I guess I'll always be a noseless freak.,not spongebob,0
It's not so abnormal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
There you are!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face?",spongebob,1
I can do that?,not spongebob,0
"Well, what do you think?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, doc. I don't really think it's me.",not spongebob,0
"That's a-okay. That's cool. As lead surgeon here, I take a hypothetical oath. Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satisfied! So please, browse our extensive wall of noses! And I will patiently await your final decision.",not spongebob,0
Okay! Let's see. Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Excellent choice!,not spongebob,0
"All right, Patrick, let's unveil the new schnoze!",spongebob,1
"Wait, stop, careful, SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages.",not spongebob,0
"There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy!  Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.",spongebob,1
"I will! Now, how do I use this thing?  What is that smell?  Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I won't be eating those.",not spongebob,0
Let's see Patrick destroy these.,not spongebob,0
"All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!  What is that horrible smell?  Onion rings?  The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells!  What is it now?  I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing.  I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors.  Bad smells are all around me!  I cannot live in these conditions!",not spongebob,0
48 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Hiya, Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good.",spongebob,1
"Oh, the smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable!",not spongebob,0
What's wrong with the pinhead?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's another one! No! I can't take it!",not spongebob,0
Where do you think you're going?,not spongebob,0
"To do what should have been done long ago. , then screams] Sweet Neptune, imported cheese!  This is inexcusable!  Yuck!",not spongebob,0
What are you doing with my cheese?,not spongebob,0
It's rotten garbage now.  That's better.,not spongebob,0
"That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!",not spongebob,0
"You are sick, Squidward.  Bad smell again!",not spongebob,0
"1, 2, 3, 4...  Come on, SquarePants, be a man!",spongebob,1
You!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, help!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll help you, all right! Help stop you from polluting our world with your sweaty holes.  There.",not spongebob,0
I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.,spongebob,1
"Well, you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob.  Smells like... something greasy.  Nobody moves! I am ridding this place of its disgusting stench with these scented candles!",not spongebob,0
My mouth can't take these conflicting flavors! Agh!,not spongebob,0
This air freshener should finish the job.,not spongebob,0
What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers!,not spongebob,0
"Well, good! No one should have to eat in this stench!",not spongebob,0
"What?! Why, I got a good mind to...",not spongebob,0
"Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got many more stink holes to swab clean.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk!",not spongebob,0
"Hiya, Pat.",not spongebob,0
"Take a bath, fleabag!",not spongebob,0
I've asked you all here because we all face a similar problem. The problem bein' a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand!,not spongebob,0
"You got that right, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it!?",not spongebob,0
"You bet we're gonna do, yeah!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure are!",not spongebob,0
Let's give him what for!,not spongebob,0
Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, SpongeBob, be a man!  Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public listen! That no-good, nose-flartin...",not spongebob,0
It is not Patrick's fault!,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!  Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom.  With a little raw sewage for good measure.",spongebob,1
Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
Hello.  No!  All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you.,not spongebob,0
"Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. R.I.P.  Well, this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it.",spongebob,1
Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone.,not spongebob,0
I heard that!,not spongebob,0
Ooh... What the...  ...now?,not spongebob,0
"La, la, la...  La-la-la, la, la-la-la...",spongebob,1
Stop!  What could you possibly be trying to do this time?,not spongebob,0
I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning.,spongebob,1
By running around and screaming like a banshee?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this:  Ahhhhhhh...",spongebob,1
There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal.  And then there's you.,not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"Yes, really! Maybe you should start acting a little more... normal!!  Doh...",not spongebob,0
I'm not normal?  Squidward?  How does one become normal?,spongebob,1
"Well, how about you start by...  Getting away from me, you little creature!",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal!  How to be Normal. Hm, this videotape should help.",spongebob,1
"Are you tired of being called a freak? Do people throw you out of their homes? Well, do they?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes, and yes.",spongebob,1
"Then join me, as I take you on a Journey into Normality.",not spongebob,0
Normality.,spongebob,1
"The life of a normal person is rather simple.  Here is your typical average Joe on his way to work. See how he is dressed.  Even his hair is boring.  Notice his features, nice and smooth without a crater or freckle to be seen.",not spongebob,0
Craters and freckles?,spongebob,1
"In his office space, Mr. Normal, at least that's what it says on his name tag, works at a steady and monotonous pace, just as all the other normals do. Take note of how they communicate with each other.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, how are you?",not spongebob,0
"At the end of the day, Mr. Normal packs his things and goes home to merrily start the cycle again in the morning.",not spongebob,0
Yeah...,spongebob,1
I want one Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.  What, no annoying blurbs today?  Hmm, strangely quiet.  SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Hi, how are ya.",spongebob,1
What's the meaning of this?,not spongebob,0
"I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal.",spongebob,1
"Normal, huh?",not spongebob,0
Yup.,spongebob,1
"Oh, really?",not spongebob,0
Yup.,spongebob,1
Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid.,not spongebob,0
Wonderful weather we're having.,spongebob,1
"Uh, yes, it is.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, see ya 'round.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'll, uh...I'll see you.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally.",spongebob,1
"Eh?  Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more?  Oh, my! It's like printing money!",not spongebob,0
I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?!  Whose house is this?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, how are ya.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, how are ya.",spongebob,1
"Good, just heading by to get a drink.",not spongebob,0
Wonderful weather we're having.,spongebob,1
It sure is.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, see ya 'round.",spongebob,1
"Yeah...  See ya.  Oh, my.  I could get used to this.",not spongebob,0
TBD.,not spongebob,0
Three weeks later...,not spongebob,0
"There you are, sir.  Oh, yes, it's time again. I've been meaning to say this, but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately.",not spongebob,0
"You know, it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal.",spongebob,1
Ugh! That ain't right. I will never spend money here again.,not spongebob,0
Never?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, guys, these patties aren't worth the paper they're printed on.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads.",not spongebob,0
Maybe this thing is out of ink.,spongebob,1
"No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart into it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.",not spongebob,0
What you call dull I call normal.,spongebob,1
"Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can, I want you out of my place!",not spongebob,0
"I guess the decision to be normal was more life-changing than I thought.  Hi, how are ya.",spongebob,1
What happened to you?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I got normal.",spongebob,1
"Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets ablaze?",not spongebob,0
"Let's do something normal, like window shopping.",spongebob,1
"Let's do this...  Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.",not spongebob,0
"I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?",spongebob,1
"Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun, you know where to find me.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, see ya 'round.  Hi, how are ya.",spongebob,1
"I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but please come in, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.",spongebob,1
"Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.",spongebob,1
"You know, SpongeBob, it's okay to be a little different.",not spongebob,0
"And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go.  See? Looking normal already.",spongebob,1
What the...?,not spongebob,0
"One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants.",spongebob,1
And stay out of my home!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what happened? I lost my job, then my best friend, and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus...  and clench.  Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional.",spongebob,1
Look at the tongue.,not spongebob,0
"That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.",spongebob,1
"Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.",not spongebob,0
"Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me again.",spongebob,1
"It won't be easy, but I'll do it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck, and I'll need you to remove your trousers.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.",spongebob,1
"Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"Mommy, mommy... what are those things?",not spongebob,0
"Those are undesirables, honey. We only talk to normal people!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger.  Talk backwards.",not spongebob,0
Tap erus uoy era?,spongebob,1
It's happening. The final transformation.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
What happened?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
I don't wanna be normal!,spongebob,1
Go away!,not spongebob,0
Normal is not worth it!,spongebob,1
We're in mourning!,not spongebob,0
"It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob.  Hi. How are ya?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.",spongebob,1
"Wonderful weather we're having, hm?",not spongebob,0
"It sure is, buddy. It sure is.",spongebob,1
"Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea.",not spongebob,0
"Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?",not spongebob,0
"Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, are you ready?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi...",spongebob,1
"Hi-yah!  Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.",not spongebob,0
"Great minds think alike, I suppose.",spongebob,1
Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
"I may be down, but I'm not out!",spongebob,1
"Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad.  Three days!",not spongebob,0
Hi-yah! Sandy?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm Sandy, alright.  I'm very Sandy.  Hi-yah!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it. She's Sandy. That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!",spongebob,1
"Back in Texas, we call ice cream frozen cow juice. Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah!  Thank you.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, thank you.",not spongebob,0
Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
Who threw that piece of paper at me?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon —  the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles.  You need to have muscles on your muscles.  You need to have muscles on your eyeballs!",not spongebob,0
Ew.,spongebob,1
"Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, let's go in.",spongebob,1
Go ahead.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?,not spongebob,0
How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, so?",not spongebob,0
Without any milk.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?",not spongebob,0
How tough am I?,not spongebob,0
Wow.,spongebob,1
Got any more tattoos?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
How tough are ya?,not spongebob,0
How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?,spongebob,1
Sure.,not spongebob,0
It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...,spongebob,1
"Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.",not spongebob,0
"Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.",spongebob,1
"Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place.",not spongebob,0
Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?,spongebob,1
"Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it.",not spongebob,0
Super Weenie Hut Jr's?,spongebob,1
Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me.,not spongebob,0
How's your collection coming along?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.",not spongebob,0
No...,not spongebob,0
"What weenies. Oh, brother.",spongebob,1
"Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?",not spongebob,0
What? But I'm not a weenie!,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie.",not spongebob,0
That's impossible!,spongebob,1
You can't hide what's inside.,not spongebob,0
I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Reg, how's it going?",not spongebob,0
"You were sayin'?  Go ahead, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Reg.",not spongebob,0
"So, your name's Reg?",spongebob,1
Would you get outta here?,not spongebob,0
"Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!",spongebob,1
"Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.",not spongebob,0
"I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.",not spongebob,0
"I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed.  Hey, where'd he go?",not spongebob,0
I believe he said something about going to the wig store.,not spongebob,0
Ha-ha! Check and mate.,not spongebob,0
"What's shakin', my man?",not spongebob,0
"Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?",not spongebob,0
"Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, kid. I know it's you.",not spongebob,0
What're you talking about?,not spongebob,0
Aha!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?",spongebob,1
"Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that.  Well, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
"I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?",spongebob,1
"Hey-ya, Reg.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Hey, what about that one?",not spongebob,0
"Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.",not spongebob,0
Can you make it dance?,not spongebob,0
"Well, here, let me try.",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, wait a minute.  Go ahead in.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, little man.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I was in front of you!",not spongebob,0
"No, you weren't!",not spongebob,0
You callin' me a liar?,not spongebob,0
I ain't callin' you for dinner!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.",not spongebob,0
Alright!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Reg.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.",spongebob,1
"I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.",not spongebob,0
"Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch.",spongebob,1
"Care for another sundae, weenie?",not spongebob,0
I am not a weenie!,spongebob,1
"Relax, you're among friends.",not spongebob,0
My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.,spongebob,1
"You tell 'em, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what're you doing here?",spongebob,1
I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.,not spongebob,0
"Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.",not spongebob,0
"And besides, today's Monday.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, that's now on Sunday.",not spongebob,0
Barnacles!,not spongebob,0
Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.",not spongebob,0
I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon!,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.",not spongebob,0
I've got no choice.,spongebob,1
I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?",not spongebob,0
"I am a robot, not a miracle worker.",not spongebob,0
"Afternoon, Reg.",spongebob,1
"Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that makes me pretty mad.",spongebob,1
Oh yeah?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.,spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.",spongebob,1
Hmmm... what about that guy?,not spongebob,0
"I, uh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!",spongebob,1
"Who, me?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!",spongebob,1
"Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kickboxer.",not spongebob,0
"I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!",spongebob,1
Tubby?  Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah.  No, please wait.  No, please, have mercy!",not spongebob,0
Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him.,not spongebob,0
I did?,spongebob,1
"I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.",not spongebob,0
"Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?",spongebob,1
You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube.,not spongebob,0
What happened?,not spongebob,0
I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.,spongebob,1
"Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital.",not spongebob,0
Weenie Hut General?,spongebob,1
It's too high. I can't!,not spongebob,0
Cannonball!,not spongebob,0
Ohh!,not spongebob,0
Now you've got water wings. Try them.  Hmm? Huh?,not spongebob,0
Ahh-ahh-ahh!,not spongebob,0
Marco!,spongebob,1
Ehh.,not spongebob,0
Marco?,spongebob,1
"No, I'm Joshua.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, bye.  Marco.",spongebob,1
Polo.,not spongebob,0
Marco!,spongebob,1
"Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!",not spongebob,0
I pooped.,not spongebob,0
"Come along, Mortimer.",not spongebob,0
Huh?  Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies.  Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today.",not spongebob,0
"Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh!  Wait for me!",not spongebob,0
Marco! Marco!  Marco?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick.",spongebob,1
Then stop a-yellin' my name!,not spongebob,0
Ugh.  Marco.,spongebob,1
"Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him?",not spongebob,0
"Come on, let's move it! I want prune ice cream.",not spongebob,0
Ohh.,not spongebob,0
"Mortimer, ice cream time.",not spongebob,0
Ahh!  Brain freeze!,not spongebob,0
Clear!  Clear!,not spongebob,0
Oh.  Ah.  Brain food.,not spongebob,0
Eh?,not spongebob,0
Ehh?,not spongebob,0
Eh.  Oh.,not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
Marco!,spongebob,1
Marco!,spongebob,1
You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?,not spongebob,0
"Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance.  I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?",spongebob,1
My parents had a white farmhouse.,not spongebob,0
What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.,spongebob,1
That's-a me. I was-a born there.,not spongebob,0
They are about to name the boy...,spongebob,1
Marco. They named him Marco. It's Marco. Marco!,not spongebob,0
Polo.,spongebob,1
"Ahh!  If I catch anyone a-yellin' my name again, I'm-a gonna hurt them.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!  Marco.,spongebob,1
Polo.,not spongebob,0
Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.,spongebob,1
"Do I know you, young man?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪",spongebob,1
I don't know. A wizard?,not spongebob,0
♪Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪  Ehh.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob SquarePants!,not spongebob,0
"The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo.",spongebob,1
"Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff.",not spongebob,0
Old stuff? Like what?,spongebob,1
"Check it out.  This is called doddering.  Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming.  Neat, huh?  Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining.  These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing?",spongebob,1
"Ohh! No, that hurts.",not spongebob,0
We could build sandcastles.,spongebob,1
It's not structurally sound.,not spongebob,0
"Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles?  Nothing bad about a bubble.",spongebob,1
"Ooh.  Are you trying to kill me, son?",not spongebob,0
"No, I just think we should act our age.  Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?",spongebob,1
"These days, I only look forward to my final exit.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he was too young.",not spongebob,0
"No, I wasn't!",not spongebob,0
"No, he wasn't.  We are not young.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh.",spongebob,1
"Fresh, you say? Ahh.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree.",spongebob,1
"Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!",spongebob,1
Is it nap time yet?,not spongebob,0
Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.,spongebob,1
Are you ready to get down?,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"No, not like that. Like this!",spongebob,1
Now-now-now-now you're talking.,not spongebob,0
"Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches!  Yeah!",spongebob,1
"Oh, what's happening?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, clear!",spongebob,1
Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?,spongebob,1
Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!,not spongebob,0
Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!,not spongebob,0
"Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease, and sugar.",spongebob,1
You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams!  Now that's what I call jazz!,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this.",spongebob,1
I can help you with that.  Eww.,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Old people, behave!",spongebob,1
Whoa!  23 skidoo!,not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  I'm drowning!,not spongebob,0
"I'm coming, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Thanks, old-timer.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer?  Whoa. Where have the years gone?  I'm losing steam.",spongebob,1
"Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends.  Oh.  Ohh. Now I can't dodder.",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, old friend.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,spongebob,1
You got me again.,not spongebob,0
Marco.,not spongebob,0
Polo.,not spongebob,0
Marco!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!",not spongebob,0
"No one clobbers Clarabelle!  Oh, Marco?",not spongebob,0
Polo.,not spongebob,0
What a sun-tastic day!  Snail trail.  That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Not my pet rock collection.  That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time!  This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe.  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob...  Keep your shelled vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster...  He bit me!",not spongebob,0
"Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you.",spongebob,1
"Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mollusk.",not spongebob,0
Gary's not misbehaved!,spongebob,1
But there does appear to be something wrong with him.,spongebob,1
I'll say. I hope he had his shots.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course.",spongebob,1
All of his shots?,not spongebob,0
Affirmatory.,spongebob,1
For rabies?,not spongebob,0
Yup.,spongebob,1
Snail pox and soft shell dance?,not spongebob,0
Yupie.,spongebob,1
"Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?",not spongebob,0
"Yup, yup, yup.",spongebob,1
"Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.",not spongebob,0
Uhh...,spongebob,1
You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?  Looks like the rash has already started.,not spongebob,0
Rash?,not spongebob,0
"Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?",not spongebob,0
"Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.",not spongebob,0
"This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance...",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Messy pants,  ticklish rib cage,  severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail  will turn you into... A zombie.",not spongebob,0
You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important.  There's a mad snail on the loose!,not spongebob,0
Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!,spongebob,1
"The mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.",not spongebob,0
"Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics?",not spongebob,0
"Oh look, honey, isn't he the cutest?",not spongebob,0
"Come here, little buddy.  He's just adorable.  Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!",not spongebob,0
"Then I've got it! A snail just bit me, too!",not spongebob,0
"We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a news blast. Terror in a shell. This just in... fear and disease are spreading like wildfire as a killer snail has been biting the denizens of Bikini Bottom infecting them with... mad snail disease.  Ask any old fish on the street and they'll tell you that germs enter through the bite radius, traveling upstream until the entire host body is full of... mad snail disease.  We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene.",not spongebob,0
"Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic. Tell me Mr Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?",not spongebob,0
"Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance.  Whoa.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too. And I haven't even been bitten.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, it's spreading through the air!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise. Thanks to a diseased snail.",not spongebob,0
Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.,spongebob,1
I'm a zombie... here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh!  It's locked!  Somebody let me in.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry.",not spongebob,0
Stop! You can't let anyone in!,not spongebob,0
But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.,not spongebob,0
"Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.",not spongebob,0
I don't work here.,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?,not spongebob,0
Could a voracious flesh-eater do this?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, it's you.",not spongebob,0
That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.",not spongebob,0
Or is it?,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombified. Just look at how yellow he is.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet?",spongebob,1
"Perhaps not, but I got my eye on you!",not spongebob,0
"If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... You a zombie too?",not spongebob,0
You're right.  I'm a zombie!,not spongebob,0
Who's to say we're not all zombies?!,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
The snail!,not spongebob,0
"Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.",spongebob,1
"No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!",not spongebob,0
I can't watch.,not spongebob,0
All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail.  Gary...  How could you?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
No! Don't hurt him!,spongebob,1
Hand over the snail!,not spongebob,0
"It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
No! I won't let you touch Gary!,spongebob,1
"Stop the madness, man! The Mad Snail Disease ends now! Seize the snail!",not spongebob,0
Halt! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this fuss is about?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. What do you know about it?,not spongebob,0
Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.,not spongebob,0
S.D.E. and S.E.?,spongebob,1
"Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.,not spongebob,0
"Well, does that mean we're not zombies?",not spongebob,0
Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.,not spongebob,0
But what about my severely untrimmed...,not spongebob,0
Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.,not spongebob,0
"Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?",spongebob,1
Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot.  I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?",not spongebob,0
All's well that ends well.,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, that's the stuff.  Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?",not spongebob,0
Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.,spongebob,1
Explosive!?,not spongebob,0
"Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene!",not spongebob,0
Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!,not spongebob,0
You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!,not spongebob,0
"Ready ammunition!  Fire!  Take cover!  Oh, ha, ha, it didn't go off! Another dud, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"A dud, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and I’ll be on my way.",not spongebob,0
Well you ain't getting it.,not spongebob,0
I implore you to reconsider.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, go jump off a plank.",not spongebob,0
"I have ways of getting the information I need. Where’s the formula, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
Ha ha ha ha!,not spongebob,0
"Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs?  OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.",not spongebob,0
I'll never talk.,spongebob,1
We’ll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.,not spongebob,0
"OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!",spongebob,1
"Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?",not spongebob,0
Errrrrrrr...,not spongebob,0
Say what am I smelling? You got something burning?,not spongebob,0
Smells like blubber to me.,spongebob,1
Bl bl blubber?,not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!,not spongebob,0
"She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.",not spongebob,0
Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries!,not spongebob,0
Did he just go into the freezer?,not spongebob,0
Don't say it!,not spongebob,0
I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.,not spongebob,0
"Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formular, now get us out of this trap.",not spongebob,0
Mall money.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. . Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?",not spongebob,0
Double my mall money!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.",spongebob,1
"Hey, this isn't money!",not spongebob,0
"No, it's even better! This is what Mr. Krabs pays me with.  Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's all catching up to me...  Please, Pearl? I'll do your homework for ya.",not spongebob,0
"No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm... in that case, Pearl, I'm gonna need to borrow one of your dressers.",not spongebob,0
Hummina-hunh?/Huh?!,not spongebob,0
My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?,not spongebob,0
Krabs had a whale!,not spongebob,0
"You mean his big, bad, scary teenage daughter?",not spongebob,0
"I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?",not spongebob,0
"OK, when you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.",not spongebob,0
I'm hungry!,not spongebob,0
That should keep her out!,not spongebob,0
I want plankton meat!,not spongebob,0
"Holy protozoa!  Karen, she's here! She got in!",not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
There's a whale in the laboratory!,not spongebob,0
Are you out of your mind?,not spongebob,0
See for yourself!,not spongebob,0
No whale in here.,not spongebob,0
"I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's enough, Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions.",not spongebob,0
Karen! Karen--!,not spongebob,0
I'm not listening!,not spongebob,0
16 paranoia filled days later...,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I can hear you. Can you bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me.",not spongebob,0
Hey! Get me out of here!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!",not spongebob,0
Grand-Dad?,not spongebob,0
"Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.",not spongebob,0
Gastric acid? ],not spongebob,0
,not spongebob,0
"I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy!",not spongebob,0
What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be along any time now.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?",spongebob,1
"Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.",spongebob,1
"Forget it, kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Goodbye, pipsqueak!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.",spongebob,1
Really? He's a mess!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?",spongebob,1
"May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?",not spongebob,0
"No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.",spongebob,1
"Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Plankton.",spongebob,1
What do you got? Mud in your ears? Take a hike!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
Why should I care? All meaning has left my life ever since I've been plagued by that blasted whale.,not spongebob,0
"It's okay. Everybody has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is...",spongebob,1
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of.",spongebob,1
You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottom feeder!,not spongebob,0
"But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?",spongebob,1
"No, of course not.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!",spongebob,1
"No, thank you!",not spongebob,0
This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, is that so?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!",not spongebob,0
"You don't scare me, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!",not spongebob,0
Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?,not spongebob,0
See for yourself.  Enjoy the show!,not spongebob,0
No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!,not spongebob,0
"Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, does it scaredy pants? (laughs) I am loving this.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.",spongebob,1
Why not?,not spongebob,0
Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding.,spongebob,1
Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here!,not spongebob,0
"Whew! Well, you redeemed yourself, boy.   Okay, you really are creeping me out now.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: One man's trash is another man's treasure.",not spongebob,0
Disposable? Phooey.,not spongebob,0
"For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure.",not spongebob,0
Open for business.  See anything you like?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella.",not spongebob,0
A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.,not spongebob,0
Ten bucks?  It's full of holes!,not spongebob,0
It was the queen of Switzerland.,not spongebob,0
A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second! They don't have a queen!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.",not spongebob,0
Deal!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker.",not spongebob,0
"They taste even better.  Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Whatcha you doing?,not spongebob,0
I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?",spongebob,1
That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.,not spongebob,0
"That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh...  ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?",not spongebob,0
"Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?",not spongebob,0
Five bucks.,not spongebob,0
I only got seven.,not spongebob,0
Deal.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper.",not spongebob,0
Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.,spongebob,1
"That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"This hat says, Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking. This hat was made for you, boy.  You were born to wear this hat.",not spongebob,0
"Ee-hee, ooh...!",spongebob,1
"A perfect fit, eh, son?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together!  How can I ever repay you?",spongebob,1
With 10 dollars.,not spongebob,0
All I have is 5.,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess it's no deal.",not spongebob,0
"I'll be right back.  Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?",spongebob,1
"Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Don't mention it, boys.  What a couple of rubes.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I am.",not spongebob,0
I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat.,not spongebob,0
Fresh out.,not spongebob,0
Let me explain.  I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.,not spongebob,0
Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...,not spongebob,0
Not so fast.  I'll give you $1000 for such a hat.,not spongebob,0
"I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat.",not spongebob,0
Sir? I'll give you a million dollars for that hat!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.,not spongebob,0
"Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?",spongebob,1
"Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.",not spongebob,0
Am I a pretty girl?,spongebob,1
"Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through.  Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.",spongebob,1
"Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.",not spongebob,0
I'm not?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?",not spongebob,0
Yep.,spongebob,1
"Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?",not spongebob,0
Nope.,spongebob,1
Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?,not spongebob,0
Uh-uh.,spongebob,1
Not even a teensy-tiny bit?,not spongebob,0
Nope.,spongebob,1
"Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.",not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
Novelty hats.  How about this air-condition one?,not spongebob,0
Seems a little dangerous.,spongebob,1
The juicer.,not spongebob,0
Ooh...,spongebob,1
"Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?",not spongebob,0
"No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.",spongebob,1
"I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option.  I'm gonna have to scare it off of him.   Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare 'im.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list!",spongebob,1
I'm not a shopping list...  I'm a ghost!,not spongebob,0
"Now, listen, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
How do you know my name?! Who are you?!,spongebob,1
I am the ghost of soda drink hats.  I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.,not spongebob,0
Cursed?,spongebob,1

What guy?,spongebob,1
Uh... Smitty something.,not spongebob,0
Smitty what?,spongebob,1
Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.,not spongebob,0
He must've been number one.,spongebob,1
"Number one in Boogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.",not spongebob,0
Immediately?,spongebob,1
Immediately...,not spongebob,0
To its owner?,spongebob,1

Right now?,spongebob,1
"Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.,spongebob,1
What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!,not spongebob,0
Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.,spongebob,1
How did? I just... You did... I would... Gimme that shovel.,not spongebob,0
"It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1!",spongebob,1
"Huh?  Ahh!  Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams. What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh. No. No. Uh-uh. No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue.",not spongebob,0
"Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets.",spongebob,1
"No, not that!",not spongebob,0
"You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess!",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, no!",not spongebob,0
"It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-",spongebob,1
"Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.",not spongebob,0
"What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.",not spongebob,0
I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, right. You and what army?",not spongebob,0
Only the army of the living dead.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.",not spongebob,0
That's disgusting! We just want the hat back.,not spongebob,0
"No flipping way!  Back off! Back off, I say.",not spongebob,0
Attack.,not spongebob,0
"Tallyho!  Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!  You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding.  Back to oblivion.  Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha!  Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars!  Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, you want that all at once?",not spongebob,0
One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!,not spongebob,0
Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless.,not spongebob,0
Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand.,spongebob,1
"Now that's worth a million dollars.  Hey, kid, wait up!",not spongebob,0
I saw him first!,not spongebob,0
I'll give you one billion dollars!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a spirit breaker.",not spongebob,0
What a baby.,not spongebob,0
Ta-daaa!  I did it! I did it! I did it! I did-,spongebob,1

"If he thinks I'm out, he'll go away.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! I'm so glad you're home. Got a magic trick to show ya!,spongebob,1
I hate magic.,not spongebob,0
How could anyone hate magic? It's...  ...magical.,spongebob,1
"Okay, show me the trick.",not spongebob,0
"Pick a card- oh.  Watch closely, Squidward. The hand is quicker than the eye.",spongebob,1
Can't watch. No eyes. Sorry.,not spongebob,0
I want to show my trick to somebody.,spongebob,1
"You're the best driving student I've ever had, Rodger. Kudos.",not spongebob,0

"Oh, sorry, SpongeBob, didn't mean to spook ya. My head's in another dimension, observing.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, okay, I'll come back later when you have a head.",spongebob,1
It should be back by Thursday. Friday at the latest.,not spongebob,0
Who is it?,not spongebob,0
"Pick a card, any card!",spongebob,1
"Magic, eh, boyo?  Is this by any chance a trick where you produce money coins from behind people's ears?  Wink wink, hmm?",not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
Then what's the point?,not spongebob,0
"Ah! ] Hi, Fred!  I've got a magic trick that's going to dazzle you!",spongebob,1
"Ooh! Are you going to saw my leg in half, or make it disappear, or pull a rabbit out of it?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, this isn't going to involve your leg.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, gotta go, SpongeBob. I'm washing my thighs tonight.  My leg!",not spongebob,0
"Why won't anyone watch my trick?!   Hey, that gives me an idea!  There. Good evening, folks, I am the Great Spongedini! Now watch closely,  the hand is quicker than the eye. Pick a card. Any card.",spongebob,1

"Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.",spongebob,1
Another year older.,not spongebob,0
It's not my birthday!  That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!,not spongebob,0
"Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles!  I can sell your home in a heartbeat.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.",not spongebob,0
"No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.",not spongebob,0
"Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say neighbors?",not spongebob,0
Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.,not spongebob,0
Neighbors. Uhh...,not spongebob,0
"Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite...",not spongebob,0
"Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?",spongebob,1
"Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!",not spongebob,0
Squidward! You need bed rest!  I'll keep you safe until you're well again.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Wednesday?",spongebob,1
"Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!",not spongebob,0
Does everybody know about Opposite Day?,spongebob,1
Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a game.",spongebob,1
"Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?",not spongebob,0
Quiet and out of the way! Yay!,spongebob,1
Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.,not spongebob,0
"I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!",spongebob,1
"So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"Gary! It's Opposite Day and I...  ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day.  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?",spongebob,1

Company! I hate company. ‘’’’Who's there?,spongebob,1
It's Patrick!,not spongebob,0
Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!,not spongebob,0

"Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!",not spongebob,0
You have?,spongebob,1
No! What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.",spongebob,1

"Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day...  ...terrible?",spongebob,1
I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!,not spongebob,0
Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!,spongebob,1
"If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house!",not spongebob,0
Isn't it beautiful?,not spongebob,0
On Opposite Day it is.,spongebob,1
"Out of the way, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better.  Now you try.",spongebob,1
"Okay.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"After you, Mr. Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!",not spongebob,0
"Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person!  Hello, Mr...  Uh... Mr. Tentacles?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, please come in.",spongebob,1
"It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, everyone says that.",spongebob,1
"Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.",not spongebob,0
"Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.",spongebob,1
"Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.",not spongebob,0
"Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?",spongebob,1
"Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...",not spongebob,0
Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.,spongebob,1
"Oh my, this painting is very nice.",not spongebob,0
Thank you!,not spongebob,0
Who's that?!,not spongebob,0
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.,spongebob,1
You're both Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.",spongebob,1
We're both Squidward.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
"I really don't want to hear more, thank you.",not spongebob,0
I hear you loud and clear.,spongebob,1
"Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two  barnacle heads  haven't harmed you in any way.",not spongebob,0
Who are you?,not spongebob,0
"Why, I'm Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"What kind of fool do you take me for?  He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward... I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
I'm outta here.,not spongebob,0
"Ma'am, please! What about my house?!",not spongebob,0
I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on Earth!,not spongebob,0
Wait!,not spongebob,0
Don't...,spongebob,1
...Go!,not spongebob,0
No! No! No! No! No!,not spongebob,0
Stop! Stop!,not spongebob,0
"Please, sell my house!",not spongebob,0
Never!,not spongebob,0
Don't leave me here!,not spongebob,0
"Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you!",not spongebob,0
Let me show you guys how much I... hate you!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?!",spongebob,1
Happy Opposite Day!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? . SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low.  Why are you grilling index cards?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted.  I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow.",spongebob,1
"You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!",not spongebob,0
"Okay! Okay!  Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday.",spongebob,1
"No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes!  Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!",spongebob,1
Must I do everything myself?  Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn.,not spongebob,0
I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything.,spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry, wrong rock.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes.",spongebob,1
Okay.  Uhhh...,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here.  Just pretend you're a student at his desk.",spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, here goes.  Boating safety is...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?",not spongebob,0
"Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice.",spongebob,1
Fine.,not spongebob,0
Boating safe...,spongebob,1
Boring! Next!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?",spongebob,1
"All right, all right.",not spongebob,0
"So, without further ado...  Patrick?  Patrick, wake up.  What happened, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?,spongebob,1
Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.,not spongebob,0
Worse?,spongebob,1
You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.,not spongebob,0
Okay.  Boating safety...  Boating safe...,spongebob,1
That's it!  Fight through!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!",spongebob,1
Says you! Speech!,not spongebob,0
Boating safe...,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Young man, how dare you?!",not spongebob,0
"What, a detention slip?",spongebob,1
I'm not hearing your oral report.,not spongebob,0
Okay.  Boating safe...,spongebob,1
Try again.,not spongebob,0
Boating safety...,spongebob,1
"Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working.",spongebob,1
Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Spee -,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license!",spongebob,1
"Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!",not spongebob,0
It has been scientifically proven that  85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.,not spongebob,0
"Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these.  Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license.",not spongebob,0
That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working.,spongebob,1
"Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Eh! Ooh, they work.",spongebob,1
...and they were never heard from again.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have--  --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh.",not spongebob,0
"Go on, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?",not spongebob,0
Huh...?,spongebob,1
The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready!  I can do it.  Um...  Oh, no. Oh, no!",spongebob,1
What are you doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?",spongebob,1
No. Only if you want to pass this class!,not spongebob,0
"Okay.  Uh, my report...is on...  Heh! Must be last-minute jitters!  Patrick, where are those goggles?",spongebob,1
Right here. Let me polish them up for ya.  Here ya go.,not spongebob,0
Thanks!,spongebob,1
Hurry up!,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...",spongebob,1
"What's all this laughing about?  Well, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because --,spongebob,1
"Well, don't just stand there! Get on with it!",not spongebob,0
They're all staring!,spongebob,1
"Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait!  SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Get back here with my boat!,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?",not spongebob,0
"You said it, partner! My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, forget what I just said.",not spongebob,0
"Sponge, pull over!",not spongebob,0
I don't know how!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"All right, kid, what was that all about?",not spongebob,0
Don't you know anything about boating safety?,not spongebob,0
"Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do.  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--",spongebob,1
"Gee, kid.  That was beautiful.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.,not spongebob,0
Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?",not spongebob,0
Yes. Why?,not spongebob,0
"Under penal code 26-1 quote, The boating instructor is responsible--",not spongebob,0
--for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care.,spongebob,1
"Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am.",not spongebob,0
What?! Nooo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!",spongebob,1
"Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh!",not spongebob,0
"And, what are you lookin' at?",not spongebob,0
"Ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings!",not spongebob,0
"Um, excuse me, can I have some ketchup?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, look at my arts you dummy!",not spongebob,0
"I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings.",spongebob,1
Buy some important paintings. See me expose my exquisite suffering.,not spongebob,0
Hmph! These fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. I'll confront them with the power of my art!,not spongebob,0
Witness the beauty!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Larry! Get your salad on!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Larry! Get your art on!",not spongebob,0
Oh! My eyes! Ahh!  The pain!,not spongebob,0
I want a Krabby Meal!,not spongebob,0
How about some art to go with that?,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Run, baby, run!",not spongebob,0
That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!,not spongebob,0
Sure he will!  I just bought one.,spongebob,1
Holy shrimp! Why would you do that to yourself?,not spongebob,0
What do you mean? I love it.,spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice.",spongebob,1
I'm good.,not spongebob,0
Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!,not spongebob,0
But think about how valuable these paintings might become.,spongebob,1
Valuable? What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
"When art gets older,  it usually gets more expensive.  Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday.",spongebob,1
Millions?!  Out of me way! Here!  Gimme!  Give it here! This is mine now!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable.",not spongebob,0
I am a very important art appraiser and I say this so-called art will never be worth a penny.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Eugene H. Krabs does not— I'll lose money! There must be something I can do to make this art worth lots more cash!",not spongebob,0
Hmm...,not spongebob,0
I sold all my art? This tiny handful of coins has legitimized me!  Who wants the autograph of a real artiste?,not spongebob,0
"Well, paintings can become much more valuable when the artist is no longer with us. You know. Out of the picture.",not spongebob,0
"Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this.",not spongebob,0
Artist walking. Check me out.,not spongebob,0
"Check this out.  I have a delivery for ya, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
What? You can't be serious. An artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery.",spongebob,1
"No, Mr. Squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything.",not spongebob,0
"The arctic is so cold!  Come on, Squidward. You're a strong artist. You can do it!  No!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
Just getting some ice.  Fresh.  Need some help?  Whoa!,spongebob,1
Here's your food.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is cold! Perfect!",not spongebob,0
"Eeh, we'd better get you home.",spongebob,1
"Hello, is this the art appraiser? Just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, Squidward, is now out of the pict—  Wh—wh—wh—What the seahorse?!  Got another delivery for you, Squidward!  And only Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Your eyes are so pretty.,spongebob,1
"Next  stop,  Rock  Bottom!",not spongebob,0
"237 Rock Bottom. Oh, there it is! Oh, remember, Squidward, real artists embrace the unknown.  Uh, is anyone here?  I've got a delivery from the Krusty  Krab!",not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
What are we screaming about?,spongebob,1
Monsters!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends.",spongebob,1
"What's  up,  SpongeBob? Ha.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'm sure that Mr. Squidward is out of the picture for good. He will be missed. So, come on over and tell old Krabs how much money me paintings are worth.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha.  Squidward, delivery!",not spongebob,0
"Ha, this tickles.",spongebob,1
"Follow me, Mr. Squidward. I've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's more like it. Finally, some respect.",not spongebob,0
Into the rocket ya go!,not spongebob,0
Wait! Why do I need a rocket? Where is this delivery to?,not spongebob,0
Mars.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Delivery from the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
"Mmm! Yummy, yummy!",not spongebob,0
"Hmph. All this red. So garish. Ha, this dump needs a true artist touch.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"So, now that Squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings?",not spongebob,0
"Well, of course they're awful, but if the so-called artist is really out of the picture, then perhaps they're worth something.",not spongebob,0
"Really?  Oh, it's so complicated. These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, Squidward. Wherever he is.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Stay here and keep an eye on me investments.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that was disgusting. So, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke?",not spongebob,0
Ahem!  Hmph!,not spongebob,0
I have done everything I could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money!,not spongebob,0
"Run, Squidward, run!",spongebob,1
Hey! How about a little support here?,not spongebob,0
"Run, Mr. Krabs, run!",spongebob,1
But a little slower than Squidward.,spongebob,1
3 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
"Oh, get off of me!",not spongebob,0
"I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe.",spongebob,1
I'll never be safe!  Not until my paintings are gone!,not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!",spongebob,1
"True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!",spongebob,1
I...I can't do it! They're just too magnificent!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey! Get away from me paintings!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes! Now, this is true art!",not spongebob,0
What? Really?,not spongebob,0
So visceral! So dangerous!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, feel my art!",not spongebob,0
"Leave me paintings alone, you monster!",not spongebob,0
No! That was the most accelerating performance art I have ever seen!,not spongebob,0
"Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that.",spongebob,1
"Oh, don't be so provincial, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, stop trying to censor our money! I mean our art!",not spongebob,0
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!,not spongebob,0
"Whoo, boy! Hee, hee! So, how much ya gonna give me for all this? Ha, ha.",not spongebob,0
Nothing! Performance art is about the moment. You cannot put a price on it.,not spongebob,0
"What? Wait, come back here, you double-crossin'—",not spongebob,0
D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!,spongebob,1
Ah-ha!,not spongebob,0
And that is how I acquired this masterpiece.,not spongebob,0
I'm an artist.,not spongebob,0
I'm rich.,not spongebob,0
And I helped.,spongebob,1
"Welcome to SpongeBob's House Party, with your host, Patchy the Pirate. There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, get off my lawn! Party?  There ain't no party here. Go away!",not spongebob,0
"Bawk, come on in!",not spongebob,0
"Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?",not spongebob,0
"Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome!  Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? Gee, I sure hope he got his invitation.",not spongebob,0
"I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!",spongebob,1
Me neither.,not spongebob,0
"Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire.",spongebob,1
"Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?",not spongebob,0
"No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha! That's the spirit!",not spongebob,0
"Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!",not spongebob,0
Who dares to interrupt Neptune?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune.  He's king of the sea.  You kids having fun?  He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon?  You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see.",not spongebob,0
"Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!",spongebob,1
"Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42.",not spongebob,0
But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds.,spongebob,1
"Okay, so it's a $1.42.",not spongebob,0
"Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? Plan Your Own Party Kit? Hey Lou, how much?",spongebob,1
"For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave... right now.",not spongebob,0
"Let's see Gary, according to the Plan Your Own Party Kit, invitations are the first order of business.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success. Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.",spongebob,1
Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants?,not spongebob,0
"I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.",not spongebob,0
"Kindergarten, huh?  Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, Gary, this Plan Your Own Party Kit is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world!  My piñata!  Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  The Plan Your Own Party Kit suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good question Gary, but not to worry. The Plan Your Own Party Kit warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever!",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness.  Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.",not spongebob,0
Bawk! How tacky.,not spongebob,0
"It's a $40 value, Potty!  A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody, the band's here.",not spongebob,0
Band? What band?,not spongebob,0
"Bawk, the band I hired for the party.",not spongebob,0
"A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get?  Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?",not spongebob,0
They broke up years ago.,not spongebob,0
"Well, who else is there?",not spongebob,0
The Bird Brains!,not spongebob,0
Oh..,not spongebob,0
The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.,not spongebob,0
But they're just a bunch of birds.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Encino!",not spongebob,0
"Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh!  No, no, No! Stop the music!  Stop! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.",not spongebob,0
You mean we're fired?,not spongebob,0
"No.  Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword!  No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh!",not spongebob,0
"While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come!  Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00.  Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?",spongebob,1
Sure?,not spongebob,0
Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!,spongebob,1
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
"So, the punch okay?",spongebob,1
"Not bad, not bad.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, nice weather we're having.",spongebob,1
"It's been very mild, yes.",not spongebob,0
"Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Ahoy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.",spongebob,1
Don't mind if I do!,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!",spongebob,1
Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
"No, you dumb bunny, it says, Hello, my name is Patrick.",not spongebob,0
Nice to meet you Patrick.,not spongebob,0
"Good one, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Was he talking to me or you?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you made it!",spongebob,1
My cable's out.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that.",spongebob,1
"So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Not bad.,not spongebob,0
"I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!",spongebob,1
"Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!",not spongebob,0
This is lame.,not spongebob,0
"My card says, Discuss the philosophical nature of irony. What does yours say?",not spongebob,0
Nod politely.,not spongebob,0
"What does yours say, Plankton?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!",spongebob,1
"Hey, hey!",not spongebob,0
"Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously.",spongebob,1
"(television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages.   Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Gare, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to  work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?",spongebob,1
That's my breakfast!,not spongebob,0
"Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?",spongebob,1
This song's got a great beat.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Knock, knock.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it.",spongebob,1
"So, do you come here often?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, SquarePants residence. What?  I'm sorry, what?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!",spongebob,1
You wanna talk to SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!",spongebob,1
"Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!",not spongebob,0
What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!,spongebob,1
"Sorry, he's not out there.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!,spongebob,1
"Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat!  Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.  Hey, check out his crazy comb.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet.  I hope they don't touch my special comb.",spongebob,1
"Well, I think I've aired it up enough.  Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.",not spongebob,0
"I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!",spongebob,1
"Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely.  Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings.",not spongebob,0
"I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but...  ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!",spongebob,1
"Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.,not spongebob,0
You criminals make me sick.,not spongebob,0
"I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!",spongebob,1
"Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!",not spongebob,0
"You have a nice party now, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.",spongebob,1
"Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?",not spongebob,0
"But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.",spongebob,1
"Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge.  Oh no, these cuffs are broken.",not spongebob,0
"Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.",not spongebob,0
Is it too late to offer you some punch?,spongebob,1
"Sir, you have the right to remain silent.",not spongebob,0
"All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster.",spongebob,1
That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!,not spongebob,0
It was?,spongebob,1
"Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!",not spongebob,0
I am?,spongebob,1
"Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!",not spongebob,0
"SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?",not spongebob,0
"Bawk! Okay, ready.",not spongebob,0

Bawk! It's time for your flute solo.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot...  Hey wait a minute. I don't play a flute. I play a fife.  Potty, no!  Wow, I can't believe I survived that one.  Potty, help me!",not spongebob,0
"Ladies and Gentlemen, bawk! The Bird Brains!",not spongebob,0
"♪Come with me to the land I love, It's not right here, down the street, or up above. It's down below in the deep blue sea. Where SpongeBob lives, and the fun is always free. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. Where our salty friend SpongeBob waits for you and me.  Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun. You and me forever in the underwater sun.

Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun You and me forever in the underwater sun, underwater sun.♪",not spongebob,0
"Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out.  And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time.",not spongebob,0
"Bawk, the ladies are here!",not spongebob,0

Thank you for coming to SpongeBob's House Party!,not spongebob,0
Belay the smooching. Belay the smooching!,not spongebob,0
"Greetings, children of Bikini Bottom. I am Karen the Computer Fairy.  And I have a magic tale to tell.  Once upon a time, there was a dim-witted sea star  who was about to stuff his fat face.",not spongebob,0
"Hee, hee, hee. That idiot has such a huge pile of patties. I don't think he'll notice if one walks away.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, I need more ketchup.",not spongebob,0
Hmm… which patty to choose? This one? Nope. Too small.  This one? Nope. Been chewed.  This one? Nope. The seeds are missing. Hmm...,not spongebob,0
"Ow! Stand up, you moron!",not spongebob,0
"Get me an ice pack, you idiot!",not spongebob,0
"Where are you, Voice?  Where are you?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. I thought you were this crazy voice who keeps telling me what to do.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's probably your conscience.",spongebob,1
What are conscience? Are they bad?,not spongebob,0
No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something  that's wrong.,spongebob,1
"So, I should do what the voice tells me to do?",not spongebob,0
Now that's a smart little sea star.,spongebob,1
"Patrick, this is your conscience speaking.",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Oh.  Nice to meet you, Conscience.",not spongebob,0
"So stupid. So, Stupid, the first thing you need to do is buy some more Krabby Patties on the double. Hi-yah! Hey-yo!",not spongebob,0
"That'll be the first thing I do, Conscience!",not spongebob,0
Yes!,not spongebob,0
Right after I run some errands.,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  No!  I'm calling the shots here. Now, get that Krabby Patty!",not spongebob,0
"I—I—It's just a little list! Please, Conscience?",not spongebob,0
"Alright, Pea-Brain. Make it quick.",not spongebob,0
Number 1: High-five everyone!  Huh!,not spongebob,0
"No, put me down first!",not spongebob,0
High-five!  High-five!  Low-five!  High-five!  High-five!  High-five!  High-five!  High-five!,not spongebob,0
"Number 2: Ice cream! Yeah!  One double chocolate molar blowout, please.",not spongebob,0
"One molar blowout, coming up!",not spongebob,0
No!  You hate ice cream. You only want Krabby Patties.  Hey you! Cancel that order!,not spongebob,0
Ow. You hate high-fives and ice cream? Are you sure you're my conscience?,not spongebob,0
"I, uh, I'm absolutely positively your conscience.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, doesn't your nose grow when you tell lies in fairy tales?",not spongebob,0
Nope. Noses only grow when you make up the truth.  See?,not spongebob,0
"Ah-ha-ha! Oh, oh, I wanna make up the truth, too! Uh, I ate a hot air balloon for breakfast.  I—I—I mean, um, I did not eat a hot air balloon for breakfast.  Hey! I got a big nose too! Nose fight! En garde!",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
Time to let your conscience be your guide. Give me that list!  Here!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, only one errand left!  Gotta give Plankton a Krabby Patty!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah! Yeah!",not spongebob,0
I wonder why I wanted to give Plankton a patty?,not spongebob,0
"Why not Plankton? He's a sweetheart.  And as your conscience, I demand you toss that patty in the mail slot!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I love mail slot toss!",not spongebob,0
Not so hard!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
I've been wanting to hit the beach all week.,not spongebob,0
Goo Lagoon! Goo Lagoon!,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Ah-ha! Patrick, please promptly pursue Plankton's patty!  Get the idea?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, uh.",not spongebob,0
How many plankton does it take to change a lightbulb?  One.,not spongebob,0
Huh? Now I get the idea! Whoo!  Gotta follow that patty!,not spongebob,0
"Wait for me, you pink pinhead!",not spongebob,0
"Ow! Hey, watch it!",not spongebob,0
There's Blubber Mouth.,not spongebob,0
There's Plankton's patty!,not spongebob,0
You know what to do.,not spongebob,0
Do I?  Oh yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well. No patty for Plankton.",not spongebob,0
Huh! I'm going in! Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
"Ugh. Just being near a whale's mouth gives me the creeps.  Quiet, you fool! You'll wake up Pearl.",not spongebob,0
This is snug.,not spongebob,0
Mother always said I'd end up in a whale's belly. Or prison.,not spongebob,0
Hey! Who-a goes-a there?,not spongebob,0
Who goes where?,not spongebob,0
The name's-a Geppetto. Take off your hats and stay a while.,not spongebob,0
"We don't have time for a visit, old man. We're just trying to find a sandwich.",not spongebob,0
"Sandwich? No, I haven't seen anything like that around-a here in months.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Geppetto, what's that behind your back?",not spongebob,0
Is that our Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
Nope.  Oh!,not spongebob,0
Ah-ha! I got the patty!,not spongebob,0
Ah-ha! I got the wig!,not spongebob,0
"Son, they're-a stealing our food!",not spongebob,0
"Who's stealing our food, Pop? Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!",not spongebob,0
"Get 'em, Pinocchio!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. A stomach ache at the beach? That's no fun! I wish it would go away.",not spongebob,0
Your wish is granted. Hold out your hand!,not spongebob,0
Wow! What is this?,not spongebob,0
"For fast relief of indigestion, try Gush and Flush. And wash your pain down the drain.  And my stupid husband, while you're at it.",not spongebob,0
Ah.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Extra Strength Gush and Flush!",not spongebob,0
"Pinocchio, we're-a free-a! Free-a!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Don't worry about the patty, Patrick. I'll take it to Plankton myself, like a good little conscience.  See ya!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, hey, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, my conscience?",not spongebob,0
Your wha?,not spongebob,0
"Yep, I'm Patrick's conscience. But I overslept.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you're my conscience conscience, then who's that?",not spongebob,0
It's a bug! Step on it!,not spongebob,0
"And they all lived happily ever after. So, until next time, this is—",not spongebob,0
Karen!,not spongebob,0
The Computer Fairy hoping all your dreams come true.,not spongebob,0
"Let me at 'em, Pop! Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! Let me—",not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeesh, we need some customers in here.  What's gotten into you?",not spongebob,0
I don't know.  What's happening to me?,not spongebob,0
"I think I can explain.  Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes.",spongebob,1
"Oh, he needs one, eh?  Methinks a paying customer's in our midst.  Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?",not spongebob,0
Give me!,not spongebob,0
"Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, I can pay for it.",not spongebob,0
Good boy.,not spongebob,0
Ten seconds later...,not spongebob,0
"My good man, how you doing?  Excellent. Now, let's get down to business.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
It's your bill.,not spongebob,0
I don't have any money.,not spongebob,0
What? I thought you said you could pay for it!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm payin' for it all right.",not spongebob,0
Non-paying customer!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"You're gonna pay, one way or another.  All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine.  I'll be back in a while to check up on you.  Bottom-feeding...",not spongebob,0
"No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la.  Work, work, work, work.",not spongebob,0
"So, Patrick, how are you...?  What in blazes did you do?",not spongebob,0
I accidentally tried the hand soap.  It doesn't taste as good as it smells.,not spongebob,0
See these ice cube trays?  I want you to put 'em in that bucket.,not spongebob,0
How do I do that?,not spongebob,0
Figure it out!,not spongebob,0
Uh... I have to be very gentle.,not spongebob,0
What the...? What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
"Almost done, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"You've destroyed me refrigerator.  You've destroyed many of the things I love.  I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up.  All you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so.  See?",not spongebob,0
Yup.,not spongebob,0
"Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again!",not spongebob,0
"Hurry, hurry, hurry!",not spongebob,0
"Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe.",not spongebob,0
"Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs.  Patrick, what's up, buddy?",spongebob,1
"I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down.",not spongebob,0
That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're a genius!  Oh, no, there's one left.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's not a...  trash bag.",spongebob,1
NO! Why won't you go down?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Can I eat now?,not spongebob,0
"What's the matter, buddy? You seem so sad.",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This.",not spongebob,0
My hat is sad?,spongebob,1
"No! You have a special hat, which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay...  bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place, too!",not spongebob,0
"First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?",spongebob,1
Uhhh...  Sand.,not spongebob,0
"Oof!  Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip,  but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it.",spongebob,1
"Think about it. Think, Patrick, think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh!  Thinking is painful.  Break time.",not spongebob,0
"Are you irritable? Listless? Jobless? Have you ever asked yourself: I'm a loser. What am I doing with my life? Well, look no further. I have an answer that has helped millions-",not spongebob,0
Be all you can possibly be.  Join the Marine Dolphins.,not spongebob,0
Muhahahahahahahaha!  Huh?  The inescapable display case!  Noooooooooo!,not spongebob,0
"All in a day's work, ehh, Mermaid Man?",not spongebob,0
Remember: It's up to you  to reveal the true face of crime. Sign up to be part of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Junior Crime Fighters.,not spongebob,0
"I gotta figure out what to do in my life.  Awww, I wish I was a superhero.  I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room!   Ahhhhh.  At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!",not spongebob,0
Where?,not spongebob,0
Where is everybody?,not spongebob,0
"Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.",not spongebob,0
Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down.,not spongebob,0
"It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area?  Hey, Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?",spongebob,1
Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!,not spongebob,0
"That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar-",spongebob,1
"Shush, SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help!  Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, howdya do on your final?",not spongebob,0
I aced it.,not spongebob,0
"Me, too.",not spongebob,0
Looks like all the studying paid off.,not spongebob,0
High five!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa, you okay. man?",not spongebob,0
Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!,not spongebob,0
Violence? But we were just giving high fiv--.,not spongebob,0
"No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere!",not spongebob,0
"Please, ma'am, allow me.",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Why, thank you, young man.",not spongebob,0
"Hehehehe, not a problem, ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo!  Sorry, lady, you're on your own.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear.   Oh, dear!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy.",not spongebob,0
Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!,not spongebob,0
But I found that dollar!,not spongebob,0
"Nah, enough! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs.  With Neptune's swiftness, away!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, a dollar!  This must be my lucky day.",not spongebob,0
"Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man!  I'll finish you off later, day-old donuts. Right now, I must move rapidly and act heroically!  What's this?  Don't move, and freeze!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!",not spongebob,0
"Boat thief? Heavens, no! My poor student is trapped inside this boat! The doors are jammed!",not spongebob,0
"Jammed doors, huh?  A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness,  away!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, merciful Neptune! The authorities are here. You'll be out of there in no time.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what do we have here?  Looks like Patrick-Man caught another one!  What would we do without superheroes?",not spongebob,0
"But, I didn't do anything!",not spongebob,0
"Grand Theft Vessel is a felony. You remember what a felony is, don't you, Mrs. Puff?",not spongebob,0
"Felony?! Yes, I...! Oh, ugh. Patrick-Man...",not spongebob,0
Help?,not spongebob,0
Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.,spongebob,1
Thank you. Let's hope Patrick-Man doesn't confiscate this one.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! He drank my shake, too! Said it was part of an evil plot.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far.",spongebob,1
"Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you.",not spongebob,0
What're you doing out there?,spongebob,1
Something a non-hero civilian would never understand.  I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes!,not spongebob,0
You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?,spongebob,1
"Overboaaard?! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's  Swiftness!  Villains and criminals, beware!  Patrick-Man is here!",not spongebob,0
Good gracious.,not spongebob,0
And he always finds out who hides under the mask!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, man, I'd like to hold onto my face, thank you!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, right.  Gotcha!",not spongebob,0
Yeouch! Let's get out of here and never come back.,not spongebob,0
"Whaaaaaaaat? Alright, that does it!",not spongebob,0
"Admit it, masked marauder!",not spongebob,0
Enough!  We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!,not spongebob,0
But I was about to unmask a supervillain!,not spongebob,0
Sure you were.  What the barnacles are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!,not spongebob,0
"Ohh, dear!",not spongebob,0
"Let her go, Patrick!",spongebob,1
No way!  Hey! Where'd he come from?,not spongebob,0
The Dirty Bubble?!,spongebob,1
The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.,not spongebob,0
"Fools, you blew my cover! Now taste my wrath!",not spongebob,0
"What now, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff!",not spongebob,0
I wouldn't call that a total miss.,not spongebob,0
"Take this, beast!",not spongebob,0
"Wha, no, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Haha, yummy sponge.",not spongebob,0
You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?,not spongebob,0
I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch!,not spongebob,0
"Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack!",not spongebob,0

"Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?",spongebob,1
"Why, of course, young man. That's, uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?",not spongebob,0
"What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?",spongebob,1
"Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.",not spongebob,0
Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time.,not spongebob,0
What's this?,not spongebob,0
Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!,not spongebob,0

Because I'm a nice guy!,not spongebob,0
Wow. There goes the nicest guy.,spongebob,1
Whoa.,not spongebob,0
Hooray! I win a free coupon!,not spongebob,0
H-how did you know about my free coupon?,not spongebob,0
Me back knows.  It breaks out in hives around anything free.,not spongebob,0
Guh.,not spongebob,0
I also know how heavy a free coupon can be.,not spongebob,0
It's heavy?,not spongebob,0
Much too much responsibility for a carefree fellow like you. Tell you what. I'll take that free coupon off your hands for the price of a hearty handshake.,not spongebob,0
Uh...Oh. Ohh! Oh! SpongeBob does love handshakes.,not spongebob,0
You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, come on. Can't an old crab have a little unscrupulous fun anymore?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you ruined my deal! I almost had a handshake!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you dingdong wing nut! Krabs was just trying to steal your coupon!",not spongebob,0
Steal my coupon? Hmm.  You want my ice cream coupon! You can't have it!,not spongebob,0
Okay. Whatever.,not spongebob,0
He never really knew how to sing.,not spongebob,0
No! Singers?,not spongebob,0
You.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I see you...peeking at my coupon! It's for SpongeBob's ice cream!",not spongebob,0
Hooray for SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's going on here?",not spongebob,0
Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!,not spongebob,0
Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon!,not spongebob,0
No! You can't have my coupon! No! No!,not spongebob,0
Officer Slugfish? We got a call about a sea star disturbance on your beat. Please investigate.,not spongebob,0
"Roger, headquarters. Hey, you.",not spongebob,0
Headquarters? I couldn't catch him. He got away.,not spongebob,0
You're a bad baby!,not spongebob,0
Whaa!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look, honey, it's Bikini Bottom's Sidewalk of the Stars.",not spongebob,0
"This one's gruesome. Hmm, looks like some kids' cartoon. Should we take a photo?",not spongebob,0
"Nah, waste of film.",not spongebob,0
Ooh.  Ah! Come back!  Ah!  I made it.  It's beautiful.,not spongebob,0
"And a good ice cream day to you, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, it's a good day for ice cream!",not spongebob,0
And what's your pleasure?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I want your bestest ice cream for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Excellent choice, sir. One Heavenly Paradise coming up.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob won't mind if I just take a little taste.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, this coupon's out of date. Expired two years ago. Sorry, we can't honor it.",not spongebob,0
No ice cream for SpongeBob? Huh?,not spongebob,0
I demand that you honor my coupon!,not spongebob,0
Temper tantrum in center aisle!,not spongebob,0
I'm on it.,not spongebob,0
"Take my coupon! Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Ah, take my—",not spongebob,0
"You poor, miserable creature.",not spongebob,0
I'm miserable.,not spongebob,0
"You wretched, worthless, shabby—",not spongebob,0
"Hey, don't you think you're being a little harsh?",not spongebob,0
Not really. Look at him.,not spongebob,0
Uh! Never mind. Continue and bump it up a little bit.,not spongebob,0
"Listen, buddy, there is one person who can honor this coupon; the person who owns this store. The Ice Cream King himself.",not spongebob,0
The Ice Cream King?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. He lives up there in that mansion.",not spongebob,0
Wow.,not spongebob,0
Do you need a push?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Would you, please?",not spongebob,0
Hello?,not spongebob,0
Are you the exterminator?,not spongebob,0
"Oh.  No. I'm not the extra gator. I'm here to redeem my coupon for a free ice cream! It's for my bestest friend, but it's out of date.",not spongebob,0
They're all out of date because I don't know what year it is.,not spongebob,0
I don't know what anything is.,not spongebob,0
Are you smart or dumb?,not spongebob,0
Apples?,not spongebob,0
Genius! Let's see your head.  I can't feel your brain.,not spongebob,0
It's down here today.,not spongebob,0
Mine too! High five!,not spongebob,0
Secret handshake?,not spongebob,0
"Perfect! You don't know the secret handshake either. Hey, I don't know your name.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you're right!",not spongebob,0
This may still be redeemable according to the fine print.,not spongebob,0
I didn't bring my reading eyes.,not spongebob,0
Try my glasses!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, ooh. It says garbaldy goop.",not spongebob,0
But spelled backwards is...  Poog Ydlabrag. The King's Challenge!,not spongebob,0
Hair growing contest!  Ah-ha!,not spongebob,0
Wow. Oh...,not spongebob,0
That's sad. Watch this.  Try beating that.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, man.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha! I beat you.",not spongebob,0
Not so fast!  Ha! Can I redeem my coupon now?,not spongebob,0
Not just yet. Best two out of three.,not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"Your butterscotch style is strong, Low Fat, but it is no match for my brownie bits!",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha! You'll wish your cone was a cup when I whip you into cream! Hi-ya!",not spongebob,0
"They told me you had scoops, but your serve is soft. I see you've studied the ancient art of failure!  Redeem my coupon!",not spongebob,0
Think fast—  rainbow sprinkles!,not spongebob,0
You have played with skill and courage. I will honor your coupon.,not spongebob,0
One free ice cream cone!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?",spongebob,1
"I was gonna give you this ice cream,  but it melted. Instead, I got you this hearty handshake.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!",spongebob,1
Care to join me?,spongebob,1
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
You're it!,not spongebob,0
"You're it!  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!",spongebob,1
Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?",spongebob,1
The rest of me is up here.,not spongebob,0
"Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head.",spongebob,1
I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.,not spongebob,0
"Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.",spongebob,1
Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.",spongebob,1
"Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.",not spongebob,0
"Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick!  Look, buddy, I captured one!",spongebob,1
Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner.,not spongebob,0
Okay...what do you wanna do?,spongebob,1
Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.,not spongebob,0
Pretty.,spongebob,1
"Yes, quite.",not spongebob,0
Fragile.,spongebob,1
Indeed.,not spongebob,0
"C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!",spongebob,1
"Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?",not spongebob,0
"I was thinking more like jumping rope,  1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab.",spongebob,1
Doesn't feel like fun.,not spongebob,0
"How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?",spongebob,1
You can't strum a jellyfish.,not spongebob,0
Yes!,spongebob,1
"Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going.",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon.  Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?",spongebob,1
Just studying this amazing subspecies.,not spongebob,0
I'll show you subspecies!,not spongebob,0
Wanna visit Squidward?,spongebob,1
"Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits.  I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, Symphony in Blue.",not spongebob,0
Patrick?,not spongebob,0
It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work.  May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.,not spongebob,0
Wow! I never thought to do it like that.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that is because you rarely think.",not spongebob,0
How do you know so much about music?,spongebob,1
A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance.  Ah.,not spongebob,0
Does that include...  belch-talk-ing?,spongebob,1
"Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.",not spongebob,0
"I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick! Do you think you can be my musical mentor?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, guys?",spongebob,1
"Let's take it from the top.  Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique.  On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin.  Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4...  Stop! Enough!  Find yourself a new mentor!",not spongebob,0
"Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap!",spongebob,1
"No, thanks again.",not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe later we can play pirates.",spongebob,1
"Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.",not spongebob,0
What? What do you mean?,spongebob,1
"I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.",not spongebob,0
"But Patrick, you're my best friend!",spongebob,1
"I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.",not spongebob,0
"Goodbye... Mr... Best friend!  Sandy, you there? I need some professional help.  Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.",not spongebob,0
"Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, really? Well, thanks.  Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?",not spongebob,0
You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.,not spongebob,0
"What do you mean by that, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.,not spongebob,0
Are you suggesting I'm dumb?,not spongebob,0
I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.,not spongebob,0
I think you'd better leave.,not spongebob,0
I was only trying to help.,not spongebob,0
"I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all! I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!",not spongebob,0
I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!,spongebob,1
Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with?  SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories.",spongebob,1
"Aww, the glory days. Why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem!  What could it be?  What's different? Ah!  What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!",not spongebob,0
"Coming...  Patrick, you're kidnapping me?",spongebob,1
"Yes, I am.",not spongebob,0
Yay!  What should we do?,spongebob,1
"We are going to have fun, whatever the cost may be.",not spongebob,0
Let's do this.,spongebob,1
"Yes, let's have some fun.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
"Oh, absolutely!  Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah!  That was fun, huh Patrick?",spongebob,1
"When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.,spongebob,1
That's it!,not spongebob,0
"That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick! Hold on, buddy!  There ya go.  Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again!  Not back there.  Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick!  Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?",spongebob,1
"Quite unchanged, actually.",not spongebob,0
I guess we'll never have fun together again.,spongebob,1
You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.,not spongebob,0
Yes.,spongebob,1
Where exactly did you find it?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, it was right here.",spongebob,1
"Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north.",not spongebob,0
"But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over...  Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy.  Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?",spongebob,1
Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!,not spongebob,0
"Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal.  Patrick? Say something, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you're back!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, you're back.",not spongebob,0
Giddy-up! Hyah!,not spongebob,0
"Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, those are hash browns.",spongebob,1
Hash browns!,not spongebob,0
"Um, Patrick, the slides.",spongebob,1
"Right. The slides.  Voila! Uh, now what?",not spongebob,0
Now you put the slides in the projector.,spongebob,1
"I knew that. Put the slides in the projec--  ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better.  Okay, here we go.  There I was...",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a shadow puppet show!",spongebob,1
"Please, no interruptions.",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,spongebob,1
"As I was saying...  I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door.  For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?",spongebob,1
"I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest! I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.  It's so exhausting.  Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.",not spongebob,0
"Pal, what you need is a vacation.",spongebob,1
That's it! I need a vacation!,not spongebob,0
"So, you'd like a vacation.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--",not spongebob,0
"Yes, he'd like a vacation.",spongebob,1
"Well, your options are endless, Mr. Star. Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris. It all depends on your budget.",not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
I guess I'll just have to stay home.,not spongebob,0
Stay home? That's it! You can take a stay-cation.,spongebob,1
Wh-what's that?,not spongebob,0
"Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
"All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation.",spongebob,1
"That's what I'm gonna do, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?",spongebob,1
I don't know. Can you?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star.  Patrick Star, room 801.  Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.  May I take your bags, Mr. Star?",spongebob,1
I don't have any ba--  Oh...,not spongebob,0
"Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way.  Your room, sir.",spongebob,1
"Oh, dear.",not spongebob,0
"Something wrong, Mr. Star?",spongebob,1
"Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged.",not spongebob,0
Arranged?,spongebob,1
One Hour Later.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Star, are you sure about this?",spongebob,1
"No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls.  I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!",not spongebob,0
The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.,spongebob,1
Ah a pool!  Where's the diving board?,not spongebob,0
"The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up.  Your diving board, sir.",spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"You okay, sir?",spongebob,1
"My head is swimming just fine, thank you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!  Lifeguard on duty!  You okay, sir?",spongebob,1
So cold.,not spongebob,0
This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.,spongebob,1
So weak.  Strength... returning.  But I'm still hungry.,not spongebob,0
"Follow me, sir.  If you would take your seat, sir.  Your dining bib, sir.",spongebob,1
Wow. What luxury.,not spongebob,0
One Krabby Patty coming up.,spongebob,1
"What, no tip?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir.  Presenting the SpongeBob Follies!  What the hey.",spongebob,1
Boring.  Lame.,not spongebob,0
"Three, two, one, liftoff.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what do you think?",spongebob,1
You are smokin'!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, it was nothing.",spongebob,1
"No, no, you're really smoking!",not spongebob,0
"What?  Oh, no, the Krabby Patty!",spongebob,1
My tummy is still lonely.  Ahh.,not spongebob,0
"Ah.  Ah, delish.  Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin.  And now an elegant meal for an elegant person.",not spongebob,0
I am quite refined.  Ah!,not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
"I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey, waiter...  a napkin, please.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Star, your meal is ready.  Patrick, where is he?  Ah!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!",not spongebob,0
Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa.  I could use a massage.,not spongebob,0
"Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that's the spot.  Hey, you should get a massage, too.",not spongebob,0
Not likely.  Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?!  Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet.,not spongebob,0
5 Hours Later.,not spongebob,0
"So tired.  Patrick, what are you doing here?",spongebob,1
"That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Wake up, laddy.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
You have another nasty old dream?,not spongebob,0
Mm-mmm.,spongebob,1
Patrick in your bed again?,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm.,spongebob,1
"Aye. Well, good night, laddy.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, sir.",spongebob,1
I don't get it! What's an audit?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing Certified Public Accountant isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!,spongebob,1
I am rolling the dice!   now I am moving!  Run... spreadsheets?,not spongebob,0
What does that even mean?!,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe I’m supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that sounds right to me!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Squidward. Wanna play Certified Public Accountant with us?",spongebob,1
"Oh, let me think. That sounds so,  no!",not spongebob,0
I don't think this game is ripe.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.",spongebob,1
What? Do you think that games grow on trees?,not spongebob,0
Doesn't everything grow on trees?,not spongebob,0
"No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.",not spongebob,0
Makes them?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.",not spongebob,0
Then I could make a game?,not spongebob,0
"No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.",spongebob,1
Your operative word there is “think.”,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! The opernive... word is think!  Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!",not spongebob,0
"Go get'em, Patrick!",spongebob,1
Double morons.,not spongebob,0
I invented a game! I invented a game!,not spongebob,0
Whoopee. Do tell.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you know how hard Tic-Tac-Toe is and how it always takes so long to play?",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!",not spongebob,0
"I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?",not spongebob,0
"It's called...  Tic-Tac! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh...",not spongebob,0
O?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, Tic-Tac!.  You start!",not spongebob,0
Tic-Tac.,not spongebob,0
Uh...  Best two out of four?,not spongebob,0
Many Tic-Tacs later...,not spongebob,0
Tic and Tac.,not spongebob,0
I should've gone with my first idea: Tic.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I got a new game! It's called Rock, Paper, Butter!",not spongebob,0
Butter invent a different game!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I got it!  Whose rope is longer? You...  Aww! You played this before!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.",not spongebob,0
"If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them.  Then you can use those elements in the game you invent.",not spongebob,0
I know what to do!,not spongebob,0
And so it begins.,not spongebob,0
It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!,not spongebob,0
I don't see the point of this game night. Every game that Patrick has invented is more pointless and boring than the last.,not spongebob,0
"This time, he did research.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!",not spongebob,0
This is gonna be written about in the history book someday.,spongebob,1
Yeah. In crayon.,not spongebob,0
Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.,not spongebob,0
More like a lamatourium. Ha.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome, gamers! And behold!  My game!",not spongebob,0
It's beautiful!,spongebob,1
Are we finished? Who won?,not spongebob,0
"No, my friend. We have only just begun.",not spongebob,0
"What's it called, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Might I suggest garbage?  What?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?",spongebob,1
It's called... Patrick! The Game!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma.,not spongebob,0
"Alright!  I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...",not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?",not spongebob,0
You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?,not spongebob,0
Both!,not spongebob,0
"Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.",not spongebob,0
I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm...  Okay!  Oh, money!",not spongebob,0
Yee-haw! Beachfront property!,not spongebob,0
Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?,spongebob,1
"Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?",spongebob,1
Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
You go to jail.,not spongebob,0
"What are you in for, pal?",not spongebob,0
My turn!  One... two...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.",not spongebob,0
Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!,not spongebob,0
Twelve. I'll... drive the car!,spongebob,1
"Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what do I do to get out of jail?",not spongebob,0
You have to roll a six.,not spongebob,0
Hey! you can't roll the dice when you're in jail!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, play by the rules.",spongebob,1
"Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six, and I can't roll if I'm in jail, just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, here it is!  The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.",not spongebob,0
Fine. Someone say my name.,not spongebob,0
"Oh boy! You landed on Do a Surgery!  Now, pick a surgery card.",not spongebob,0
Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.,not spongebob,0
What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!,not spongebob,0
"Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.",not spongebob,0
Got it.,not spongebob,0
"Now, sit back down, you criminal!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!",not spongebob,0
Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.,spongebob,1
"Well, neither have you.",not spongebob,0
That's it! I've had enough!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Squidward! Wait!",spongebob,1
"Don't go, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"No wait, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Wait, how'd he get out of jail?",not spongebob,0
Squidward made us say his name.,spongebob,1
"That was a smart move, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh. Hmm...,not spongebob,0
Now you roll after me.,spongebob,1
"Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...",spongebob,1
Race the car.,not spongebob,0
I'll...,spongebob,1
Race the car!,not spongebob,0
I'll... race the car!,spongebob,1
Oh boy! Snacks!,not spongebob,0
Jail for Squidward!,not spongebob,0
But I was on snacks!,not spongebob,0
Tell it to the judge!,not spongebob,0
Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!,not spongebob,0
Starving! Starving sea star time!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'm going outside.",not spongebob,0
"If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.",not spongebob,0
But I didn't say outsidies I said...,not spongebob,0
Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!,not spongebob,0
Ha.,not spongebob,0
Two.  Silly face! Silly face!,spongebob,1
"Now, that's a silly face!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means!  So, I could just roll the dice and say, Automatic Winner!",not spongebob,0
"Good job, Squidward! You've won!",spongebob,1
"Nice play, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.",not spongebob,0
Not so fast!  No player may declare himself Automatic Winner.,not spongebob,0
You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!,not spongebob,0
Destruction to private property.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, and I see here you are a repeat offender. You're going to real jail.",not spongebob,0
"Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!",not spongebob,0
Welcome back!,not spongebob,0
Somebody say my name!,not spongebob,0
Game over!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, one more book, then you go to sleep, 'kay?",spongebob,1
'Kay.,not spongebob,0
This one is called You Can Be Anything.,spongebob,1
I can be anything?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sure you can, pal.  You can be a firefighter...  You can be a doctor...  You can be a cowboy.",spongebob,1
That's what I want to be!,not spongebob,0
Cowboy. Great choice.,spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, no!  That.",not spongebob,0
"A horse?  Buddy, I don't think you want to be a horse.",spongebob,1
"You said I can be anything, and—and I want to be a horse!",not spongebob,0
"Sure, sure, you can be a horse.  Nighty-night, Patrick.",spongebob,1
A horse.  A horse.,not spongebob,0
"Not now, Gary. Give me a few more minutes.  What? Uh, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Oh, horsey!  Patrick, you were right! You can be a horse.",spongebob,1
"Easy there, big fella.  Easy...",spongebob,1
"Ah!  That's a good horsey. Hmm, horsey. That's not right. You need a name! I think I'll call you... Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Whoa!  Ride 'em, cowboy!",spongebob,1
"Uh, bucking bronco.",spongebob,1
Rodeo clown.,not spongebob,0
"Safety first.  Giddy up, Patrick!  Looking good, Ms. Sandy.",spongebob,1
Thank you. And the horse you rode in on?,not spongebob,0
"Morning, old timer.",spongebob,1
"Can we pet him, mister?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, but be gentle.",spongebob,1
He's so soft.,not spongebob,0
"What's all the hubbub out here?  What the?  So Patrick's a horse now? Ha-ha! Your phony baloney pony's more like an old gray mare.  Sorry to say, but, uh, this one's ready for the glue factory.",not spongebob,0
What kind of hub— What are you doing violating me personal space?,not spongebob,0
Aw... He's really fuzzy.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Horsey rides! Kids love horseys. Great idea having Patrick play pony. I'll charge these kids ten bucks a ride and cash in big time!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs, I think Patrick will only let me ride him.",spongebob,1
"Oh, nonsense. Pony rides! Ten buckaroos!",not spongebob,0
"Giddy up, Patrick.  Giddy up.",spongebob,1
"Now, I don't mean to nag, so don't bridle me when I say this, but your dream horse is more like a nightmare!  Get it? Night? Mare? Ha-ha!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, now you're feeling your oats.  Ha-ha! I'm so good.",not spongebob,0
Four at a time quadruplicates me money. Let's try for five.,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.  Ooh.  Oh!  Ooh.,not spongebob,0
My wittle weg!,not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
"All right, next up.",not spongebob,0
My other wittle weg!,not spongebob,0
"Horsey Patrick, come back!",spongebob,1
That's me money running away! Come back!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes, come back. I said, Whoa, horsey Patrick.  Look at me. I'm a horse.  Clopity, clopity, clopity.",not spongebob,0
"Clopity, clopity, clopity.",not spongebob,0
Patrick. Patrick...  Patrick.  Patrick!,spongebob,1
"Patrick?  Hey, it's okay, boy. It's me.  Your old pal, SpongeBob.  Remember?  Okay... Would you like me to whisper?  Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick. Good Patrick.  Calm down, buddy. I don't want to lose you again.  Whoa! Ow! Ow!",spongebob,1
"Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me.  Patrick horsey, giddy up!",spongebob,1
What?,spongebob,1
"Oh, this is humiliating.",not spongebob,0
"Quiet.  Horseys don't talk. Okay, kids, ten bucks a ride! Who's next?",not spongebob,0
"Me!  Get moving, horse!",not spongebob,0
Ow! Cut it out!,not spongebob,0
Ride's over.  Who's next?,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Mr. Krabs. How'd you get Squidward to give rides?",spongebob,1
Hmm...  Says right here in his contract.  I can work him like a horse.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, get your mule away from my show pony! This here's a Thoroughbred.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Look at that flank.  Get a load of those locks. Not to mention that loin, eh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. I'm a real stud.",not spongebob,0
Now look at your old pile of dog food.,not spongebob,0
I'd put my pile of dog food up against your stud any day!,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah? How 'bout a race, then?  First one to delivery a Krabby Patty to Black Devil Bay wins.",not spongebob,0
You're on!,spongebob,1
I want a clean race. No cheating! Wait for the bell.  Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha! Eat my dust!",not spongebob,0
"Well, okay.  Mmm.  Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!",spongebob,1
"This shortcut sign should send SpongeBob and Patrick far from the finish line.  Hi-ho, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa! Whoa, shortcut. This could be a trick. I love tricks!",spongebob,1
"Whoa, whoa!  Hyah! Oh, boy, we're ahead!",spongebob,1
"No, you're actually behind!",not spongebob,0
"Oh...  Huh? Whoa, Patrick. Whoa.",spongebob,1
"Oh!  Have some slippery mustard, slowpokes!  That was extra spicy slippery mustard!  Oh, ratfish!  I've got one more trick up me sleeve.  This is the police! I'm pulling you over for speeding!",not spongebob,0
"No, this is the police! I'm pulling you over for impersonating an officer!",not spongebob,0
"Here's your delivery, sir.",spongebob,1
What?,spongebob,1
I was hungry.,not spongebob,0
We win! We win!  I—I had the best horsey! I had the best horsey!,not spongebob,0
I don't want to be a horse anymore.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, buddy, but remember, you can still be anything.",spongebob,1
"In that case, I think I'll be...  a crab! Ark, ark, ark, ark, ark, ark!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Oh, no, you don't! Come back here with me claws!",not spongebob,0
"How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy?",spongebob,1
"Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.",spongebob,1
"Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.",not spongebob,0
Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?,spongebob,1
"Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
Please reply.,spongebob,1
I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.,not spongebob,0
"Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.",not spongebob,0
"I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud...  ... noises.",spongebob,1
Oops.,not spongebob,0
"Is he still after us, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"I don't know, buddy!",not spongebob,0
Should we turn around and check?,spongebob,1
Ok.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.",spongebob,1
I think I landed on a rock.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.",spongebob,1
That's just Squidward sunbathing again.,not spongebob,0
"No, not that, Patrick. This!",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.,spongebob,1
We?,not spongebob,0
"Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I'll say.,not spongebob,0
"Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO!  Go on, you first.  Kinda dark, huh?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, dark.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir.  Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!",spongebob,1
"Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.",not spongebob,0
Gimme that wheel!,spongebob,1
No! Let go! I wanna drive!,not spongebob,0
"I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.",not spongebob,0
Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?",not spongebob,0
"Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?",not spongebob,0
La la la la la la la la la la la la.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, of course! But how?",not spongebob,0
"Can we park here?  Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.",spongebob,1
Or even around the block!,not spongebob,0
"That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road.  So long, boys. Make me lots of money!",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Bye, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"You said Bye, Squidward twice.",not spongebob,0
I like Squidward.,spongebob,1
"A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn.",not spongebob,0
Hello!,spongebob,1
Hello.,not spongebob,0
Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?,spongebob,1
No thanks.,not spongebob,0
Now what?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back.  Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",not spongebob,0
Wait! We'll pay ya!,spongebob,1
"Hey, thanks again, guys. Good luck with the restaurant!",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, sir, come again!",spongebob,1
Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected.,not spongebob,0
Customer approaching.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, does it come in raspberry?",not spongebob,0
"Um, no.",not spongebob,0
Blueberry?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...raspberry?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?",not spongebob,0
"I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way. What do you think this is?",not spongebob,0
"I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that. Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital.",not spongebob,0
"Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!",not spongebob,0
You're probably right.,not spongebob,0
You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here.  What the?  No! Controls malfunctioning!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty?  Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?",spongebob,1
"Hey, the rocks are all gone.",not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"Folks, have I got a deal for you.",spongebob,1
"Alright, get 'im!",not spongebob,0
"Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"No, but I see a sign. It says. Warning: Ab...eyes?",not spongebob,0
"Here, let me see.  No, Patrick, that says Abyss.",spongebob,1
"Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"An abyss is a bottomless...  ...chasm!  Pat, we're falling!",spongebob,1
And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!,not spongebob,0
Yes! Yes!,not spongebob,0
And now a deafening warning siren!,not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss!",spongebob,1
Hey!  Who are you calling dark and depressing?,not spongebob,0
"Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?",spongebob,1
"Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my last meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.",not spongebob,0
Then try one of our Krabby Patties.,spongebob,1
Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill...back in '76. I'll take 640 of them.,not spongebob,0
Woo hoo!,not spongebob,0
Order...uh...up!,not spongebob,0
"Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me.  This calls for drastic-er-est measures!  Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
Neither do I!,not spongebob,0
"Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the...  Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.",not spongebob,0
Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, look!",not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
It's a liquid.,not spongebob,0
"No, it's a solid! It's a solid!",spongebob,1
It's a lol-squid.,not spongebob,0
"All right, what's going on in there?  Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!",not spongebob,0
But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.,spongebob,1
Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!,not spongebob,0
Anything else before we shove off?,spongebob,1
I want dessert!,not spongebob,0
We- We don't have desserts.,spongebob,1
"Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, a chocolate éclair!  Now that looks like dessert to me!",not spongebob,0
"No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey!",not spongebob,0
"There you are, Mr. Krabs, just like new again.",not spongebob,0
Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the...,not spongebob,0
"We're back, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!",not spongebob,0
"You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!",spongebob,1
I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.,not spongebob,0
"There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.",spongebob,1
And paper.,not spongebob,0
You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?,not spongebob,0
"But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!",spongebob,1
"You wanted to see me, sir?",spongebob,1
"Pull up a seat, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.",spongebob,1
"Sit down!  Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.",spongebob,1
"That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of the secret ingredient  to the secret formuler!",not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
"Listen up, boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and I'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this without any foul-ups! Understand?",not spongebob,0
Could you repeat that?,spongebob,1
It's time!  Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!,not spongebob,0
I won't let you down.,spongebob,1
Wait!,not spongebob,0
Yes?,spongebob,1
If something happens to that secret ingredient... don't bother coming back to work!,not spongebob,0
You BobPants?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
"Close enough.  Now get out of here, kid! Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!  And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patty, secret ingredienty.  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?! No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe?  What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  What are you doing lollygagging about?! Get back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Right away, sir.",spongebob,1
Hop to it! There's lots of hungry customers out there!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.",spongebob,1
With what?,not spongebob,0
With this.,spongebob,1
"Here you go, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Not that kind of help! This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!",spongebob,1
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!",spongebob,1
Find out!,not spongebob,0
You and I are gonna have to do a little detective work!,spongebob,1
"What are we eating this time, Karen?",not spongebob,0
Something new.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you mean the secret recipe I came up with?",not spongebob,0
Aha! I knew it was you!,spongebob,1
What was me?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!",spongebob,1
Is this a joke?,not spongebob,0
Why don't you tell me. Is it?!,spongebob,1
"Uh, no.",not spongebob,0
Good one!,not spongebob,0
"All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk!",spongebob,1
"Sorry, I really have nothing for you.",not spongebob,0
Then how do you explain this?,spongebob,1
"Okay, you caught me.",not spongebob,0
And so the truth floweth forth.,spongebob,1
"Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm.,spongebob,1
"But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty.  After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter in the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.",not spongebob,0
Yuck!,spongebob,1
"Try it, tell me what you think.",not spongebob,0
"Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?",spongebob,1
Good question.,not spongebob,0
"Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist.  There she is.  You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look.  Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy!  Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there, buddy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, long enough, buddy.",spongebob,1
I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?,not spongebob,0
"I'm onto you, squirrel.  You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.",spongebob,1
"What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"What I am getting at, is that you...  ...cloaked yourself an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter...",spongebob,1
What was that?,not spongebob,0
Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient.,not spongebob,0
"...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties, so you wouldn't have to pay.",spongebob,1
"Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them,  and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!",not spongebob,0
"283 Krabby Patties.  That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!",not spongebob,0
"My own house, huh?  Why'd you do it, Gary?!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!  First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tear ducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"What's that, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this... this marauder to the sketch artist?",spongebob,1
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.,not spongebob,0
I can't believe it! It was Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few...  He's not cooperating.",spongebob,1
You know what to do.,not spongebob,0
"And one, and...",not spongebob,0
Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.,spongebob,1
But we hear-ed what you've done.,not spongebob,0
"If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!  And we have an eyewitness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.",spongebob,1
A case like this?,not spongebob,0
Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without...  tap dancing shoes?,spongebob,1
That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.,not spongebob,0
I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient.,spongebob,1
Get out of my house!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs! I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!",not spongebob,0
"I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.",spongebob,1
"Well, do you have any leads, or clues?",not spongebob,0
"All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.",spongebob,1
"That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!",not spongebob,0
Me?!,spongebob,1
"That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper.  You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket,  where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck.  Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now!",not spongebob,0
No need. We heard it all from this barrel.,not spongebob,0
"Then arrest this thief, Officer!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?",spongebob,1
"Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient.",not spongebob,0
Am I to understand that you stole the item in question?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...",not spongebob,0
And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?,not spongebob,0
I can explain!,not spongebob,0
Please do.,not spongebob,0
"It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.",not spongebob,0
I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story.,not spongebob,0
What?! What'd I do?,not spongebob,0
All rise. Eugene Krabs.,not spongebob,0
Your Honor?,not spongebob,0
"As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"Give away me patties for free?!  Oh, no! I couldn't bear the sight of that!",not spongebob,0
"Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties!",spongebob,1
Ah-ah-achoo!  36 days without a customer.,not spongebob,0
So... hungry...,not spongebob,0
"Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!",spongebob,1
Ah!,not spongebob,0
No food... 3 days...,not spongebob,0
"Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way!  Uhh... You got money, right?",not spongebob,0
Yeah...,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, sir.",spongebob,1
"Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?",not spongebob,0
Finest under the sea!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
I mean look at this place.  I mean... what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring.  Foooood... water... atmosphere...,not spongebob,0
Nobody goes to a restaurant for atmosphere.  They go for food!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Tom!",not spongebob,0
"Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?",not spongebob,0
Nah. Let's go to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!,not spongebob,0
"Great! Say, what's a dog?",not spongebob,0

Uhh... I gotta draw a new battery for this!,not spongebob,0
What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.",not spongebob,0
I'm scared.,spongebob,1
Then I'm going in for you!,not spongebob,0
Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants!,not spongebob,0

How can you make money with such a stupid idea?,not spongebob,0
And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?,not spongebob,0
"At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...  ...shredding it...  ...and burning it!  But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.",spongebob,1
"Come again, sir!",not spongebob,0
I'm getting back in line!,not spongebob,0
I don't believe it!  I've got to see this for me self!,not spongebob,0

"They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.,not spongebob,0

A flip book?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I don't even know what that is!",not spongebob,0
"No, wait. Noooooooo!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?",spongebob,1
"Of course you can, lad!  You just gotta give me one penny.",not spongebob,0
"But, but...",spongebob,1
But what?,not spongebob,0
"But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie.  Oh, well.",spongebob,1
"Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.",not spongebob,0

My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag!,spongebob,1
"Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1

Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny.",spongebob,1
It wasn't?,not spongebob,0
"No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.",spongebob,1
"Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah, well, good night, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.",not spongebob,0
"Backing up!  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop...",spongebob,1
You're better off not knowing.,not spongebob,0
"...boop, boop, boop!  Your Krabby Patty, sir.",spongebob,1

"Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho!  The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!",not spongebob,0
Not the mollusks!,spongebob,1
Mollusks? What mollusks?,not spongebob,0
"There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks!",not spongebob,0
The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!,not spongebob,0
It's too bad nobody listened to him.,not spongebob,0
What beeth the deal with ye olde nutcase?,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative.",spongebob,1
"Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.",not spongebob,0
"That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate.  Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?",not spongebob,0
"Gee, thanks, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"A-a-ah, watch.  See?",not spongebob,0
Doesn't that hurt?,spongebob,1
Every time!,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.",spongebob,1
"Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell.",not spongebob,0
"I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor.  I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out.",spongebob,1
HI-YAH!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.",not spongebob,0
"Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas.",not spongebob,0
She's ready to blow!,not spongebob,0
Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.,spongebob,1
"Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there was my uncle Sherm.  He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose.",spongebob,1
That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Let's do a little digging around your family tree.,not spongebob,0
"Family Histories of Bikini Bottom. Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here!",not spongebob,0
Gasp!,spongebob,1
It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!,not spongebob,0
I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?,spongebob,1
"Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days.  It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.",not spongebob,0
"Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye!",not spongebob,0

"What can I get you, stranger?",not spongebob,0
Give me a shot of milk.,not spongebob,0
Milk?,not spongebob,0
Two percent.,not spongebob,0
Think you can handle it?,not spongebob,0
"I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey.  Aah,  Oh, yeah! Smooth.",not spongebob,0
Right.,not spongebob,0
"What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?",not spongebob,0
Strange is right.,not spongebob,0
The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job.,not spongebob,0
Wonderful! You're hired.  Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff!,not spongebob,0
"Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job.  Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm.",not spongebob,0
"No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.",not spongebob,0
In a good way?,not spongebob,0
"No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!",not spongebob,0
Since when?,not spongebob,0
"Shshshshshsh! So that means, you're the new sheriff!",not spongebob,0
What happened to the old sheriff?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, he's at Boot Hill.",not spongebob,0
"Gasp! And, why is he at boot hill?",not spongebob,0
Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full.,not spongebob,0
He's a' coming! Dead Eye's a' coming!,not spongebob,0
Dead Eye?!,not spongebob,0
Dead Eye?!,not spongebob,0
Who's Dead Eye?,not spongebob,0
"I'll tell you who Dead Eye is! But I shall do it through song. Maestro, if you please.  ♪Oh, Bikini Gulch was a purdy place with sweet water and blue sky. 'Til one day a beast 'come a-riding from the east by the name of Ol' Dead Eye.♪",not spongebob,0

We just sang a whole song about him!,not spongebob,0
"Well, what are you looking at?!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, again?",not spongebob,0
"Get up you two! I'm here for my... money, Krabs  .",not spongebob,0
"What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke, here!",not spongebob,0
That's the idea!  I thought we were all clear on that.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!,not spongebob,0
Hey! That's not your money.,not spongebob,0
"WHO SAID THAT?  Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg!  then  Yokelburg...  Who are you anyway?",not spongebob,0
"I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?",not spongebob,0
Sheriff!  'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!,not spongebob,0
Coffin jockeys!?  You didn't say anything about that!,not spongebob,0
That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.,not spongebob,0
"Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl!",not spongebob,0
"Where do you get these guys?  All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?",not spongebob,0
Uh huh.,not spongebob,0
And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?,not spongebob,0
Yep.,not spongebob,0
"So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?",not spongebob,0
Sounds great!,not spongebob,0
You have no idea what I'm talking about?,not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"(sighs)  And stay out! Hey, only three seconds off my record!  What are you hayseeds looking at?  Get out of here!",not spongebob,0
"What's gonna happen to the town now, Pa?",not spongebob,0
I ain't your pa.,not spongebob,0
I love this town!,not spongebob,0

It does?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!",not spongebob,0
"I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing.",not spongebob,0
"Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me!  Duhhh...",not spongebob,0
"I don't know,  Ow! Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!",not spongebob,0
"Hop on, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.",not spongebob,0
Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya!,not spongebob,0
Why are we going so fast?,not spongebob,0
"'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs!",not spongebob,0
"Great idea!  Okay, let's see,  personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!",not spongebob,0
"I gotta admit, he's got skills.",not spongebob,0
"That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives!  Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how!",not spongebob,0
"So, that's it.",not spongebob,0
We lost.,not spongebob,0
I don't know how it could get any worse.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!",not spongebob,0
We're heroes!,not spongebob,0
You're morons!,not spongebob,0
It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!,not spongebob,0
But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.",not spongebob,0
And all our stuff.,not spongebob,0
"And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!",not spongebob,0
"You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.",not spongebob,0
Could you get to the point? We're freezing!,not spongebob,0
"What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I think we all know the answer.",not spongebob,0
"Forget it, SpongeBuck!",not spongebob,0
"Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight!",not spongebob,0
That pillow sure packs a wallop!,not spongebob,0
"It's made out of wood,  like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?",not spongebob,0

"No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far.  But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I am terrified.",not spongebob,0
Dead Eye Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
"So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.",not spongebob,0
"You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right-- Hey!",not spongebob,0

I liked my design better.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! Fry cook!  Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'",not spongebob,0
Aaw!,not spongebob,0
Say seaweed!,not spongebob,0
So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa.  It was much better than that one we have now.,spongebob,1

Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball.,not spongebob,0
"Well, who knows how long it... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!",spongebob,1
"There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look, Patrick!",spongebob,1
Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.,not spongebob,0

"I'm right here, Bubble Bass.",spongebob,1
I thought I ran you out of town.,not spongebob,0
This is where I belong!  .,spongebob,1

Rawr.,spongebob,1
"Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.",not spongebob,0
I didn't.,spongebob,1
"Hmm... ...Still no pickles!  See?  You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants!",not spongebob,0
Wait a minute!  Look!  He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!,spongebob,1
"And there's the pickles from last time, too!",not spongebob,0
And there's my car keys!,not spongebob,0
And... there's my ride!,not spongebob,0
"Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Hooray.,not spongebob,0
Hip hip...,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Whoop-de-doo.,not spongebob,0
Hip hip...,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward!  Hip hip...,spongebob,1
Boo!,not spongebob,0
Hip hip...,spongebob,1
Boo!,not spongebob,0
Hip hip...,spongebob,1
Boo!,not spongebob,0
Hip hip...,spongebob,1
Boo! You stink!,not spongebob,0
"Nice try, alarmy, but you've got to get up pretty early to wake me up on picture day!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque.  Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Fine, fine, not to worry, no problem.  I'm ready, again!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"It's time to take a corrective approach.  Good morning Squidward! I'd love to stop and chat right now, but it's Picture Day. Whoa!",spongebob,1
"Still looking good, Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner.",spongebob,1
"Take cover! The teenagers, they've been let out of school and they're pelting us with balloons filled with...",not spongebob,0
Ketchup?,spongebob,1
"Save yourself, kid!  I'm finished!",not spongebob,0
Gotcha!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today.",spongebob,1
"Oh, pictures, huh? Well, let me help you with your makeup, HAH!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I...",spongebob,1
"Fiddlesticks, missed again.",not spongebob,0
"And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new...  No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen of...  Sponge Gloss.  There it is. So close, and still so shiny.  Hey, it's just water.  Aww! Stamps?!  Oatmeal!  Glue.",spongebob,1
"Hey, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, a little privacy here.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.",not spongebob,0
"Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world.",spongebob,1
I have a solution.,not spongebob,0
Ew!,spongebob,1
Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.,not spongebob,0
"That's it!  This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time.",spongebob,1
"We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick...",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly!",spongebob,1
"Huh?! SpongeBob, get out of my taco!  What's the matter, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells!",spongebob,1
"Oh, there you are!",not spongebob,0
Say cheese.,not spongebob,0
"And here's the last one. Now, just give a nice smile to the camera, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, can I go home and change first?",spongebob,1
No time. Say cheese.,not spongebob,0
"Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!",spongebob,1
Quit that moody brooding. This will clean you up.  Don't snivel like that. A winner doesn't snivel. Try putting this on.  This is it. Now you are looking like a winner.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture.",not spongebob,0
"Do not worry, Mrs. Puff. I brought Pearlie.",not spongebob,0
I can't stop crying!,spongebob,1
"This will make you smile, yeah, whether you want to or not.  Say cheese.",not spongebob,0
"Cheese.  There I am.  Hey, I don't look so bad after all!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
All ready to go jellyfishing today?,spongebob,1
No. Just kidding!,not spongebob,0
I see you even brought your double net.,spongebob,1
Yep. It's three times as fun.,not spongebob,0
"Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?",spongebob,1
What is?,not spongebob,0
Your— never mind.,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.",not spongebob,0
Good idea.,spongebob,1
And now the weather.,not spongebob,0
Here we go.,spongebob,1
"Thank you, Phil. Today's weather forecast calls for—  A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area.",not spongebob,0
A horrible storm?,not spongebob,0
"You heard me. Panic is not advised although it is recommended. Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.",not spongebob,0
"Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.",spongebob,1
Hmm.,not spongebob,0
"Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.",spongebob,1
You can say that again.,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I can't.",spongebob,1
Why?,not spongebob,0
Because I just stepped on one of these nails.,spongebob,1
"La da dee, la da da, la da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—",not spongebob,0
Grr!,not spongebob,0
Violin.,not spongebob,0
"Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.",spongebob,1
I guess Squidward's not part of nature.,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?,spongebob,1
No! I— what storm?,not spongebob,0
The one Preflumster told us about.,spongebob,1
Who's that?,not spongebob,0
He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said—,not spongebob,0
I can't understand a word you're saying.,not spongebob,0
"C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...",spongebob,1
I thought it was cocoa!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.",spongebob,1
That's better.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I think I'll pass.",not spongebob,0
Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?,spongebob,1
"Hmm, I'll have to think about that.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—",spongebob,1
"Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.",spongebob,1
That's better.,spongebob,1
"What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, the lights went out.",spongebob,1
"Yes, they did, when you turned them off!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Patrick! What is it?,spongebob,1
I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.",spongebob,1
This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.,not spongebob,0
"He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
One.,not spongebob,0
Two.,spongebob,1
Three!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's a tie.",spongebob,1
Darn it!,not spongebob,0
"One, two, three.",not spongebob,0
Darn it! I'll get you next time.,not spongebob,0
"One, two, three.",not spongebob,0
Tie.,spongebob,1
Darn it!,not spongebob,0
"One, two, three.",not spongebob,0
Tie.,spongebob,1
Darn it!,not spongebob,0
"There, I win. See?",not spongebob,0
I'm not seeing anything there.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.",spongebob,1
"What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!",not spongebob,0
"Easy, friend.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.",spongebob,1
"Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Well played.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. You can do it.",spongebob,1
Be the puzzle piece.,spongebob,1
Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.",spongebob,1
Eh?,not spongebob,0
"Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!",spongebob,1
Grrr!,not spongebob,0
"Go, Patrick, go!",spongebob,1
I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—,not spongebob,0
"Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!",spongebob,1
Who's the green guy?,not spongebob,0
It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!,not spongebob,0
Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.,spongebob,1
Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.",spongebob,1
I've got to get out of here!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—",spongebob,1
"No, I can't.",not spongebob,0
"Please, Squidward?",spongebob,1
No way.,not spongebob,0
Please...,spongebob,1
I have an even better idea.,not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
Tell us.,not spongebob,0
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!,not spongebob,0
Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called boundaries.,not spongebob,0
Ooh-ooh-ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
Will there be any spelling in this game?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, no spelling.",not spongebob,0
Yes!,not spongebob,0
"It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.",not spongebob,0
I have a question.,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Where are you going to get the chalk?,spongebob,1
I brought some!,not spongebob,0
"Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food.",not spongebob,0
Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.,spongebob,1
I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.,not spongebob,0
"If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.",spongebob,1
"Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—",not spongebob,0
Hmm. You may be telling the truth.,spongebob,1
"Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.",not spongebob,0
"But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.",spongebob,1
That'll be the day.,not spongebob,0
Stop that cephalopod!,spongebob,1
Please. I just want to get back... onto my side of boundary.,not spongebob,0
"This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules.",spongebob,1
But all I wanted was something to eat.,not spongebob,0
Did somebody say something to eat?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, look out!",spongebob,1
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
My food!,not spongebob,0
Your food?,spongebob,1
"Hey, I want some too.",not spongebob,0
Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?,not spongebob,0
"Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.",spongebob,1
Did you hear that?,not spongebob,0
It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.,spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.",not spongebob,0
I don't hear anything.,spongebob,1
The storm must've stopped.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!",spongebob,1
"Woo-hoo! So long, suckers!",not spongebob,0
"Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?",not spongebob,0
Good question.,not spongebob,0
Say what?,not spongebob,0
I said good luck!,not spongebob,0
That formula will be mine!,not spongebob,0
"Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it!  Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!",not spongebob,0
"That's right, everyone. Gather in real close.  Time to trigger the stench!  Yoink!",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  No, no, no, no, no, no!",spongebob,1
Not the patties! I'll save you!,spongebob,1
What's all the racket out here?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?",spongebob,1
I don't know. Me eyes were burning! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  Plankton!  He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it!  He could be reading it!,not spongebob,0
"Give me your hand, boy-oh!  I need to borrow this.  Ok, I'm going in!",not spongebob,0
"Good luck, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Why you little...,not spongebob,0
"I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo!",not spongebob,0
What? The old safe in the safe routine?,not spongebob,0
Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!,not spongebob,0
I'm not hungry!,not spongebob,0
Eww.  SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir. I see the problem.",spongebob,1
Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.,not spongebob,0
Looks like I'm going to have to beef up security around here.,not spongebob,0
"I'm going to need you to do me a big favor, laddie.",not spongebob,0
Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?",spongebob,1
Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.,not spongebob,0
He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, there.",not spongebob,0
"Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie.",spongebob,1
"Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula.  Hair! Hair! I got to go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton.",spongebob,1
Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, bye!",spongebob,1
The next morning...,not spongebob,0
"Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Bye, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob...  I mean your master at home?  Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.",not spongebob,0
"Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...",not spongebob,0
Meow!,not spongebob,0
My leg!,not spongebob,0
"Your friends won't tell you this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, smelly!",not spongebob,0
Moments later...,not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, sir...  Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.",not spongebob,0
"How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them.  If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.",not spongebob,0
"Meow, meow!",not spongebob,0
Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract.,not spongebob,0
More moments later...,not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
I forgot how much I hate pineapple.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple.  Now, where is that secret formula?",not spongebob,0
Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.,not spongebob,0
"Nothing in there.  Ooh, look at that.",not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
Where the barnacles is it?,not spongebob,0
Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not fooling anybody! I went to college!,not spongebob,0
"Nope, nope, nope.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!",not spongebob,0
Meow!,not spongebob,0
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!,not spongebob,0
Of course! What a fool I've been!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh?  Aye yae yae!,not spongebob,0
"Gary, I'm home!",spongebob,1
"What happened here?  My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren!  My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times!  My glass of water!  I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!",spongebob,1
Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.,spongebob,1
"Gary, did you do this?",spongebob,1
"What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow!",not spongebob,0
"Something's not right, Gary.",spongebob,1
I'd better get you to the vet.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell.  What's that?  This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!",not spongebob,0
The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's odd. Who's that?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's Plankton.",spongebob,1
What's he got there?,not spongebob,0
Looks like one of my old grocery lists.,spongebob,1
"I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!",not spongebob,0
"I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!",not spongebob,0
One glorious week  without those two...,not spongebob,0
Hey!,spongebob,1
...Idiots!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Hold on, Squidward!  You should be more careful.",spongebob,1
"Tisk, tisk... tisk!",not spongebob,0
Would you two go away and stop ruining my vacation?!,not spongebob,0
"Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations.",spongebob,1
I found someone to cover for me.,not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty coming up, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"If you must know, I'm going to Porpoise Peak to bask in the melodious sounds of the Warbling Water Lily.  Which only blooms once every five hundred years.  And I'm going alone. }}",not spongebob,0
"I know!  Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together.",spongebob,1
"Oh no, you're not messing up my vacation.  Now beat it! If I don't get moving, I'm gonna miss it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, we'll help you pack.",spongebob,1
"No way, you idiots will just break...  ...everything?  Oh.",not spongebob,0
Hold it!  We forgot to pack this.,not spongebob,0
"What? No, don't! Stop!",not spongebob,0
Phew.,not spongebob,0
You could buff that out.,not spongebob,0
How could?!...  Why would?!...  I can't believe it!  I'll never see the warbling water-lily bloom now.,not spongebob,0
They ruined Squidward's hopes of seeing the warbling water lily. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to feel bad for Squidward as he walks to his house.],not spongebob,0
Oh. Poor Squidward.,not spongebob,0
Oh! I have an idea.,spongebob,1
Really? What's that like?,not spongebob,0
"Little monsters. They oughta be locked up. Throw away the key and then...  Locked up and throw them away.  Oh, oh, phew. It was only a nightmare.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Would you get out of my bedroom?!,not spongebob,0
"We're not in your bedroom, silly.",spongebob,1
What? How did I get here?,not spongebob,0
Patrick and I mo-,spongebob,1
"Actually, I don't care.  Goodbye, SpongeB-    SpongeBob, why is your house...  driving on the road?!",not spongebob,0
Because we turned it into an RV!,not spongebob,0
We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming.,spongebob,1
Okay. Hold on. Who's driving?,not spongebob,0
It's on Autosnail.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, let's get breakfast.",spongebob,1
"Hey, this looks pretty good.",not spongebob,0
Are you gonna eat that?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break.",spongebob,1
Disengaging Autosnail!,not spongebob,0
"Meow, meow, meow, meow.",not spongebob,0
Let's see what this pineapple can do!  On the road!,not spongebob,0
We gotta get off this road!,not spongebob,0
No problem.,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
I'm not here! This isn't happening!,not spongebob,0
We're here!,spongebob,1
"Huh?  The warbling water lily!  Oh, so beautiful! And I have it all to my...  Ow! My back!  Huh? Where is it?",not spongebob,0
Is this that babbling buttercup you were looking for?,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's one more vacation down the drain. May as well go home.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we got a long drive ahead of us.  We better go before go if you know what I mean-o.",spongebob,1
Not really.,not spongebob,0
"Now, Squidward, don't leave without us.",spongebob,1
"Huh? Of course not! Only a monster would leave you behind.  So I'm a monster.  They'll be fine. Alone.  On top of a mountain. In the middle of nowhere.  D'oh, I can't do it!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"And next week, I'm starting on two-ply.",not spongebob,0
"I'll get another roll from the RV.  Hey, where is the RV?",spongebob,1
"Well, maybe those guys have seen it. Hey, hey! Have you seen our pineapple?",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, I'm too late!  Don't you dare eat those morons!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, they weren't eating us.",spongebob,1
We were just having a tickle fight.,not spongebob,0
Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies.,spongebob,1
But they hate it when you karate chop their hineys.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, tickle, tickle?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead!",spongebob,1
This will help! Catch!,not spongebob,0
Bye. Call me. You got my number.  Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip?,spongebob,1
The funnerest!,not spongebob,0
More like the worst road trip. My one chance to hear the warbling water lily and you ruined it!,not spongebob,0
"Are you sure about that, Squidward?  Ohh, poor thing just needs some love.",spongebob,1
The warbling water lily!  So beautiful.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts!  We're so happy for you, Squidward!",spongebob,1
Engage Autosnail!,not spongebob,0
"Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!",not spongebob,0
"I got it, I got it! Coming!",spongebob,1
"Hello. Sorry, sir. We're close...",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, there! Krusty Krab, how could I help you?  Pizza?  Ummm... of course we have pizza!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Mr. Krabs...",not spongebob,0
Our delivery squid will bring it right over.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza.  We don't deliver!",not spongebob,0
We don't deliver.  But you do.,not spongebob,0
Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?,not spongebob,0
Great idea! Take him with you.,not spongebob,0
That's not what I had in mind!,not spongebob,0
"Front end... check. Antenna...  check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker...  ...check.  Tire pressure!  ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!",spongebob,1
"Good, then you drive.",not spongebob,0
I can't. I'm still in Boating School.,spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah, but...",spongebob,1
Just do what you do in school.,not spongebob,0
"Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.",spongebob,1
Back it up.,not spongebob,0

"Well, you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else?  We're in the middle of nowhere!",not spongebob,0
And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.,spongebob,1
"And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?!",not spongebob,0
Well... we can still deliver it on foot.,spongebob,1

The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...,spongebob,1
...and my feet are killing me. Whoa!  SpongeBob? What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this is no time for...",not spongebob,0
"Shh, shh, shh. It's working.",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
Truck! Sixteen wheels! Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked.  WheeeeEEEEEeeee... eeeEEEEEeee...,spongebob,1
"Crashin', frashin' break dancers!",not spongebob,0
"He's stopping, he's stopping!",not spongebob,0
The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza  is the pizza free delivery! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty.,spongebob,1
"Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!",not spongebob,0
"I can't, it's for the customer!",spongebob,1
Who cares about the customer?!,not spongebob,0
I do!,spongebob,1
"Well, I don't!",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
Let go of that pizza!,not spongebob,0

"Ow.  SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!",not spongebob,0
No! It's for the customer!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  Let go of the pizza!,not spongebob,0

"SpongeBob!  Hang onto the pizza!  Hey! Hey!  Where's the road? Wh-wh-wh-where's the road?!  We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go???  What are we gonna do now!? There's no road here!",not spongebob,0
I think town's this way.,spongebob,1
"Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?",not spongebob,0
That's right.  Moss always points to civilization.,spongebob,1
"That way? That way there?  So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?",not spongebob,0
Yep.,spongebob,1
"Well, then I'm going this way.",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...",spongebob,1
"Trust me, I know where I'm going.",not spongebob,0
"The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally.  pizza...  pizza...  Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and  me-eeeeee-eee-ee-eeeeeeeeeee!!  Krab Pizza... for you... Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside...",spongebob,1
"Sponge, we gotta eat something.",not spongebob,0
"I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral.  No, maybe it wasn't coral...  ...maybe it was sand... no, no, mud.",spongebob,1
Give me the pizza!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, I remember now. It was coral!",spongebob,1
Give it to me!,not spongebob,0
"No, we promised it's for the customer.",spongebob,1
You're right. It's for the customer.,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
"Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.",not spongebob,0
Well?,spongebob,1
Just a peek.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, it's fine!",spongebob,1
"No, I think I saw something.  Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.",not spongebob,0

What's that? Is that the cheese?,not spongebob,0
Yeah...,spongebob,1
And the pepperoni?,not spongebob,0

That's just a stupid boulder!,not spongebob,0
"It's not just a boulder!!  It's a rock!  A ro-ha-hock! A ra-ha-ha-ha-HA-hock! It's a big beautiful, old rock.  Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae. And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive...  ...rocks. Hold on there, Jethro!",not spongebob,0
I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face!,spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, sir, your Krabby Patty pizza is here!",spongebob,1
"Wow, thanks. I've been dyin' for one of these. It...  Where's my drink?",not spongebob,0
What drink?,spongebob,1
My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!,not spongebob,0
But... you didn't order any drink.,spongebob,1
How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!?,not spongebob,0
But... but...,spongebob,1
"Didn't you ever once think of the customer?!  You call yourself a delivery boy? WELL, I AIN'T BUYIN'.",not spongebob,0
Sponge? Sponge? It's okay... Sponge?  Sponge?,not spongebob,0
"Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't PAYIN' FOR THAT.",not spongebob,0
"Well, this one's ON THE HOUSE!",not spongebob,0
Did he change his mind?,spongebob,1
"He sure did, ate the whole thing in one bite.",not spongebob,0
No drink?,spongebob,1
Nope. Now take me home.,not spongebob,0
Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work!,spongebob,1
"Work...? Oh, my aching tentacles...!",not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day.",not spongebob,0
"Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty.",spongebob,1
"Come on, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard.",spongebob,1
"Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?",not spongebob,0
Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose!,spongebob,1
"You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. .",not spongebob,0
"Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..",spongebob,1
"Okay, give it to me.  Come on SpongeBob, stop it!",not spongebob,0
I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted!,spongebob,1
"Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is...  Plankton! Stealing me booty!",not spongebob,0
"Hear me, Krabs! When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business! I went to college!  Hey! Let me go!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!",not spongebob,0
"You'll pay for this, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Uh... Plankton, sir?",spongebob,1
"Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug?  Okay.  Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Good night, me boy!",not spongebob,0
"Psst... young man.  Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi.",not spongebob,0
Plankton? What do you want?,spongebob,1
"I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?",not spongebob,0
Um... no.,spongebob,1
Acquaintances?,not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
"Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?",not spongebob,0
I... guess so.,spongebob,1
"You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ching!  Sparkle, sparkle.",not spongebob,0
Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.,spongebob,1
"It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? .",not spongebob,0
A booster seat?,spongebob,1
"Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those  tender... delicious... Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!,spongebob,1
"Gee, and I thought you were stupid.",not spongebob,0
"You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool!",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Gary.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you will be mine!",not spongebob,0
"♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪",not spongebob,0
"It should be in here... but where?  Where? Oh...  This will be the beginning of the end!  Ouch! Stupid brain...  Come back here, you swine!  That's it, brain, you're going down!  Yes, yes, that's grand.  And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan.  And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy.",not spongebob,0
Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today.,spongebob,1
I have you now!,not spongebob,0
"Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!",spongebob,1
"Be quiet, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Help!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad?",not spongebob,0
"Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.",not spongebob,0
Mediocre?,not spongebob,0
"You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!",not spongebob,0
Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?,spongebob,1
"Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!",not spongebob,0
Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!,spongebob,1
Never! Never!  Toot toot! How about a little take-out?,not spongebob,0
"No! No, never!  You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula!",spongebob,1
You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no!  There's no one here.",spongebob,1
"Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player?",not spongebob,0
I must fight!,spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it.",not spongebob,0
"Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed.",not spongebob,0
"Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?",not spongebob,0
"I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down,  you delicate little Krabby Patty.",spongebob,1
Mmm...,not spongebob,0
"With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.",spongebob,1
Steamy...,not spongebob,0
"I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns.",spongebob,1
"Yes... yes... yes!  Come to papa!  Oh, boy...",not spongebob,0
"Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas.",not spongebob,0
"Well, this stinks.",not spongebob,0
"Well, patty, I guess we can go home now.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!  Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty!  Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Planky-bear? Plankton?",not spongebob,0
Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there?!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, but I wanted you to show you my new screensaver.  What do you think?",not spongebob,0
Great.,not spongebob,0
You didn't even look.,not spongebob,0
"Ehh...  No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer?  Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!",not spongebob,0
Just tell me if I should permanently upload the screensaver!,not spongebob,0
I said not now–  oww-oww!,not spongebob,0
"Analyzing... 30% mean guy, 20% spiteful monster, 50% evil butt-head. Sample is... 100% big jerk.  I have also analyzed your screensaver, Karen. It is most beautiful!",not spongebob,0
"No one asked you!  Are you happy now, Karen?",not spongebob,0
"No, I'm not! I was just trying to make myself pretty for you, but do you even care? All you ever do is make stupid schemes about stupid sandwiches!",not spongebob,0
Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!,not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!",not spongebob,0
You know what? No one talks to me like that! Get out!,not spongebob,0
"I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me...  leave!  Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said.",not spongebob,0
I accept your apology.,not spongebob,0
"I wasn't taking to you, idiot!  Pain!  Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!",not spongebob,0
"Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!",not spongebob,0
So is it cool if I crash here?,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Then can I just use your bathroom?,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!",spongebob,1
Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom.,not spongebob,0
Suit yourself.,spongebob,1
"Okay, fine!",not spongebob,0
Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.,not spongebob,0
"Silly, that's not my bathroom.",spongebob,1
"Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?",spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!  We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair?,spongebob,1
"Oh, forget this!",not spongebob,0
Many unbearable hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my love, what a fool I've been. You've always been the only one for me.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out.",spongebob,1
Threw me out? I threw her in!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings.  Oh, somebody's tense!",spongebob,1
"Hey! What? Get off! Get—Oh!  Oh, that's the spot.",not spongebob,0
"Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight.",spongebob,1
"I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!",spongebob,1
But I'm the best.,not spongebob,0
"Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive.",spongebob,1
"Me, aggressive?! How dare you?!  Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person!  I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, in a word: yes!",spongebob,1
What is that dimwit doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!",not spongebob,0
Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.,not spongebob,0
Oh. Thanks!,not spongebob,0
"All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this.  After you.",spongebob,1
"I'm happy, SpongeBob!  Can someone get me out of here?  Whew!",not spongebob,0
"All right, Plankton. Now you try!",spongebob,1
"Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it.  Ugh. After you.",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Try this one.,spongebob,1
After you.,not spongebob,0
But I can't fit through there.,not spongebob,0
How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, no!",spongebob,1
Can someone get me out of here?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice.",spongebob,1
Easy!,not spongebob,0
Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice.,spongebob,1
Say something nice.,spongebob,1
"Uh... Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.",not spongebob,0
"No, try again.",spongebob,1
Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.,not spongebob,0
Thanks! I like... um... your antennas.,not spongebob,0
What? What's wrong with my antennas?!,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, right! You two are mocking me!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?",not spongebob,0
"No, I think we better try something else.",spongebob,1
"It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!",spongebob,1
Brother.,not spongebob,0
"Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart.",spongebob,1
That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit!,not spongebob,0
That wasn't even close to what I said.,spongebob,1
Sure it was. And I know just how to do it.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I feel uncomfortable.",spongebob,1
"Plankton, are you sure about this?",spongebob,1
"Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I like that!  Boop beep! Beep boop boop!",spongebob,1
Welcome to the Chum Bucket!  Oh. It's you. What do you want?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot.",not spongebob,0
Beep boop!,spongebob,1
"Hmm.  Mm-hmm. Shelby Naughtica, huh? Oh, what a beautiful name.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you!  Ow!  I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!",spongebob,1
I'll be right back with our lovers' special.,not spongebob,0
"This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!",not spongebob,0
"Here we go. I whipped up a special batch of chum for you, and for your lovely robot date, a bucket of grease chock-full of nuts and bolts.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, I don't want to eat this!",spongebob,1
"Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob, just eat it!",not spongebob,0
"Ugh.  Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton-poo, you say the sweetest things!",spongebob,1
"Oh, brother.",not spongebob,0
I never knew what love was until I met you!,not spongebob,0
Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!,spongebob,1
"Hey, you! Get your hands off my man!",not spongebob,0
"You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies.",spongebob,1
"1,000 what??!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, you're really in love. I won't stand in your way. Plankton's all yours.",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,spongebob,1
"No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me.",spongebob,1
"Wait a second. You're not just being a jerk? You mean, you cooked this whole stupid scheme up to win me back?",not spongebob,0
"Of course I did.  I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that is so sweet!",spongebob,1
"Get over here, you.",not spongebob,0
"Eww, it's that fat screensaver again.",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Now, Karen, take it easy!",not spongebob,0
I'm gonna go now.,spongebob,1
My motherboard was right about you! She warned me about you! And I should've listened to her!,not spongebob,0
"Now, we all know what this day is.",not spongebob,0
"Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir!",spongebob,1
Like he does every day.,not spongebob,0
"But this time, he's not going to catch me with me spatula down!  Ooh?  SpongeBob, you're on guard duty, boy!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
And I'll go undercover.,not spongebob,0
"Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪",spongebob,1
Oh!,not spongebob,0
Three hours later...,not spongebob,0
♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪,spongebob,1
Ow.,not spongebob,0
Any sign of Plankton?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Maybe he's on vacation.,not spongebob,0
"Don't be silly! We always take our trips together,  to keep an eye on each other. What's taking that crook so long?  Hm... Maybe the door is stuck.  Ah, for—these customers are blocking the way!  There we go. Nice, open path.  Hm? Mm... Hey! Well, maybe he just needs a little incentive.  There we go.  Maybe he doesn't want me formula anymore.  He took the bait! We're going to red alert!  Batten down the hatches! Furl the deck! Stop that greedy green goober!",not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
Doggone it!  Can I get some ketchup over here? Please?,not spongebob,0
False alarm.,not spongebob,0
Closing time!,not spongebob,0
And just where do you think you two are going?,not spongebob,0
It's customary to go home at closing time.,not spongebob,0
"Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm not budging. Plankton is gonna try something. I don't know when. I don't know where.",not spongebob,0
Probably...here.,not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah. But when he does, I'll be waiting for him.",not spongebob,0
I'll be waiting right here.,not spongebob,0
The next morning...,not spongebob,0
Morning! Hm?  I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.,spongebob,1
"No, I'm still here...  Waiting for that blasted Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'll take—",not spongebob,0
"Me patty formula?! Huh? I knew it! You in there, Plankton?!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!",spongebob,1
"I will never set foot in this establishment again!  From now on, I'm using the drive-thru!",not spongebob,0
"Aha! Trying to sneak a Krabby Patty to Plankton, eh?",not spongebob,0
"But, Eugene, it's just a to-go order.",not spongebob,0
"Well, from now on, all patties are to be eaten on the premises!",not spongebob,0
"What are you gonna do now, ban pockets?",not spongebob,0
"Capital idea, Mr. Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"There'll be a $50-a-barrel surcharge from now on!  Whoa, hey, slow down there, Grandpa. Let me see here.  Aha! Another one of Plankton's spies!",not spongebob,0
I just wanted some for later.,not spongebob,0
You're banned!  Hm... So Plankton's recruiting baby burglars now!  Put a cork in it!  You're banned!  You! You're banned! You're banned! Banned!  Banned!  You're all banned!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming.",spongebob,1
Nonsense!  See? It's that stinker Plankton now! What do you want?,not spongebob,0
Uh...A Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
Why?,not spongebob,0
I'm hungry.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy.",spongebob,1
I'm not falling for it.  That's the worst squirrel suit I've ever seen.,not spongebob,0
Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting...strange?,spongebob,1
He seems fine to me.,not spongebob,0
Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.,spongebob,1
Plans?! Aha! You're both working for Plankton! Get out of me restaurant you tricky treacherous traitors!,not spongebob,0
"I know you're in here, Plankton. Where are you hiding?",not spongebob,0
I'm right here...  at the Chum Bucket! Come on down and try our new Chum Nuggets.,not spongebob,0
Heh.  Whew.  Oh.  Just a—just a cup.,not spongebob,0
Get ahold of yourself. Get ahold of yourself.  I'm starting to see things.,not spongebob,0
Huh?  Those two are working for Plankton!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Me own daughter?  Oh, not Old Man Jenkins!  Everyone really is out to get you. Aren't they, my little formula?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to... the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.,spongebob,1
"Oh, so that's Plankton's evil plan? He wants me formula as ransom! What do we do? What? What's that?  Oh, that's just brilliant! Hold on a minute. I'll go get the ransom.  Oh, you want a Krabby Patty, do you? Well, I'll give you a Krabby Patty.  Okay, let's go rescue Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Surprised, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Not at all, Sheldon. I knew you were up to something.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? How about now?",not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come, Krabs. It's the anniversary of the first time I tried to steal your Krabby Patty formula!",not spongebob,0
"So, we threw you a surprise party.",spongebob,1
You mean you weren't working for Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
"Of course not, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I shouldn't have suspected you, SpongeBob! Whew. Won't need these anymore.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy, Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
Yee-haw!,not spongebob,0
No! Don't eat the patties!  Gotcha.,not spongebob,0
"Whew.  Ah, tartar sauce!",not spongebob,0
Yay.,not spongebob,0
A little help here!,not spongebob,0
"Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Eh, I'll tell you in a second.",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  Ooh, that fool Krabs left the Krabby Patty formula behind!  Mommy.",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,spongebob,1
"Yes, boy-o. I enjoyed it very much.",not spongebob,0
pisodeTr/58b,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe.",not spongebob,0
"Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!",not spongebob,0
"Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!",spongebob,1
What's all the yelling about?,not spongebob,0
Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.,not spongebob,0
Can I have the secret formula?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
But he was persistent!,not spongebob,0
Pretty please?,not spongebob,0
Uh-uh.,not spongebob,0
He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!,not spongebob,0
Fascinating.,not spongebob,0
"But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.",not spongebob,0
What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?,not spongebob,0
"With pleasure, sir!",spongebob,1
"I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.",not spongebob,0
You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"No, thank you.  Will this cover it?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, sure.  Here you go.",not spongebob,0
Good day.,not spongebob,0
"Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.",not spongebob,0
AHA!,not spongebob,0
Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!",not spongebob,0
Or what?,not spongebob,0
...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.,not spongebob,0
"Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move.",not spongebob,0
"Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",not spongebob,0
And now for the chaser.,not spongebob,0
"You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands.",not spongebob,0
So? Tell me what happened.,not spongebob,0
I don't want to talk about it.,not spongebob,0
Talking will make you feel better.,not spongebob,0
Leave me alone.,not spongebob,0
"That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...",not spongebob,0
"And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.",not spongebob,0
You have to do everything yourself...,not spongebob,0
"...and that's why everything you try ends up like this...  and like this...  and more recently, like this.",not spongebob,0
I'm a failure!,not spongebob,0
It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...,not spongebob,0
Henchmen?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.",not spongebob,0
"I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting.  Sorry.",not spongebob,0
"That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  THEY'RE HERE! Welcome, brethren!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!",not spongebob,0
Yee-haw!,not spongebob,0
I've been away from home longer than I thought.,not spongebob,0
"Well, howdy, cousin!",not spongebob,0
Uh...,not spongebob,0
"It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... ... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior...",not spongebob,0
"Alright! I get it! ...I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.",not spongebob,0
"Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.",not spongebob,0
Sheldon?!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, that's my first name.",not spongebob,0
Sheldon?,not spongebob,0
Will you please-!,not spongebob,0
Sorry!,not spongebob,0
"All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.",not spongebob,0
"Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  AHA!  Okay, that's enough!",not spongebob,0
Sheldon! Ha Ha!,not spongebob,0
Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?,not spongebob,0
But what's in it for us?,not spongebob,0
"Well, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo?,not spongebob,0
And another boot to match this'n?,not spongebob,0
And some more memory for my laptop!,not spongebob,0
And what about root beer?,not spongebob,0
Root beer!?!?!,not spongebob,0
"Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...",not spongebob,0
"Attention, Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, you and what army, bug?",not spongebob,0
"What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
You planted grass?,not spongebob,0
Grass?!?,not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.",not spongebob,0
"Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...",not spongebob,0
"Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!",not spongebob,0
"Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!",not spongebob,0
Ahem.,not spongebob,0
"Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.",not spongebob,0
Begging won't help.,not spongebob,0
"I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.",not spongebob,0
Eye.,not spongebob,0
Eye.,not spongebob,0
"I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good!  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!",not spongebob,0
Plankton! Wait!,not spongebob,0
...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!,not spongebob,0
I'm warning ya...!,not spongebob,0
...A cup of love...!,not spongebob,0
Don't do it!,not spongebob,0
...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
...I warned ya.,not spongebob,0
Hey. Why ain't you running?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I can't read!",not spongebob,0
Get out of here!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?",not spongebob,0
"Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.",not spongebob,0
"Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.",not spongebob,0
"Curse you, Squidwaaaaaaaaard!",not spongebob,0
The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.,spongebob,1
"Good job, laddy, another fruitful day pushing patties.",not spongebob,0
Push-a-what?,spongebob,1
"You know, turning patties into lettuce.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I'm not following you.",spongebob,1
"Cabbage, green backs, money!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you mean your obsession.",spongebob,1
"Obsession is kind of a strong word.  Sleep tight, me little angels.",not spongebob,0
"35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open, says me!  Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?",not spongebob,0
"What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order. The safe is still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things. Hey, how'd that pickle end up on the floor?  Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. Waste not, whnt not.",not spongebob,0
Approximately 10 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Plankton, where have you been?!",not spongebob,0
"Trust me, you do not want to know.",not spongebob,0
Did you get the Krabby Patty formula? Like I have to ask.,not spongebob,0
"No, and I probably never will.",not spongebob,0
You need a more positive outlook!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Karen, if only you could just see things way I do.",not spongebob,0
Plankton!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
I think you hit it! You couldn't see the correct combination because you have only one eye. You lack depth perception.,not spongebob,0
Maybe you're right. That would explain why I stink at darts.,not spongebob,0
What you need is a second eye.,not spongebob,0
"Karen, my dear, I think you're on to something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!",not spongebob,0
"Success!  Uh oh, that ain't good.  No, no, no, no no no nо nо nо no! I can see every-",not spongebob,0
"Binocular vision, here I come!   What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you!  Oh, come on, please stop!  Next.",not spongebob,0
"Karen, what am I doing wrong?",not spongebob,0
Your experiments are missing essential one ingredient.,not spongebob,0
"It's not love, is it? ‘Cause you know I hate that stuff.",not spongebob,0
"No, it's cells from another eye. Even a single teardrop would contain enough DNA.",not spongebob,0
"Tears, huh? I guess if I have to.  Ow! Will these do?",not spongebob,0
"No, silly. They have to be from somebody who already has two eyes.",not spongebob,0
"Two eyes, huh? I think I know a crybaby who fits that description!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Plankton!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?",not spongebob,0
"No, not particularly.",spongebob,1
"Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt. The end.",not spongebob,0
S-s-s-sad story! And so timely!,spongebob,1
Get a grip!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk!",spongebob,1
Are you sure you want to go through with this?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!  Mommy! Here comes the pain!  That wasn't so bad. Uh-oh, here we go.  Eureka!",not spongebob,0
"So, does it work?",not spongebob,0
You tell me.  Bullseye! Now for my next target – the Krabby Patty secret formula!  Hahahaha!  Wha-?  Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful?!,not spongebob,0
La la la la!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?",spongebob,1
"I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, buh-bye!",spongebob,1
"Honey, I'm home!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're a happy camper. Did you finally steal the formula?",not spongebob,0
"Formula, what formula?  I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.",not spongebob,0
It's that new eye of yours. Your evil DNA has become corrupted by SpongeBob's nice DNA. You've gone from evil.. To neevil! You're becoming as harmless as that fry cook.,not spongebob,0
"Nonsense, You're imagining things.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, really? Let's test it, shall we? Tell me what you see in these ink blots.",not spongebob,0
Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!,not spongebob,0
Nope. Try again. What does this remind you of?,not spongebob,0
"Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!",not spongebob,0
Try this!,not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
I'll give you a hint.,not spongebob,0
"A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?",not spongebob,0
Cells from that sponge have changed your whole point of view.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula.",not spongebob,0
Such lovely destruction!,not spongebob,0
Help! Save me!  Save me!,not spongebob,0
"I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!",not spongebob,0
Comin' down.,not spongebob,0
Oh no.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, buddy!",not spongebob,0
Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula.  What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Uh-wha.. Krabs must have lost it!,not spongebob,0
"And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Eugene! You missing anything?",not spongebob,0
Me Krabby Patty Formula!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground!  So I'm giving it back to you, take it.",not spongebob,0
"Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns.  Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?",not spongebob,0
Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!,not spongebob,0
Since when do you care about stealing?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again.  Hahaha, I did it!",not spongebob,0
"You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!",spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"My life of evil is over.  Hey, why is it so dark in here?",not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
"The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, never!",not spongebob,0
"This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!",spongebob,1
"What, no! Not hugs!  It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, glad I could help.",spongebob,1
"Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation, I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers!  Oh, well. Depth perception's overrated anyway.",not spongebob,0
Order up!,spongebob,1
Here.,not spongebob,0
Goo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, there.",not spongebob,0
"Num, num!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, does baby want a Krabby Patty, hmm?",not spongebob,0
Awww.,not spongebob,0
Baby's first Krabby Patty.,spongebob,1
That diabolical fiend!,not spongebob,0
I can't believe this is working! It's like taking candy from a baby — with a baby.,not spongebob,0
"Stop right there, you thievin' infant!",not spongebob,0
Yi-eeh! That's harsh.,spongebob,1
"So you thought you could pull a fast one, eh?  Now, come out of there, you little pest!",not spongebob,0
What's he doing? You leave that poor baby alone!,not spongebob,0
Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, no! Don't do it!",spongebob,1
Ooh! Oh...,not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, calm down! It's just Plankton.  See?",not spongebob,0
Uh... goo-goo?,not spongebob,0
How dare you! You toyed with our emotions!,not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Face it, Plankton. You're never gonna win. I'll always be one step... ahead.  Now, why don't you go back to where you came from, you little brat?",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh.,not spongebob,0
You monster! How dare you!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, diddums failed to get a Krabby Patty again?",not spongebob,0
"Stop patronizing me! Why does every single plan fall apart? It's just a stupid sandwich! I tell you, it's wearing me down!",not spongebob,0
You need to stop obsessing over it.  Relax. Get a hobby or something.,not spongebob,0
"I hate to admit it, computer wife, but you're probably right. I need something to take my mind off that blasted secret formula for a while.  But what?",not spongebob,0
I know. How about taking care of an inferior life-form?,not spongebob,0
You mean a pet? That's a great idea! But how will I find a pet that fits my dynamic personality?,not spongebob,0
Plankton!  I have the perfect solution to your problem.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? How could you possibly help me?,not spongebob,0
You should try the local animal shelter. That's where I found my Gary.,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah? Perhaps you're on to something there.",not spongebob,0
"Here it is. The Bikini Bottom Animal Shelter.  Your perfect pet awaits. Now, if you just listen to your heart, you'll be able to pick out the right pet as soon as you see it.",spongebob,1
Hmm. Too big.  Too sloppy.,not spongebob,0
Duh...,not spongebob,0
Too stupid.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.  Oh! Oh! What about this one?",spongebob,1
"Are you kidding me? Algae on a rock? I want a pet, not a plant. It's no use.  There's nothing for me here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! Plankton!",spongebob,1
"You know, I can't say I'm surprised.",not spongebob,0
"Hey there, little guy.  Looks like we have a winner!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, so cute! Whatcha gonna call him? He looks like a Spot to me.",spongebob,1
That name provokes a violent reaction. Spot it is!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Spot, I'm your new owner, so shower me with love and affection.  Karen, it's not giving me unconditional love. I think it's defective.",not spongebob,0
You're gonna have to train him to do that.,not spongebob,0
"I train him?  I'll give it a shot. All right, Spot. Let's start with something easy. Stay.  Good boy. Now sit.  Very good! Now roll over.  Excellent! Now shake.  Wow! That's one mean shake you got there. I think we should burn off some of that extra energy. Would you like to go walkies?  I'll assume that's a yes.  March!  Phew. We must've walked for miles.  I guess our legs are too short for walkies. How about a nice round of fetch?  Fetch!  Oh no. What have I done? I'm a terrible pet owner! Terrible! Karen! We're gonna need another Spot!  Nice rebound, Spot! You know, I get squished a lot too.  I hope nobody saw that emotional outburst.",not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
Shoo!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Spot. Today, you'll learn how to be an attack pet to guard the Chum Bucket from intruders. Now, Spot, pretend I'm a burglar.  Attack!  You're not getting this? Come at me! Uh-oh... losing balance!  A little help?  On second thought, what do I need a guard dog for? I can't even give chum away. What I really need is a retriever.  This is your target. I want you to retrieve the Krabby Patty. Now, security is tight, so I've devised a pl--  Wait! Where are you going? You're not ready!",not spongebob,0
I'd like a large...  What was that?,not spongebob,0
"Didn't see it, don't care.",not spongebob,0
"Holy plot twist! It's a Krabby Patty! It's... a miracle!  Karen, look at what Spot brought home!",not spongebob,0
That's wonderful! Spot deserves a reward.,not spongebob,0
"He can have anything he wants, up to half my kingdom – uh, laboratory.",not spongebob,0
I think he wants your Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"No! No! You've been a very bad amoeba! Bad amoeba! I'm afraid you'll have to be punished! You need a time out. I'm just gonna tie you up out here until you learn to behave!  Shouldn't take more than five minutes.  Aww... no, no, I must be strong!  I can't do it!  Spot, I'm sorry! I —  Spot! He's gone!  Where is he? Spot! Come back!  Spot! Come back! Spot! Come back! I've got to find him!",not spongebob,0
Awww!,not spongebob,0
"Don't any of you have jobs?  Spot! Spot! Where are you, Spot?",not spongebob,0
"Why, Plankton, what's wrong?",spongebob,1
I lost Spot.,not spongebob,0
"That's terrible! Gary lost me once.  I was cold, alone, starving. It was the worst eight minutes of my life. Come on, Plankton, let's find your pet.",spongebob,1
"Lost pet! Anyone seen this lost pet?  Lost pet emergency! Be on the lookout for a lost pet! Pardon me, sir.  Have you seen this amoeba?",spongebob,1
You mean that little speck?,not spongebob,0
No. That little speck.,spongebob,1
Is this him?,not spongebob,0
"No, that's a piece of gum.",not spongebob,0
"Gum?  I've been looking everywhere for this!  If I was lookin' for a lost pet, I'd try the animal shelter.",not spongebob,0
Of course!,not spongebob,0
The shelter!,not spongebob,0
"I think it's closed for the night.  Ooh, it's dark in here. I'll find a light switch. Aha!  Nope, that's not it.  Aha! Found the lights.",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob? What was the first switch for?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. I think it unlocks the pens?,spongebob,1
I thought so. Because now the animals are loose!   SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Run for it?,spongebob,1
Yep.,not spongebob,0
I think we lost 'em.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, before we're torn to shreds, I'd like to thank you for helping me look for Spot.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, it was nothing. Hey, speaking of Spot. Did you always have a double pupil?",spongebob,1
"A double what?  Spot!  Thank entropy you're safe! You were hiding on my optical cornea the whole time! You sneaky little amoeba, you.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, I'm glad you found Spot.  Unfortunately, the animals found us too.",spongebob,1
"Good-bye, Spot. I guess this is the end of the road for us.  Spot, no!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Spot! You saved us!",spongebob,1
I taught him everything he knows!,not spongebob,0
What is going on here?!,not spongebob,0
What's wrong now?,not spongebob,0
"Same as always, look, empty again!",not spongebob,0
So what are you gonna do about it?,not spongebob,0
I don't know anymore!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey, why don't you just work on a new recipe?",not spongebob,0
What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years!,not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick.",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks.",not spongebob,0
You're kidding right?,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, okay if you insist.  Oh, no, please don't sue me!  I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum!",not spongebob,0
"Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow.  Here you go. See you in the morning.",not spongebob,0
Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!,not spongebob,0
How'd you pull that off?,not spongebob,0
"Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me, Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more.  Now, I wait. I wait until he returns.  I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.",not spongebob,0
8 hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What?  Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Well, hello, Nat!",not spongebob,0
I came back like I said yesterday.,not spongebob,0
"You certainly did, didn't you?",not spongebob,0
"I'd like another Chum Stick, please.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
Is it okay?,not spongebob,0
"Okay?!  It's perfection!  Hey, how about I have another?",not spongebob,0
You betcha!,not spongebob,0
"Whoo, boy! I cannot believe how good these things are.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, you know.",not spongebob,0
"All right, see you tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
What?! You're coming back again?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge!",not spongebob,0
"♪Rolling, rolling, rolling! Money keeps on rolling along!♪  One more time!  No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time or any time!",not spongebob,0
Don't bother. There's no need.,not spongebob,0
What are you talking about?,not spongebob,0
"I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.",not spongebob,0
"You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?",not spongebob,0
"But of course, loyal customer.  I'll see you later, loser. Much later!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you can count on me, sir.  Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here.  Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?",spongebob,1
No thanks.,not spongebob,0
"Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oaf. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, do me a favor.  From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, fishpaste!",spongebob,1
"Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet chum.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Your Diminutiveness.",not spongebob,0
"Say, Nat, do you have any friends?",not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"Would you hurry up with that chum, Karen?!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop.  There's your chum, bleep blap blop.",spongebob,1
"Hey, this doesn't look like chum.",not spongebob,0
And that doesn't look like Karen!,not spongebob,0
"Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me.",spongebob,1
"What have you done with Karen, you brute?!",not spongebob,0
"How many times do I have to tell you?  I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I love chum! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else!",not spongebob,0
So you're saying that you love chum? And all that you ever eat is chum?,spongebob,1
Yeah! Th-that's right!,not spongebob,0
Interesting.,spongebob,1
A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me.,not spongebob,0
"Welcome, valued customer!",not spongebob,0
This isn't the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
Why go to the Chum Bucket when the Krusty Krab has added tasty chum to our menu?,not spongebob,0
"That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand chum.",not spongebob,0
"But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say?  You like it?",not spongebob,0
It's...,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
It's...,not spongebob,0
"Well, what do you think?",not spongebob,0
It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted!  I'm going back to Plankton's chum.,not spongebob,0
What am I going to do?! I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer!  I just can't afford it!,not spongebob,0
I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.,spongebob,1
"But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum.  That's it boyo!  Where could it be?  There! Plankton's secret formula!  It's gotta be in here...",not spongebob,0
"What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
"Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.",not spongebob,0
"Ouch, double irony!",not spongebob,0
"Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist.  I mean, just think about that.  You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the...",spongebob,1
Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.,not spongebob,0
"Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash.",not spongebob,0
Look at all that loot!,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my chum!",not spongebob,0
"D'oh, just put me out of me misery!",not spongebob,0
"Back for more of my delicious chum, I see!",not spongebob,0
Not this time.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Not ever again!  The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!",not spongebob,0
Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?,not spongebob,0
"I have eaten ten of those things, and I've all ready had to go to the doctor...twice!  If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again.",not spongebob,0
"What's the deal, Karen?",not spongebob,0
"The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining.",not spongebob,0
"All this time, I never had one regular customer?",not spongebob,0
Duh.,not spongebob,0
Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, there he goes again. Cut it out, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me!",not spongebob,0
"Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!",spongebob,1
What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed meself more! This irony's pretty good stuff!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, Seanut Brittle - gimmie!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?",spongebob,1
"Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!  Where's the Seanut Brittle?",not spongebob,0
"That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.",spongebob,1
Seanut Brittle?,not spongebob,0
"Ah!  Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.  Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see!  Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Hey, Seanut Brittle!  Oh, darn it, not again!",not spongebob,0
"Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?",not spongebob,0
"Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.",spongebob,1
"Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick.  That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.",not spongebob,0
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.,not spongebob,0
"You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.",spongebob,1
"Well, this came in just this morning.  Have some gum.  Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.",not spongebob,0
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
What can we get for one dollar?,spongebob,1
One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar -  fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.,not spongebob,0
What else have you got?,spongebob,1
A whoopee cushion.,not spongebob,0
Nah.,spongebob,1
Fake vomit.,not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
Real vomit?,not spongebob,0
Eugghh. Don't you have anything good?,spongebob,1
"Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster.  Invisible Spray!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, invisible spray!",spongebob,1
But I can see it.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.",spongebob,1
"Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.",spongebob,1
What are we gonna do with it?,not spongebob,0
"I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.",spongebob,1
They're floating in midair!,not spongebob,0
How do they do that?,not spongebob,0
"That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Well, let's get started.",spongebob,1
"Okay, I'm ready.",not spongebob,0
Any particular reason you took your pants off?,spongebob,1
"Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?",not spongebob,0
"That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second.  Okay, Patrick, give me the can.",spongebob,1
"I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!",not spongebob,0
Give me that thing.,spongebob,1
"Hey, the invisible spray works!",not spongebob,0
"And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!",not spongebob,0
"Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!",spongebob,1
"I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.",not spongebob,0
"Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?",spongebob,1
Yeah.  I see what you mean.,not spongebob,0
"No guts, no glory!",spongebob,1
Several bad puns later...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I think I found our pants.  Oops! Here, these are yours.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?",not spongebob,0
"Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.",spongebob,1
"Gee, it's getting late.",not spongebob,0
"Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?",spongebob,1
"Sure.  It's, uh, ten to three.",not spongebob,0
Thank you.,spongebob,1
Don't mention it.,not spongebob,0
Don't mention what?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, who said that?",not spongebob,0
Me.,not spongebob,0
AHHH! GHOSTS!,not spongebob,0
Aaahhh!!,not spongebob,0
Hey! I'm no ghost. The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.,not spongebob,0
"Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.",spongebob,1
Lay it on me.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, we're invisible, right?",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.",spongebob,1
Whoo! High five!,not spongebob,0
Let's go scare us some suckers.,spongebob,1
"Huh?  Well, that's funny. I thought I heard voices. Huh?  I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.  And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?!",not spongebob,0
We're ghoooosts.,not spongebob,0
"I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, we really scared her!",spongebob,1
Who's gonna be our next victim?,not spongebob,0
"A better question would be, who isn't?",spongebob,1
Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake!  You will soon be mine.  Oh!  GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSTS!!!!!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
GHOSTS!!!,not spongebob,0
COWaAaBuuUUnggaAAaaAaaAA!!!,not spongebob,0

Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
Toast.,not spongebob,0
Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
It's official - we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
It says he isn't scared of ghosts.,not spongebob,0
We'll see about that!,spongebob,1
"Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts. Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot!  Got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down!  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor... and if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on!",not spongebob,0
KraaaAAAAbBBbsss!,not spongebob,0
Wha?,not spongebob,0
"Krabs, we've come to haunt yooOOOOuuUUUuuu!",spongebob,1
"Stay back, I'm well-armed!",not spongebob,0
I'm warning ya!,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
Boo.,not spongebob,0
I gotta get out of here!,not spongebob,0
"You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.",spongebob,1
You'll never get me!,not spongebob,0
"Nice try, Krabs, but we've replaced all the glass with rubber!",not spongebob,0
"Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.",spongebob,1
"Please, spirits, leave me be.",not spongebob,0
"We got him good, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs.",spongebob,1
"No, spirits, please!",not spongebob,0
Pay!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
PaaAAAAyyYYyyy!,spongebob,1
"NOOOO!!!!! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick!",not spongebob,0
I know not these names of which you speak.,spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again.",not spongebob,0
So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts?,not spongebob,0
"We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.",spongebob,1
"Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.",spongebob,1
"Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.",spongebob,1
Me too.,not spongebob,0
"Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.",spongebob,1
Don't mention it.,not spongebob,0
"That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Tom, Bill, Mrs. Puff, Sandy, Squidward, Horace, Harold, Nathiel Waters, the red shirt Frank, Jimmy-Gus, Sadie, Nat, Nazz-Mimi, Purple Scooter, Dennis Rechid, Martin, an anchovy, two Frankie Billys, Clay, and Franco.]",not spongebob,0
The Krusty Krab presents: LIVE NUDE PRANKSTERS!  Starring the Bikini Bottom Ghosts!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
We should have bought the whoopee cushion!,spongebob,1
"There we go! SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra...  SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!",not spongebob,0
I am raking the leaves.,spongebob,1
But they're still all over the ground!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves.",spongebob,1
Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!,not spongebob,0
"What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"I told ya, SpongeBob...  I'm hibernating next week.",not spongebob,0
Hibernating? What's that?,spongebob,1
It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.,not spongebob,0
Can I do that?,spongebob,1
"No, silly. It's a mammalian thing.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.",spongebob,1
"Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!",not spongebob,0
"Why, Sandy? When does your... carburation begin?",spongebob,1
In one week!,not spongebob,0
"But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!",spongebob,1
You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!,not spongebob,0
Climb!,spongebob,1
We gotta jump off of stuff!,not spongebob,0
Jump!,spongebob,1
We gotta ride!,not spongebob,0
Ride!,spongebob,1
I don't wanna go to sleep yet!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Sandy!",spongebob,1
I can't burn carbs in my sleep!,not spongebob,0
Sandy?,spongebob,1
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands!  Yee-ha!",not spongebob,0
Uh... I can explain.,not spongebob,0
I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.",not spongebob,0
Ready?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, there once was a sandman...",not spongebob,0
Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!,spongebob,1
Maybe we didn't sing it right.,not spongebob,0
"Yeahhh...  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow.",spongebob,1
"I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best prehibernation week ever.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night, Gary.",spongebob,1
"Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?,spongebob,1
"I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun.  Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour!  Isn't this GREAT?!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I've never played extreme jacks before!",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun! We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off!  On your mark... get set...",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?",spongebob,1
"Go!  Come on, SpongeBob, we're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, that sounds safe!...I mean, fun.  Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"I did, SpongeBob: the industrial park!  This is where the real action is!  This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke!  We're going fly-fishin'!",not spongebob,0
"This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.",spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to...",spongebob,1
"Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite!  Find the hay in the needle stack!",not spongebob,0

"Hey, SpongeBo-ob!  …Well, at least I still have my personality.",not spongebob,0
Check in this here moist cave!,not spongebob,0
Status report!,not spongebob,0
He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove...,not spongebob,0
"Well, look again!",not spongebob,0
He's not at the leech farm!,not spongebob,0
"Well, look again!",not spongebob,0
He's not in my thoughts.,not spongebob,0
"Well, THINK AGAIN!  Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!",not spongebob,0
How about a break? We've been at it for days!,not spongebob,0
Think about the children!,not spongebob,0
That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.,not spongebob,0
This is a load of barnacles...,not spongebob,0
I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!!,not spongebob,0
"Uh... uh, wait!  Uh, here he is!",not spongebob,0
That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!,not spongebob,0

"Oh, look! He's up in the sky!",not spongebob,0
"He's not...huh?  They must have gone to search some more.  SpongeBob, where are you?!  You under there?!  Nope!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, I can explain.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?!  Nope!  Nope!  Nope! SPONGEBOB!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!?!,not spongebob,0
That squirrel's gone crazy.,not spongebob,0
But she'll never look under a rock.,not spongebob,0
"Ahahaha, you said it! Sandy'll never find us!  Hey, wait, you don't understand!",spongebob,1
"Oh, look! It is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"AAAAAHHH! C'MON, LET ME BACK IN! You don't understand!",spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened!  Come on! There's just enough time to go atom smashing!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, wait!",spongebob,1
There's no time to wait!! HIBERNATION!!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important!  I...am a man!  Okay, Sandy, I...I...I-I-I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE! I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GAMES!! THEY'RE TEARING ME APART!!!  There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...",spongebob,1
"Sandy?  I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation!",spongebob,1
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!?!,not spongebob,0
"You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.",not spongebob,0
"Yup, and just relax.",spongebob,1
Yeah. Relax.,not spongebob,0
OOOH! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
A flower.,spongebob,1
"They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.",not spongebob,0
They sure do.,spongebob,1
"You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.",not spongebob,0
Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?,spongebob,1
"Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
Me.,not spongebob,0
"That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.",spongebob,1
Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?,not spongebob,0
I thought that meant you were nuts.,spongebob,1
"Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.",not spongebob,0
"Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby. And if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you say to that, Miss Mittens?",spongebob,1
I'd say I'm already halfway there!,not spongebob,0
"Aaaaah!  No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!",spongebob,1

What's she blabbering about?,not spongebob,0
She says land creatures are best.,not spongebob,0

A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink.  Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay.  Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At.

It's only 6 o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go.  I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics?",spongebob,1

Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits?  Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen.  Hmmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage.  Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... 10 o'clock?! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!  I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and...  done.

Uh... Marco!,spongebob,1
Polo!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write?  Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy?  I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper!  Now they're floating around my thinking space.  So long, pesky particles!  I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water!  That was a close one.",spongebob,1

"What do you mean 'overly dramatic', Gary?  All that choking sure made me hungry.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese  A visitor? For me!?  Hello!",spongebob,1
Package for Mr. SquarePants.,not spongebob,0
"Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?",spongebob,1
It puts bread on the table.,not spongebob,0
Rye or pumpernickel?,spongebob,1
"Oh, brother..",not spongebob,0
"So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...",spongebob,1
Don't you have a paper to write?,not spongebob,0
How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay?,spongebob,1
"In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off.  When will he learn?",not spongebob,0

No!  What have I done?!  Help! Help! My house is on fire!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay? Stop wasting time!",not spongebob,0
"Where's my essay! Oh, there you are!  I must have dozed off.  Lets see where are we?  Do I dare look at the clock...  It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight!  And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep...  Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is!  Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?",spongebob,1

"I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention!",not spongebob,0
But what about my essay?,spongebob,1
I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!,not spongebob,0
Nope. Nothing.  I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early.  Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal.,not spongebob,0
You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?,not spongebob,0
"When he goes, you can go.",not spongebob,0
"Grr!  Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you.  What? No tip? Finally! Yes!  Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening!  Cause it's not.",not spongebob,0
"Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.",not spongebob,0
Old navy days?! Ohh!,spongebob,1
"That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past.  There, now. The lights are properly dimmed.  Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies  as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.",not spongebob,0
I don't want any hair on my chest.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I do!",spongebob,1
"It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling!  And me ship was being tossed about,  like a rag doll on a trampoline!  I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall!  It was just then that he bursts into the galley!",not spongebob,0
Who he?,spongebob,1
"The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare!  The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman!  They called him,  Captain Scarfish!",not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,spongebob,1
"Stand at attention, Mr. Krabs!  I want you to tell me the meaning of this!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir.",not spongebob,0
"This is the navy, son! We don't cut the crusts off! We eat the crusts and throw the rest away!",not spongebob,0
But that's... That's madness!,not spongebob,0
I'm telling you for the last time! You're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious!,not spongebob,0
But I don't know how!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you better figure it out! I need my men  wide-eyed and hungry, Krabs! We've got a cargo-hold full of suntan lotion! And...",not spongebob,0
"Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion?  What SPF?",not spongebob,0
"I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  Chafed, Mr. Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Chafed!,spongebob,1
Chafed!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!",not spongebob,0
"So, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible! You understand, me?!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, sir!",not spongebob,0
The worst you've ever made!,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!",not spongebob,0
The kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines!,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!",not spongebob,0
Either that or I'll throw you in the brig!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
Huzzah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't huzzah yet, boys.",not spongebob,0
"What's on the menu tonight, eh?",not spongebob,0
Slop.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, slop, eh? Good one! Why don't you put some of that delicious slop right here on my...  Oh. I bet it's one of those things that looks bad, but it tastes really...  Bad.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry boys.  Captain's orders.  Oh, I can't stand it!  I don't care what the captain says!",not spongebob,0
Huzzah! Huzzah for Mr. Krabs! Huzzah!,not spongebob,0
What's all this huzzahing about?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys?",not spongebob,0
Attention!  Looks like slop alright. But what's this?,not spongebob,0
Cherries jubilee.,not spongebob,0
Cherries jubilee!,not spongebob,0
Cherries jubilee?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, flaming cherries jubilee.",not spongebob,0
"Flaming?! What are you trying to pull, you lubber? This looks like regular cherries jubilee!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and...  And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move.  The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare!",not spongebob,0
"Grr, what are you looking at?",not spongebob,0
But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball.",spongebob,1
"I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say.  I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention.  He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?",not spongebob,0
"Sick in bed like all the men. The captain's been feeding them nothing but moldy, old sandwich crusts.  They've all got terrible bellyaches. But not me, though. I cook for myself.",not spongebob,0
"Wise lad.  And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off.  And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom.  But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me.  Pirates! We were under attack!  I had to act fast!  Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations!  I was on me own.  I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates!  And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn!  The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!",not spongebob,0
"Row, you worthless dogs!",not spongebob,0
"Stand down, Krabs! I'll have you on irons!",not spongebob,0
"Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!",not spongebob,0
"We're not outfitted for battle, Krabs! There's no ammunition! The cannons are ornamental at best!  Ornamental at best!",not spongebob,0
Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!,not spongebob,0
What you're suggesting is mutiny!,not spongebob,0
"Do as he says, captain!",not spongebob,0
"What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I rolled up an old, moldy sandwich crust into a hard, little ball.",not spongebob,0
"That's it!  Come with me, lad!  Direct hit!",not spongebob,0
Huzzah!,not spongebob,0
You'll pay for that! Get 'em boys!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, what do I do?",not spongebob,0
Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain!  Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo!  Close one! Ha-ha!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, he's kinda handsome for a crusty old cuss.",not spongebob,0
I can't do it. I'm weak.,not spongebob,0
"Snap out of it, man!  Eeww!",not spongebob,0
My personality!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, let me put that back.",not spongebob,0
"Oh my! This feels wonderful! Yes, it feels great!",not spongebob,0
"Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me!  Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?",not spongebob,0
Finish him off!,not spongebob,0
Huzzah for Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade!  Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!,not spongebob,0
"Handsome and clever, I see.  Join me, Krabs! We'll rule the seven seas together!",not spongebob,0
"I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar!",not spongebob,0
Huh?  Oh!,not spongebob,0
What are we all winking about?,not spongebob,0
I don't know!,spongebob,1
"What the...?  SpongeBob, do you mind!?",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?",spongebob,1
What am I doing!? What are you doing!?,not spongebob,0
"I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?",spongebob,1
Cala-what?,not spongebob,0
"Walking to work, huh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Go away.,not spongebob,0
Can I walk with you?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Please?,spongebob,1
No.  I said NO! I will not walk to work with yo--!,not spongebob,0
"Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!",spongebob,1
I'll have two Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
Okay. And would you like cheese on--,not spongebob,0
Do you...need a break or something?,not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear.  SpongeBob!  It's empty!  See empty!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Squidward, how do you know that?",spongebob,1
"Well, let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain.",not spongebob,0
"Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.",spongebob,1
"Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is...",not spongebob,0
"I gotta do something.  Okay, Squidward, this should help.  Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you.  I can fix this.  This time, I got ya.",spongebob,1
Me soda machine!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward?",spongebob,1
You really sent him over the edge this time.,not spongebob,0
"Technically, I drove him up the wall.",spongebob,1
One shift later...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.",not spongebob,0
Present? A present? For me?,spongebob,1
"Now, now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Squidward! My very own... restraining order. Uh...what is that?",spongebob,1
Perhaps my lawyers should explain.,not spongebob,0
"We are the law offices of Harry, Combover, and Bald! Specializing in restraining order logical law and here to tell one Mr. SquarePants...",not spongebob,0
You've been served!,not spongebob,0
"Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys-",spongebob,1
"Per paragraph 3 of the restraining order, you may no longer speak to our client.  Likewise, you may not come within 15 feet of Mr. Squidward at any time. Any infractions of these statues will result in serious jail time!",not spongebob,0
Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during serious jail time?,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
And.,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
No! I don't wanna go!,spongebob,1
"Well, then, follow the guidelines we've explain and you won't have to.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to, or get within fifteen feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?",spongebob,1
That's not our problem.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm... There we go! Three Krabby Patties, two large Kelpy Colas, and three fries ready to be served.  Hmm?  Oops!  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order.",spongebob,1
"Let me see that!  Thank you! Look, boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart!",not spongebob,0
"Think, SpongeBob, think! Gasp! I got it!",spongebob,1
Hehe.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.",not spongebob,0
Hehe.,not spongebob,0
I thought not  Oh-kay Patrick. What? What? What!,not spongebob,0
Notice anything...  Different? Huh? Huh? A hint!,not spongebob,0
Patrick! I am not not paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Patrick! Get back to...what? Work? Oh no! No! No! No! Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Why all the shivering of the timbers, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!,not spongebob,0
"It'll stand. Oh, unless you'd rather talk with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Can I watch you work?,not spongebob,0

"What's the matter, is he stupid?",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.",spongebob,1
"Well, we can't just leave him out here.",not spongebob,0

"Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.",spongebob,1
"I know, good thing there's two of us.",not spongebob,0
"You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.",spongebob,1
"Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own. Oh, I wanna be the mom!",not spongebob,0
"I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.",spongebob,1

Nuh-uh.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile.",spongebob,1
"How do I look?  Wow, I look great.",not spongebob,0
The Mitten!,not spongebob,0
"I mean, The Mitten.",spongebob,1
That ride's for babies.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is.,spongebob,1
I guess that ride was too much for the little guy.,not spongebob,0
"Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, why, why, why?  Why won't you let me on the ride?",not spongebob,0
"Sir, you have a serious medical condition.",not spongebob,0
But it's my birthday!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
One more time!,not spongebob,0
"You know, this is the line for the bathroom.",not spongebob,0
We've gone eight times.,spongebob,1
And I went three times all by myself.,not spongebob,0
I'm going to walk away now.,not spongebob,0
Bye.,spongebob,1
Have fun!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Patrick!,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Larry.",spongebob,1
"I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush.  You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?",not spongebob,0
"Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry!",spongebob,1
"Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?",not spongebob,0
"I'm hungry, too.",not spongebob,0
Maybe I should stop making people smell me.,not spongebob,0
Want some?,not spongebob,0
"No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back.",not spongebob,0
Hurry back so we can go on the ride.,spongebob,1
"What's the matter, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.",spongebob,1
Patrick's your best friend. You can't let him down.,not spongebob,0
"I know, but the ride is really scary.",spongebob,1
You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary!,not spongebob,0
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!",spongebob,1
"You like that? You like that? Huh, you like that?",not spongebob,0
It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.,not spongebob,0
No you can't. You're a big crybaby.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah?  I thought we'd settled this the last time!",not spongebob,0
"Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.",not spongebob,0
"I have to tell you something too, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Attention. Glove World! will be closing in five minutes.,not spongebob,0
Five minutes?!,not spongebob,0
What are you looking at?,not spongebob,0
"Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...",spongebob,1
...and explosive diarrhea.,not spongebob,0
Is that all?,spongebob,1
"Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.",not spongebob,0
Last call for the Fiery Fist O' Pain.,not spongebob,0
"Well, this is it, Pat.",spongebob,1
Yep.,not spongebob,0
Here we go.,spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.,spongebob,1
After you.,not spongebob,0
We made it.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.  There.,not spongebob,0
"Now if you could just sign this release, involving Glove World! in case of accidental spine loss...  Well, nice knowing you.",not spongebob,0
Ready in ten...,not spongebob,0
"This is it, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Nine, eight...",not spongebob,0
We made it!,spongebob,1
"Seven, six...",not spongebob,0
We're not scaredy cats.,not spongebob,0
"Five, four...",not spongebob,0
We're not crybabies.,spongebob,1
"Three, two...",not spongebob,0
We're brave!,not spongebob,0
One...,not spongebob,0
"Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.",not spongebob,0
"Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry, guys. Maybe next time.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.",spongebob,1
Me too.,not spongebob,0
"I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.",spongebob,1
I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.,not spongebob,0
But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait, it's fine.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Have fun.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Goodbye, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Goodbye, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying!,not spongebob,0
It's over. You can get out now.,not spongebob,0
We did it!,not spongebob,0
We conquered our fears!,spongebob,1
We stopped crying!,not spongebob,0
We survived the Fist o' Pain!,spongebob,1
"Hey, hold it right there! You forgot these.",not spongebob,0
Our spines!  Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Let's go again!,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
"Good day, sir. I am...",not spongebob,0
I know exactly who you are!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare.",spongebob,1
"Jason, I have to be honest. There's someone else.",not spongebob,0
Grandpa!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing?",spongebob,1
I have to get rid of these books!,not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
I'll show you why.  See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books.  Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...,not spongebob,0
Small portion meals?,spongebob,1
Exactly!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man.  Hi there.",spongebob,1
"Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?",not spongebob,0
"Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this alleged starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books.",spongebob,1
"Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, what is it?  This is the worst-tasting gift ever!",not spongebob,0
"That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something.  Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, that's great!",spongebob,1
What is?,not spongebob,0
That you're king!,spongebob,1
What's a king?,not spongebob,0
"When you're a king, you can get anything you want.",spongebob,1
"Anything I want?  SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?",not spongebob,0
"Your wish is my command, your majesty.  Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king.",spongebob,1
King needs food badly.,not spongebob,0
"What's this all ab...  Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
The king would like...,spongebob,1
"Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.",not spongebob,0
"I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...",not spongebob,0
I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king.,not spongebob,0
Tasty.,not spongebob,0
"Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?",not spongebob,0
"How about you pay the check, instead?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.",spongebob,1
"All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king!",not spongebob,0
Are you gonna eat that?,not spongebob,0
"I was planning to, why?",not spongebob,0
I want it.,not spongebob,0
Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?,not spongebob,0
"Tell him, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.",spongebob,1
I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?,not spongebob,0
"Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.",spongebob,1
Good! Now tell him.,not spongebob,0
"Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants.",spongebob,1
This isn't fair.,not spongebob,0
"Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.",not spongebob,0
"I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me.",not spongebob,0
"No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!",not spongebob,0
"But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!",not spongebob,0
I will cry about it.  I'll cry right to my mom!,not spongebob,0
I love being king.,not spongebob,0
"Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.",spongebob,1
I hope so. Neptune knows I did.  Oof!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sire?",spongebob,1
I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect.",not spongebob,0
"Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect.",not spongebob,0
"My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick. What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.",not spongebob,0
Your front yard?,not spongebob,0
"Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.",spongebob,1
Ferris Wheel?!,not spongebob,0
"I know, isn't it great?",spongebob,1
"No, it's not great! It's horrible! Oh, that's it! Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?",not spongebob,0
Uh...,not spongebob,0
"You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe.",not spongebob,0
He might be on to something.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Why are we giving this guy all our stuff?,not spongebob,0
"See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!",not spongebob,0
"Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, right away, your majesty.  Umm, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty!",not spongebob,0
"My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what's happened to you?",spongebob,1
I don't know what you mean.,not spongebob,0
"Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...",spongebob,1
And what...,not spongebob,0
"And, um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.",spongebob,1
Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.,not spongebob,0
"Uh...well, I...",spongebob,1
"Who's saying I'm abusing my power!?  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is reason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself!",not spongebob,0
Knock knock.,not spongebob,0
Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?,not spongebob,0
You.,not spongebob,0
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
I'm you and you are me.,not spongebob,0
What have I become?!,not spongebob,0
"Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility.  You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?",not spongebob,0
No. Uh-uh.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown.",not spongebob,0
"Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!",not spongebob,0
"Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hold on there, SpongeBob!  Take that pile of filth out with you.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!",spongebob,1
"He means this filth, you loon!",not spongebob,0
"Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.",spongebob,1
"Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! Up with bubbles, down with air!  Nematodes are people too!  Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a .",spongebob,1
Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?,not spongebob,0
"Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.",spongebob,1
"Hi, garbage man.  Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?",spongebob,1
"Krabs... Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?",not spongebob,0
"Nah-uh, not that word, that word.",spongebob,1
"Hmm... ! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.",not spongebob,0
Sentence enhancers?,spongebob,1
"You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?",spongebob,1
"Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!",not spongebob,0
"How  right you are, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.",spongebob,1
"Oh, mine, too!",not spongebob,0
It tingles when I laugh!,spongebob,1
"Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh?",spongebob,1
Did he just say?!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, he did.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?",spongebob,1
"Pretty  good, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.",not spongebob,0
"Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.  And don't forget to ask us to  the  fries. It will be our  pleasure.  Hi, Squidward, how the  are ya?",spongebob,1
"Nice  day, isn't it, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.",not spongebob,0
Let's go somewhere more family oriented.,not spongebob,0
I'm never eating here again.,not spongebob,0
Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.,not spongebob,0
"Huh?  The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?",not spongebob,0
"Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what was it? What'd he say?",not spongebob,0
"Er...he said...um, well he said...",not spongebob,0
"Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's fancy talk.",not spongebob,0
There ain't nothing fancy about that word!,not spongebob,0
You mean ?,spongebob,1
"Yes, that one!  Now quit saying that!  It's a bad word!",not spongebob,0
Bad word?!,not spongebob,0
"Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.",not spongebob,0
Don't you mean there are only 7?,not spongebob,0
Not if you're a sailor.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, 13.",spongebob,1
That's a lot of  bad words.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.",not spongebob,0
We promise.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, my favorite!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes!",spongebob,1
"Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.",not spongebob,0
Darn.,spongebob,1
"My turn!  Hooray! Escalators! Yay!  Up, up, up!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators!   Eels again.",spongebob,1
My turn!  Escalators!,not spongebob,0
"Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!  Eels?",spongebob,1
"Es-skee-lators!  Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!",not spongebob,0
"Escalators, escalators, escalators!  Ha! Escalators!",spongebob,1
Eels...,not spongebob,0
"Ah, !",spongebob,1
Ooooh...! You said number 11!,not spongebob,0
"I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand.  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, Patrick!  Patrick, no, please don't tell!",spongebob,1
"But, you said !",not spongebob,0
Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!,spongebob,1
Not if I tell first!,not spongebob,0
I can run faster than you!,spongebob,1
"See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha!  Oh, nooooo!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"What, what, what?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Yes, yes, yes?",not spongebob,0
"He said, he said, he said!",spongebob,1
"Out with it, boy!",not spongebob,0
"Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.",spongebob,1
What kind of things?,not spongebob,0
"Well, he said...",spongebob,1
Yes?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.",spongebob,1
"Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!,not spongebob,0
...number thirteen...,spongebob,1
Mmm-mmm...!,not spongebob,0
"Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?",not spongebob,0
Mmm-hmm...  He said !,not spongebob,0
"Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash.  You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back.",not spongebob,0
What's going to happen to us?,not spongebob,0
We'll probably get 40 lashes!,spongebob,1
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Agreed!,not spongebob,0
"All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What  genius put a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh!",not spongebob,0
"Five, six, seven...",spongebob,1
"...a whole lotta  and with a side of , a heapin' helpin' of  and a boatload of  ...",not spongebob,0
Nine...,not spongebob,0
Ooh crabbin’  Ooh-hoo-uh!,not spongebob,0
"That's all thirteen, Patrick!  We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!",not spongebob,0
"Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Why, hello there!",not spongebob,0
"Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice !",spongebob,1
It was terrible.,not spongebob,0
"And he-- --Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!",spongebob,1
"Oh, dear! My poor old heart.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you?  You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!",not spongebob,0
"You should all be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors.",not spongebob,0
I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade.  Yeeeoww! My  foot!,not spongebob,0
Mother!,not spongebob,0
What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.,not spongebob,0
"Howdy, Mrs. K!",not spongebob,0
"You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm?  Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!",not spongebob,0
You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Yes.  Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick!,not spongebob,0
One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.,not spongebob,0
Nagging Neptune!  Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!,not spongebob,0
Sweet gashes molasses!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, pee-yew! What's that awful stench? You're not boiling your underpants again, are you?",not spongebob,0
"I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce.  But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus.",not spongebob,0
"Idiot sauce!  I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?",not spongebob,0
I think I'd prefer the boiling underpants.  Let me do it. You always make a mess.,not spongebob,0
"Leave me be, woman!",not spongebob,0
Don't tell me...,not spongebob,0
Oh no.,not spongebob,0
I've got the best taste in town! Duh!,not spongebob,0
I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.,not spongebob,0
"What happened to your head, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, me make Krabby Patties.",spongebob,1
"Uh, that's mud.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?",not spongebob,0
I don't understand the question.,not spongebob,0
What in Sam Hill?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, don't do that!",not spongebob,0
"Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero.",not spongebob,0
Zero as being everyone's collective IQ.,not spongebob,0
And that's how the idiot sauce spread throughout Bikini Bottom. I guess you weren't affected because you were protected by your treedome.,not spongebob,0
And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.,not spongebob,0
You not Plankton! Me Plankton!,not spongebob,0
We need to snap him out of this. What's the opposite of dim?,not spongebob,0
Bright.,not spongebob,0
It's not working! Maybe we can feed him something for brain food. You're smart. What do you eat?,not spongebob,0
Nuts?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change?",not spongebob,0
"I usually just yell at him. Get smart, dummy!",not spongebob,0
Wise up!,not spongebob,0
"Be clever, idiot!",not spongebob,0
Know things!,not spongebob,0
It's no use. Being smart takes work.,not spongebob,0
That gives me an idea.,not spongebob,0
"Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up, all you morons! Classes are now beginning!",not spongebob,0
Aww! This isn't working!,not spongebob,0
Try jiggling the keys!,not spongebob,0
"Good mornin', students.",not spongebob,0
A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.,not spongebob,0
One semester later...,not spongebob,0
And don't forget your last homework assignment!,not spongebob,0
Looks like we were able to educate the whole town in one semester!,not spongebob,0
Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well.,not spongebob,0
Everybody but one.,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Skool iz dum? You misspelled every word.,not spongebob,0
"Shut up, dweeb!",not spongebob,0
"Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!",not spongebob,0
"I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!",not spongebob,0
"Um, Plankton, can I come out now?",spongebob,1
"Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn.",spongebob,1
I'll never learn!,not spongebob,0
Not again!,not spongebob,0
Ahh. Graduation Day.,not spongebob,0
"This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet.",not spongebob,0
"Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas.",spongebob,1
Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula!  Yes! That's it!,not spongebob,0
"Great! Well, see ya out there.",spongebob,1
Somethin' smells good!,not spongebob,0
Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?,not spongebob,0
"It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon.  Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!",not spongebob,0
"No, please! Not that! Anything but that!",not spongebob,0
"Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, SpongeBob! You're smart now! It's funny that Mr. Krabs never showed up to get his diploma.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.  Let me have that diploma!,spongebob,1
"Uh, hey. No running in the halls!",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, your diploma!",spongebob,1
"Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!",not spongebob,0
"Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!",not spongebob,0
But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!,not spongebob,0
"Excellent, Mr. Krabs!  Here's your final grade for acting class. A+.  I've really felt the fear.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, what?! Acting class?!  No!",not spongebob,0
"You've finally been schooled, drop-out!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, evil genius. Time to start your post-college years.",not spongebob,0
"Get up, Patrick! It's time!",spongebob,1
Time for what?,not spongebob,0
The big shin-dig! Remember?,spongebob,1
"No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today.",not spongebob,0
"That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship.",spongebob,1
"The beach! Just you and me!?  So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine!  I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend.,spongebob,1
You're hurting me!,not spongebob,0
Guess what?,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
I'm going to the beach with my best friend!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?",spongebob,1
I don't care.,not spongebob,0
"You know what this situation calls for. Patrick!  A few verses of the best friend tune! ♪Ohhhh best fr-♪  Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are.",spongebob,1
I knew it! We've been abandoned!,not spongebob,0
No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here!,spongebob,1
"A little help, bro?",not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!",spongebob,1
Small plastic disc that you throw!  I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!,not spongebob,0
"I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.",spongebob,1
Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?,not spongebob,0
"Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll  toss it to you!",spongebob,1
Ha ha ha ha.,not spongebob,0
Ready?!,spongebob,1
Ha ha ha! That's why they call it a sandwich!,not spongebob,0
"I caught it!  Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I can assure you, that was not cool! Just look at what you've done! Your buffoonery has destroyed the lifeguard tower! Why don't you find something to do that's less obnoxious?",not spongebob,0
Like what?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, go play in the sand or something!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.",not spongebob,0
"Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...",spongebob,1
"Boring, SpongeBob, boring!",not spongebob,0
"I know, we can make sand castles!",spongebob,1
That sounds  un-boring!,not spongebob,0
"No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?",spongebob,1
Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over.",spongebob,1
Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!,not spongebob,0
"I'm just trying to help, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't need any help.",not spongebob,0
Here are those architectural plans you requested.,not spongebob,0
Why thank you. Here's a little something for you.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.",spongebob,1
"Now, we're even!",not spongebob,0
"All right, Patrick, have it your way.  You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine.",spongebob,1
"Now, this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle!",not spongebob,0
"I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh, sir, you built onto my side.",spongebob,1
So?,not spongebob,0
"So, you don't do that!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.",spongebob,1
You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for!,not spongebob,0
But what for what!?,spongebob,1
"Now, we're even... again!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?",spongebob,1
This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, is that so!? Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on!  Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off.",spongebob,1
No way! You started it.,not spongebob,0
Fine! Have it your way.,spongebob,1
Whatever.  No no no no no.  Oh hello! And goodbye.,not spongebob,0
Come on!  How do you like them apples?,spongebob,1
You'll never win! Do you hear me!?,not spongebob,0
"Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?",spongebob,1
I like you this much!  Feel me!,not spongebob,0
Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?,spongebob,1
The question is... will you be!?  No fair!,not spongebob,0
"All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun!",spongebob,1
"What was that!? Come on, we got to get out of here!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? Two can play at this game!",not spongebob,0
Jumping jellyfish! WHOA!,spongebob,1
"I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice.",not spongebob,0
"Let's beat it, dude!",not spongebob,0
Ohhhh.,spongebob,1
Ohhhh. What happened?,not spongebob,0
"I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away.",spongebob,1
"Me, too...was it worth it?",not spongebob,0
"No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson.",spongebob,1
Let's also not forget who's going to clean this place up.,not spongebob,0
"Oooh, uhhhh, ahhhh...",not spongebob,0
Better get started! You've got a lot of work to do.,not spongebob,0
I bet I can clean up faster than you!,not spongebob,0
Oh yeah? I bet you can't!,spongebob,1
"Yes, I can!",not spongebob,0
"No, I can!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I can!",not spongebob,0
I can!,spongebob,1
"Hey, look at this!",not spongebob,0
Watch this.,not spongebob,0
Mmm-hey!,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Hiyah, hiyah! Hiyah!",not spongebob,0
"Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's only, um...  June o'clock.",not spongebob,0
"It ain't autumn!   Oh, my tree is dying!",not spongebob,0
"Good, we can use the wood.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, stop! I can save it with science.",not spongebob,0
Okay. Hmm.,not spongebob,0
Feed me!,not spongebob,0
Jumpin' beans on a trampoline! You're starvin'! I got to make you the best fertilizer known to critter-kind!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, growth pills.  Hi!  Nuts.  Ah-ha!  Yee-haw!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, I hope this is the pick-me-up you needed ole' girl.  Well, kiss my grits! This here's the biggest acorn I ever did see!  And so are those! I'd better start storing these for winter.  I might need an alternate storage solution.",not spongebob,0
"Hey there, SpongeBob? Could you swing by my place?",not spongebob,0
"I love squirreling away nuts, but this is just too much!",not spongebob,0
I'd say you've certainly got a real nutmare on your hands.,spongebob,1
Just dump these somewhere! I'm gonna put more under my bed.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, ma'am!",spongebob,1
Stop!,not spongebob,0
Whoa. Who are you?,spongebob,1
I am the spirit guide of the salmon people! I am the Shalmon!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
"Why do you dump your nuts on my people's land, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's.",spongebob,1
Allow me to give you some sage advice. You must not squander nature's bounty. Nuts are meant to be eatin'.  It's all in my book.,not spongebob,0
Meant to be eatin' eh?,spongebob,1
"Of course! The earth provides our food and we must care for her in return.  It's all about balance, my friend. Look at my garden.",not spongebob,0
Wow. It's coming in great.,spongebob,1
Over there!,not spongebob,0
Even better!,spongebob,1
So some Shalmon guy told you people would want to eat my nuts and you believe it?,not spongebob,0
Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham.,spongebob,1
Shertainly not! I mean certainly not!  Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make.,not spongebob,0
Woo-hoo! That's delicious!,not spongebob,0
Wow! Patrick would wanna try this.,spongebob,1
Try what?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that Nutty Butter is for eating.",not spongebob,0
I know.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?,not spongebob,0
Thanks!,not spongebob,0
Can I have some more?  It's hard to eat off this side of me.,not spongebob,0
"Sure, Patrick! Here's the last of it!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Sandy!",not spongebob,0
There. Everything is back to normal.  What in tarnation?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what's going on here?",not spongebob,0
I want more Nutty Butter.,not spongebob,0
Who are all these people?,not spongebob,0
Oh.  They licked the Nutty Butter off my back.  And now they're here for more.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, gosh Patrick. I don't have enough to feed everyone.",not spongebob,0
But it's the only thing my boy will eat!,not spongebob,0
Guess I'll have to go to bed hungry again.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't want to let anyone down. I can make some more acorns!",not spongebob,0
Making everyone's day with my Nutty Butter really gives me the warm and tinglies!,not spongebob,0
Uh huh.,not spongebob,0
"In fact, demands have been so high, I scienced up a way to increase my production.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt.  Then the tubes take them inside  where I turn them into Nutty Butter.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able.",spongebob,1
"Don't worry about my tree, SpongeBob. Worry about the crowd of Nutty Butter fans outside.",not spongebob,0
We want Nutty Butter! We want Nutty Butter!,not spongebob,0
We're gonna need a lot more acorns to feed them all.,not spongebob,0
"Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, Something, something, something, science. And who are we to argue with science?",not spongebob,0
Oh no! The nuts stopped!,spongebob,1
Hold on! I got this!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!",spongebob,1
And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!,not spongebob,0
"Please, please no pushing! I'll make more! Remember, Sandy's the squirrel you can count on!",not spongebob,0
Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?,not spongebob,0
The tree got real sick!,spongebob,1
Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts.,not spongebob,0
You used all the nuts? Jumpin' Jiminy! Time for another dose of fertilizer!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!",spongebob,1
The boy is right! Why do you hurt your tree? The tree would never hurt you.  Ouch! Dang splinters!,not spongebob,0
Shalmon?,spongebob,1
"Wait, you're the one who said I should feed my nuts to the people?",not spongebob,0
"Indeed. But to feed so many from a single tree... Let me share with you a story. Long ago, before fish walked the seas, there lived in the sky one sun.",not spongebob,0
One star.,not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
And one moon.,not spongebob,0
What the?,not spongebob,0
"During the day, the star would play with the sun.",not spongebob,0
"At night, the star would play with the moon.",not spongebob,0
Get away from me!,not spongebob,0
The star did not want to let his friends down. But he alone could not keep up with both the sun and the moon.,not spongebob,0
Finally. Some peace.,not spongebob,0
That is when the star had an idea.,not spongebob,0
Hmm? Hmm? Ahh!  Oh no. There goes the neighborhood.,not spongebob,0
"By creating many copies, the star was able to keep the sun and moon happy without wearing himself out. Do you understand why I tell you this tale?",not spongebob,0
Hello? Wake up!,not spongebob,0
I didn't know there was gonna be a test!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends.",not spongebob,0
"Perhaps with many trees, you can continue serving your community in a natural and sustainable manner.  I mean pretty much anything is better than this mess! Yeesh!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Shammy. But I'm a one tree kind of squirrel. I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place. Order the ole' girl some nutritious new dirt from Texas!",not spongebob,0
"Well, my work here is done. It's time I return to my people.",not spongebob,0
"Let me offer some sage advice. You must listen to the earth and the stars, for only they can guide you!... To my stop at the corner of Olive and Victory.",not spongebob,0
"Sir, stand behind the white line please.",not spongebob,0
Typical. It never ends!,not spongebob,0
Laser wrench.,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm.,spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Ah.,spongebob,1
Uh-uh.,not spongebob,0
Mm?,spongebob,1
Not even close.,not spongebob,0
No. No. No.,not spongebob,0
Oh!,spongebob,1
"Ugh, fine! It'll do.",not spongebob,0
Hm?,not spongebob,0
I'll get it!,spongebob,1
"Surprise!  Hi-ya, sis!",not spongebob,0
Howdy!,not spongebob,0
Auntie!,not spongebob,0
Sandy!,not spongebob,0
Oh! I didn't expect y'all till tomorrow.,not spongebob,0
"I know how much you love your nieces y'know, so I brought 'em a day early.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, this here's my sister, Rosy and my three nieces.  This'n here's Macadamia.",not spongebob,0
How do?,not spongebob,0
Hazelnut.,not spongebob,0
How do?,not spongebob,0
And little Pistachio.,not spongebob,0
How d—,not spongebob,0
"Girls, this is my friend, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Aww, what sweet little angels!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, angels. Okay, well I gotta skedaddle.  Freedom!",not spongebob,0
Doggone it. They're too early! I'm not finished with their present!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals until you're done!",spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob, but there's something I gotta tell you about babysitting my—",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy.",spongebob,1
Excuse me.,spongebob,1
Y'all mind your Uncle SpongeBob now.,not spongebob,0
"Story time!  Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering.",spongebob,1
Don't waste your breath...,not spongebob,0
And don't make a hassle...,not spongebob,0
Some kids like to read...,not spongebob,0
But we'd rather wrassle!,not spongebob,0
Wrassle match!,not spongebob,0
"Now you girls go easy on me, okay?",spongebob,1
One!,not spongebob,0
Two!,not spongebob,0
Ow!,spongebob,1
Ugh.  Why don't ya show the girls around town?,not spongebob,0
Great idea!  I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!,spongebob,1
"The Krusty Krab!  Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces.",spongebob,1
"Oh, nieces, eh? And what brings such cute little customers to Bikini Bottom?",not spongebob,0
We're visiting Auntie Sandy…,not spongebob,0
And we want to sling hash...,not spongebob,0
A chophouse like this must be...,not spongebob,0
Loaded with cash!,not spongebob,0
"Aww! Go on! No, really. Go on.",not spongebob,0
"This is my coworker-slash-best buddy, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Ugh! Children.,not spongebob,0
Ugh! Grown-ups.,not spongebob,0
This feller ain't happy.,not spongebob,0
Just look at his face.,not spongebob,0
We're gonna be sick all over the place!,not spongebob,0
Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.,spongebob,1
Can you stop playing dress-up long enough to make some Krabby Patties?,not spongebob,0
Huh! Guess that's me all over.,spongebob,1
You two look ridiculerous!,not spongebob,0
Ha! You're your own worst enemy.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, from now on, babysit off Krusty Krab Property!  And Mr. Squidward, dress like SpongeBob on your own time.",not spongebob,0
That place really stunk.,not spongebob,0
It was lamer than lame.,not spongebob,0
Take us somewhere fun.,not spongebob,0
Or taste Texas pain!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot.",spongebob,1
"Ahh, smell that fresh seawater.",spongebob,1
"Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry.",spongebob,1
"See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Uncle SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0

Our sandy surprise!,not spongebob,0
It's our gift to you!,not spongebob,0
"Well, isn't that sweet!",spongebob,1
And it won't wash away...!,not spongebob,0
'Cause it's made of concrete!,not spongebob,0
"Concrete, what?!  Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!",spongebob,1
"So, sorry, Uncle.",not spongebob,0
We made it too small...,not spongebob,0
But we'll get you out...,not spongebob,0
With this wrecking ball!,not spongebob,0
Wrecking what?!,spongebob,1
Let's all go to my house and take a little break.,spongebob,1
"Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine—  Whoa!",spongebob,1
I've been waiting all day to watch your TV!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out.",spongebob,1
"I forgot how to make it work!  Show me! Show me funny! I wanna see stories! Go, go!  Please!",not spongebob,0
Boop. There you go.,spongebob,1

From a rattlesnake's tail...,not spongebob,0
To an armadillo's chest...,not spongebob,0
Our Auntie Sandy...,not spongebob,0
Is the gol'durn best!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Sandy.  I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter.",spongebob,1
I tried to tell ya the first rule of babysitting my nieces.,not spongebob,0
What's that?,spongebob,1
Don't babysit my nieces!,not spongebob,0
"Bye, Auntie Sandy! Bye, Uncle SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Bye-bye! Have a nice trip back to Texas!  Bless their evil little hearts.,not spongebob,0
"Ahhh...  Oh, no.",not spongebob,0
"Hiya, Ma! Did ya miss us?",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, another peaceful evening in Bikini Bottom. Listen to the tropical tranquility.  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
"Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!",spongebob,1
That's horrible!,not spongebob,0
It was an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!!,spongebob,1
He ate my wheelbarrow!,not spongebob,0
He ate my children's homework!,not spongebob,0
...Do I need to say it?,not spongebob,0
How can we protect ourselves?,not spongebob,0
I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
We should lock our doors!,not spongebob,0
We should call my nephew!,not spongebob,0
We should dig a moat!,not spongebob,0
"We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else!",not spongebob,0
That idea may just be crazy enough... TO GET US ALL KILLED!,not spongebob,0
What's wrong with my idea?,not spongebob,0
Let's get someone to go after it!,not spongebob,0
There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm!,not spongebob,0
You got a bathroom in this place?,not spongebob,0
In the back.,not spongebob,0
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
"I'll catch your worm for ya, that is if'n you're willin' ta pay.",not spongebob,0
NOOOO! YOU'LL NEVER GET A CENT OUT OF ME!  NEVER! I'D RATHER THAT WORM COME IN HERE RIGHT NOW AND EAT YOU ALL ALIVE!!!  ...Sorry.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all.  Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone!  Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward!  I am gonna get back what's mine!",not spongebob,0
"What!?! But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against! We're talking about an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!!",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here.  Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms.  Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw!",not spongebob,0
"But, Sandy, you don't know!",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long.",not spongebob,0
Sandy! Sandy!,spongebob,1

Wait! Sandy!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, you coming to watch?",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, don't go!",spongebob,1
Why not?,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I saw it! It's BIG, SCARY AND PINK!",spongebob,1
"So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that, neither.",not spongebob,0
You'll get massacred!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different bigs. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?",spongebob,1
"If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?",not spongebob,0
"Um, I do?",spongebob,1
You do? Where?,not spongebob,0
Um... in my pocket.,spongebob,1
"Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on!  SpongeBob, that's a paper clip... and a piece of string.",not spongebob,0
"No, it's not, this is your tail.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"HOW WOULD YOU KNOW!? IT'S ALWAYS BEHIND YOU! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for... and there ain't nothin' you can say to stop me!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen fedibble no-hip'?",spongebob,1
"Well, I gotta admit, that's slowing me down, but I'm still going for him!",not spongebob,0
"You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!",spongebob,1
You ain't my pa!,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!",spongebob,1
Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!,not spongebob,0
"No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom?",not spongebob,0
You are.,spongebob,1
"And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, K in karate?",not spongebob,0
You did.,spongebob,1
And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?,not spongebob,0
You do.,spongebob,1
"Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,spongebob,1
Say it.,not spongebob,0
There isn't anything...,spongebob,1
Ain't nothin'!,not spongebob,0
Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but...,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
You see...,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
I...,spongebob,1
Worm sign.  He's in that cave.,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, are you sure you...?",spongebob,1
"Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew.  Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah!  I'm winnin', SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, that's not...!",spongebob,1
This shouldn't take long.,not spongebob,0
"Sandy, that's not...!",spongebob,1
Almost done!,not spongebob,0
Sandy!,spongebob,1
"Yee-haw!  I got him, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Sandy...?,spongebob,1
"Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail!",not spongebob,0
That's not the worm.,spongebob,1
Pardon?,not spongebob,0
That's not the worm. That's his tongue!,spongebob,1
"...Ohhhh, this is the tongue. And the whole thing is the... worm.  RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!",not spongebob,0
"So what's the plan, Sandy?",spongebob,1
Run faster!,not spongebob,0
"I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!",spongebob,1
Later!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?",spongebob,1
"Not now, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I wanna hear you say it!,spongebob,1
Can we talk about this another time?,not spongebob,0
Say it!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Say it, or I'll trip you!",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Say it!,spongebob,1
Not now!,not spongebob,0
Say it!,spongebob,1
"Okay! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?",not spongebob,0
I knew it.,spongebob,1
Not again!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Sandy?",spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
What do we do now?,spongebob,1
"I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?",not spongebob,0
"I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for SpongeBob or S for Sandy! That way they can identify our bodies!",spongebob,1
"No, silly! How about S for save our skins?  Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here!  We did it!",not spongebob,0
Yay! He'll never get out of there!,spongebob,1
We saved the town!,not spongebob,0
Yay! Let's go tell everybody!,spongebob,1
PUSH!!!!  PUSH!!!!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Ouuuuuch...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!",spongebob,1
"Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?",not spongebob,0
What is it?,spongebob,1
"It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what are you gonna do with it?",spongebob,1
"I'm goin' to the moon, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
The moon! Can I go?,spongebob,1
"No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you.",not spongebob,0
"But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.",spongebob,1
I need that drawer.,not spongebob,0
"Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways.",not spongebob,0
"Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!",spongebob,1
"That's the air vent, SpongeBob.  I need that, too.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?",spongebob,1
All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...,not spongebob,0
"YEAH!!! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!",spongebob,1
"But this time, just don't touch anything, okay?",not spongebob,0
"Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?",spongebob,1
"Aww, hush, silly.  This is for harvesting moon rocks.",not spongebob,0
"Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.",spongebob,1
"Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick.",spongebob,1
"Hi ya, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?",spongebob,1
"Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.",not spongebob,0
A present?,spongebob,1
"No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?",not spongebob,0
"There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!",not spongebob,0
"Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!",spongebob,1
"Look how big it is, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"It's pretty impressive, all right.",spongebob,1
Come on!,not spongebob,0
"We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!",spongebob,1
Wow. How do you think we get inside?,not spongebob,0
"We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows.",spongebob,1
"I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, just don't touch anything.",spongebob,1
"Look, I'm winning!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?",spongebob,1
WOO-HOO! WINNER! YEAH! HIGH SCORE!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?",spongebob,1
I don't know!  But let's see what this does!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I don't think we should...",spongebob,1
I like rockets.,not spongebob,0
More! More!,not spongebob,0
"No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I think this one starts it!",not spongebob,0
"Stop, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here. And I happen to know that that particular button is riiight over here.",spongebob,1
You started the rocket!,not spongebob,0
"...Awwwww, Spongebob...",not spongebob,0
"Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!",not spongebob,0
Look!  We're in space now! Wee!,spongebob,1
"Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!",spongebob,1
"Hey, who turned the heavy back on?",not spongebob,0
We must be landing.,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.",spongebob,1
So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we’ve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought?! I think?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!",spongebob,1
"You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!",spongebob,1
Alien hunting! Alien hunting!,not spongebob,0
"Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them. Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis.",spongebob,1
Wait! What's THAT?  I think I'm gonna be sick.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, do you know what this thing is?",spongebob,1
Stinky.,not spongebob,0
No. It's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo.,spongebob,1
Twins!,not spongebob,0
"Pardon my French, but get this thing off me!",not spongebob,0
Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!,not spongebob,0
It's awake!,not spongebob,0
Let's capture the little phony!,spongebob,1
Get away from me!,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!",not spongebob,0
We don't want your money... moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.,spongebob,1
"Eww, gross.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there's plenty more where those came from.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late?  Whatever this is...  ...it's going on your permanent record!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.",not spongebob,0
There's no time for that! Just push harder.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of...",not spongebob,0
"Nice try, Sandy.",spongebob,1
Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. Hahaha!,not spongebob,0
Aliens? Is that what this is about?  This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot--,not spongebob,0
"It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!",spongebob,1
I didn't even know!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah? Well, I got you now.",spongebob,1
"Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, we aliens would like a word with you!",not spongebob,0
SB-129.,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your ear plugs ready.",not spongebob,0
I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music.  Yow!,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!",spongebob,1
I wonder who that could be.,not spongebob,0
Ready to go?,spongebob,1
"No, I'm not ready to go!",not spongebob,0
He doesn't wanna play with us.,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
How about now?,spongebob,1
No!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
Now?,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0

No!  No!  What?!,not spongebob,0
Ready yet?,spongebob,1
"No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!",not spongebob,0
Sure we do.,spongebob,1
What?  D'oh...!,not spongebob,0
Ready?,spongebob,1
"OUT! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!",not spongebob,0
I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.,spongebob,1
"Hold on a second. I'll be right out.  Hello...?  Ahh, alone at last.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Squidward?  Squidward!  Squidward? Oh, Squidward!  Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!",spongebob,1
"A-ha! They're finally gone!  What the...?  Locked?! Oh no! Oh... well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.",not spongebob,0
"2,000 years later...",not spongebob,0
Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod!,not spongebob,0
I'll be out of here in no time.,not spongebob,0
"Greetings, primitive.",not spongebob,0
Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob? No!  I am Sponge-Tron.  Welcome to the future!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Welcome to the future!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, the future...  Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?",not spongebob,0
Everything is chrome in the future!,not spongebob,0
"Wha...?  Oh, my...  Impossible! He's lying!  He's right!",not spongebob,0
"Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z.",not spongebob,0
Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?,not spongebob,0
Sure! All 486 of them!,not spongebob,0
"Future! Future! Future! Future!  Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!",not spongebob,0
Jellyfishing!,not spongebob,0
"Did somebody say, jellyfishing?",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Pat-Tron!",not spongebob,0
J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!,not spongebob,0
"Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left.  Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior...  Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm.  Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet.  Huh?  Huh? What?!  Huh!?  SpongeBob?  Stay back!  Uh, no thanks.  Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now.  Yes, that's my arm.  Oh, that's sweet.  What, is it time for your flea bath now?  Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish.  Well, I'm going away now.  Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!",not spongebob,0
"What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them!  Give me those loincloths!  I can't believe it.  This oughta make things go a little smoother!  Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this!  It's called jellyfishing.  Ah, finally.  Get me outta here!  Uh-oh.",not spongebob,0
Loser!,not spongebob,0
He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all...  ...alone!,not spongebob,0
Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone!,not spongebob,0
"I gotta get outta of here!  Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?!  I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.",not spongebob,0
Does this mean you wanna go...,spongebob,1
Jellyfishing?,not spongebob,0
No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?,not spongebob,0
"You are, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
I'm going back.,not spongebob,0
You dance divinely.,spongebob,1
Shall we?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I love this song!",spongebob,1
Why are you nitwits in my house?,not spongebob,0
We're bored!,not spongebob,0
And we don't want to be bored!,not spongebob,0
We wanna have fun.,spongebob,1
"Come on, Squidward. Give us something fun to do. Please?",spongebob,1
"Oh, let's play lunch!",not spongebob,0
No problem. I'll whip up some grub.,spongebob,1
Leave my kitchen alone!,not spongebob,0
"Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here.",spongebob,1
Oh! That's it. How would you two like to go on a... scavenger hunt?,not spongebob,0
Scavenger hunt?,not spongebob,0
What's a scavenger hunt?,not spongebob,0
"A party game in which participants work in teams to collect a list of miscellaneous objects! Scavenger hunt, yeah! What's first on the list, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Um, oh, uh, well, let's see.  Bring back the rare Desert Sandwich.",not spongebob,0
Sandwich?,spongebob,1
Sandwich? Sandwich?,spongebob,1
"Not in here! The sandwich is only found deep in the Bikini Badlands, out there!",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Phew. I am a genius.,not spongebob,0
"Goodlands, half a league.",spongebob,1
"Badlands, 20,000 leagues?",spongebob,1
So...thirsty.  Oh.,not spongebob,0
It's no use. We'll never find the rare Desert Sandwich.,spongebob,1
Squidward! We did it! We brought back the first item!,spongebob,1
Sand?,not spongebob,0
"Witch?  Oh, good grief! Not that kind of sand witch! The Desert Sandwich has tomatoes and bread and—and—mayo.",not spongebob,0
"No worries, I used to work at an evil deli.  Ta-da!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, looks pretty good.  Get it off! Get it off!",not spongebob,0
"What's next on our scavenger hunt, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Hmm...oh.  Mm-hmm. Your next item is the Boxing Begonia!  It only grows in the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench.,not spongebob,0
Ooh!,not spongebob,0
Ha. That'll keep them out of my hair.  Oh.,not spongebob,0
It's so straight-downy.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Patrick. A scavenger is always prepared.  The rope is too short! We need another one!",spongebob,1
Here!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Patrick! Where'd you get another rope?",spongebob,1
From that rock!,not spongebob,0
Found it!,spongebob,1
We're back!,spongebob,1
What? But—but it's not possible!  Boxing Begonia? It's beautiful.,not spongebob,0
The champ takes a swift uppercut to the jaw.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward is against the ropes. A left, a right.",spongebob,1
How can a man stand it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, and the champ is down!",spongebob,1
The winner!,not spongebob,0
How do you keep finding everything?,not spongebob,0
You have to keep your skull... numb.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, we're numb skulls!",not spongebob,0
Your next mission is to find  the Loch Ness Monster and bring him back...alive.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, the Loch Ness Monster!",spongebob,1
"Oh, so good! Oh, so good!  What color?",not spongebob,0
"Doesn't matter! Good luck!  They'll never find it. And if they do, it'll eat them.  It's a win-win.",not spongebob,0
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!,spongebob,1
How are we gonna find a monster in the dark? I can't see anything.,not spongebob,0
We don't have to find it. It'll find us.,spongebob,1
I'm the greatest.  And here comes the worst.,not spongebob,0
We're back!,not spongebob,0
The lo—lo— The Loch Ness Monster! How did you find it?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, simple.  Bagpipes.",spongebob,1
It likes bagpipe music?,not spongebob,0
"No, it hates it.",not spongebob,0
Ahh...,not spongebob,0
But it sure loves to eat 'em!,spongebob,1
One very long digestive tract later...,not spongebob,0
Give us another one! Give us another one! Give us another one!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother!  Brother...",not spongebob,0
"Come on, just one more.",spongebob,1
"Well, all right, it's—it's impossible, but...  if only you could find my long lost brother.",not spongebob,0
Brother?,not spongebob,0
I haven't seen him since he was a baby.,not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
Baby with a mustache.,not spongebob,0
He was an early bloomer.,not spongebob,0
What was his name?,spongebob,1
"Name, huh? Um...",not spongebob,0
"Um? Aw, what a pretty name.",spongebob,1
If I could just see him again...  No.,not spongebob,0
That's so sad!,spongebob,1
Even my armpits are crying!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, we've got some extreme scavenging to do!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you.  I'm free!",not spongebob,0
Squidward's brother!,spongebob,1
Squidward's brother!  Squidward's brother?,spongebob,1
Squidward's brother?,not spongebob,0
He's right here! Squidward's brother!,spongebob,1
The rascal shaved his mustache!,not spongebob,0
Good grief.,not spongebob,0
Six months later...,not spongebob,0
Um! Squidward's brother!,spongebob,1
Squidward's brother!,not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Tentacles?  Mrs. Tentacles, you're Squidward's mother. You must know where Squidward's brother is.",spongebob,1
Brother? Squidward never had a brother. One of him was enough.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, that's so sad. Squidward wanted a baby brother so badly he imagined one.",spongebob,1
"Oh, man. Now it'll take even longer to find him.",not spongebob,0
"Hm?  Oh, I'm getting a brainstorm!",spongebob,1
"I've got you, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, let it flow.  Ooh, I have a plan.",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0

Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you.,not spongebob,0
"Get it together, little man.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?",not spongebob,0
What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?,not spongebob,0
"Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there.",not spongebob,0
Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?,not spongebob,0
"Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.",not spongebob,0
Do I still get the money?,not spongebob,0
Of course.,not spongebob,0
That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around.,not spongebob,0
"What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?",spongebob,1
I'm retiring!,not spongebob,0
Retiring?,spongebob,1
I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?,not spongebob,0
I sure am.,spongebob,1
"So long, boys.",not spongebob,0
"Have fun, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Heaven knows I won't.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.",not spongebob,0
New manager?,spongebob,1
I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday’s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.,not spongebob,0
Krabby O'Monday’s?,spongebob,1
You won't be needing these anymore.  Now here are your new uniforms and here are the...  employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O'Monday’s? Not the name I would've chosen, but that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute. I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.",not spongebob,0
"Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year.  Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?",not spongebob,0
How's it going?,not spongebob,0
Fine.,not spongebob,0
Whatcha up to?,not spongebob,0
I'm talking on the phone!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, really?",not spongebob,0
Really.,not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Dad, isn't there something you need to do?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.",not spongebob,0
"Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore!",not spongebob,0
"Get some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday’s.",not spongebob,0
It's my birthday.,not spongebob,0
Can I start you off with...,not spongebob,0
Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday’s birthday song to my special little man?,not spongebob,0
"Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir...",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?",not spongebob,0
Sincere service with a smile?,not spongebob,0
"Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources...  ...would you? So, what's our motto again?",not spongebob,0
Sincere service  with a smile.,not spongebob,0
Now you're gettin' it.,not spongebob,0
"Morning, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?,spongebob,1
"Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out.",not spongebob,0
"I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.",spongebob,1
"Okay, boy, back to work.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, sir.",spongebob,1
I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.,not spongebob,0
Aye aye... Eugene.,spongebob,1
"Ahoy, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you so happy.",not spongebob,0
They're watching us.,not spongebob,0
"That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.",not spongebob,0
I really think you should look.,not spongebob,0
What's this? Help me?,not spongebob,0
"Hey fellas,  what's going on over here?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.",not spongebob,0
"Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter.  Good job, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
What have you done to the real Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"The less you know, Eugene, the better.",not spongebob,0
What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Where's the love?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?",not spongebob,0
I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!,spongebob,1
"This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a word with...",not spongebob,0
Your change is $1.75.,not spongebob,0
"Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?",not spongebob,0
Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre.,not spongebob,0
"That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"See that? Without all your smoke &amp; mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.",not spongebob,0
What'd he say? Garbage?,not spongebob,0
"Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.",not spongebob,0
Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?",not spongebob,0
"You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my.  Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?",not spongebob,0
It's ruined!,not spongebob,0
We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it.,not spongebob,0
I'll buy it for full price.,not spongebob,0
Sold. We won't need your contract anymore.  Nice doing business with you.,not spongebob,0
"Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  Well, we did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.",not spongebob,0
"Really, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"No, not really. Get back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I love you.  And I love you.  And I love you.  Heh—heh—heh.  And I love you too. Oooh.  I tell ya, Mr. Squidward, today's been our  best day of business in years.  Yep, profits are so good, there's nothing that could possibly ruin this perfect—what?! No!",not spongebob,0
Augh!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay?  What's a matter? Is there too much money? I'll get rid of the money.",spongebob,1
"What are you—  Quit masticatin' me moolah!  I ain't upset about the money, boy. I'm upset about him.",not spongebob,0
"Old Man Jenkins? But I love Old Man Jenkins! He always has old and interesting smells,  and his bones make such funny noises,  and his eyes are the milkiest shade of white , and—",spongebob,1
"Every day, it's the same routine...",not spongebob,0
I'll have... a small coffee.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, that'll be 25 cents.",not spongebob,0
"I don't think so, Charlie. I get the senior discount.",not spongebob,0
Then he hogs that table all day...  And annoys all me other customers.,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"And he don't buy nothin' else neither. He just makes that disgustin' condiment soup and listens to his radio, all for free.  And anytime someone says somethin' to him, it's always the same response...",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, could you turn the volume down on your soup?",not spongebob,0
Respect your elders!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, it just makes me so steaming mad!",not spongebob,0
Ooh.  Ahh.,spongebob,1
"Well, I won't stand for it no more!  It's time to kick out the coot!",not spongebob,0
Eh? What's going on now?,not spongebob,0
"Hey! If that's how you treat the elderly, then I'm never eating another Krabby Patty in here again!",not spongebob,0
Me neither. Give the poor old guy a break.,not spongebob,0
"Oh. Uh, it's okay. I—I was just...shaking the dust off him. See?  Ahh! Uh, wait. Let's see here.  Heh, there. Heh—heh—heh.",not spongebob,0
Respect your elders!,not spongebob,0
♪Oohhhhh! Elders are you betters 'cause we're older. So all you whippersnappers get in line! Y'all best be respectful of your elders or we'll whip you with a soup spoon every time! ♪,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Well, gee, Mr. Krabs. If you want Old Man Jenkins to leave, why not just try asking him nicely?",spongebob,1
"I think you oughta be the one to ask him nicely.  Oh, hi. I'm SpongeBob, and I love you, but will you go home, please? Hee—hee—hee—hee.  I'm Old Man Jenkins, and I'm a jerk who likes to cost Mr. Krabs money.  What the?  What is going on, boy-o? Why ain't Jenkins vacatin' me restaurant?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs. I couldn't ask Old Man Jenkins to leave after hearing his story. His feet hurt,  and his grandson never calls,  and he has to take a pill that helps him to remember to take his other pills.  Why, he takes so many pills, he's more pill than man.",spongebob,1
"Okay, time to step it up...to passive aggression.  This'll make him uncomfortable.",not spongebob,0
Ooh. Whew. Ooh.,not spongebob,0
Ehh...ehh…. It's too cold in here for my old blood!  Show a little respect for your elders and turn up the heat!,not spongebob,0
Thank you!,not spongebob,0
"So you can take the heat, but can you take...the beat?",not spongebob,0
I don't understand. How did you endure that cacophony?,not spongebob,0
Eh?  You say something? I'm a little deaf in my ears!,not spongebob,0
Really? Then what's with the radio?,not spongebob,0
I like to cook on the vacuum tubes.  Now show some respect for your elders!,not spongebob,0
"Jenkins, I'm putting me foot down! You're ruining me business, and you're costing me money! Whoo, whoa.  Now, get out!",not spongebob,0
It ain't legal to throw out the elderly in this town. So respect your elders!,not spongebob,0
"Respect...my...elders, hmm?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Old Man Jenkins, I've got someone I'd like you to meet.",not spongebob,0
Hm? What's this about now?,not spongebob,0
This here is me father.  And he is older than you. So you best respect what he has to say.,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy there, Jenkins. Time for you to be hoistin' your sails and movin' on, son!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't thinks so.  This is my father, Very Old Man Jenkins Sr. He's even older than your old man, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
And I say we stay. Both you young 'uns should respect your elders.,not spongebob,0
And I say both you Jenkinses should respect your elder... me grandpappy.,not spongebob,0
Two can play at that game.  Meet Grandpa Jenkins. Ha-ha!,not spongebob,0
I remember the day when Krabby Patties used to cost a dime.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? Well, I remember when they cost a nickel. Hm?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's not give anyone ideas about cheap patties. Now, out with the old, and in with the even older.  Right, Great-Grandpappy Krabs? Ha-ha!",not spongebob,0
"Wake up, Great-Grandpop!  Defend the family's honor!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, respect...someone.",not spongebob,0
Am I an elder?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Great-Great-Grandpa Krabs, return to us! I beseech thee!  Ha! You're older than they are! Kick 'em out!",not spongebob,0
"I want to speak with my Great-Great Grandpa Jenkins!  Get 'em, Ancient-Great-Grand-Pop!",not spongebob,0
"Youthum Ignorami, Elderus Respecticus!",not spongebob,0
Here we go.  Ha-ha!,not spongebob,0
You best respect your elders!,not spongebob,0
"My elders will teach your elders a little respect! Get 'em, Krabses!",not spongebob,0
"Jenkinses, attack!",not spongebob,0
Ha-ha!,not spongebob,0
"Hey. Hey! Uh, you guys are kind of bumming us out.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, we don't get to visit the land of the living very often.",not spongebob,0
And we just want to party!,not spongebob,0
You two party-poopers need to respect your elders and vacate the premises!,not spongebob,0
Looks like it's gonna be a while.,not spongebob,0
What do we do now?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, guys. You've been sitting here all day! Doesn't anyone want to order some chum?",not spongebob,0
"I'll just have a small coffee, please.",not spongebob,0
"I got this one, Krabby... with my senior discount. Here you go, Jimbo.",not spongebob,0
Ow! That's it! Both of you out!,not spongebob,0
Respect your elders!,not spongebob,0
"The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing,  and it's time for the traditional...",not spongebob,0
"Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for your help, Gare!",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?",spongebob,1
It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!,not spongebob,0
"Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!  See ya again next spring.  Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
"Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value.  You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories.  No!  Come on, you!  Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories.  Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow!,not spongebob,0
"Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special.",spongebob,1
"Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.",not spongebob,0
You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.,spongebob,1
"Oh, perfect!  Ah, memories. Greasy memories.",spongebob,1
"Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!",spongebob,1
You're sentimental about your sweat?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!",spongebob,1
"Okay, this is getting creepy now.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, better get these precious memories home.",spongebob,1
Officially creeped out now.,not spongebob,0
"♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪  Hey, Gary.  Oh. Safe and sound!  Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit.",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow, meow.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything.",spongebob,1
Like the front yard!,spongebob,1
Who is it?,spongebob,1
It's Squidward.,not spongebob,0
How do I know it's you?,spongebob,1
"Open the door, nitwit!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?",spongebob,1
You can certainly help...  Why are you wearing garbage?,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning.",spongebob,1
"Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy,  Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?!  You will be missed.",spongebob,1
"Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call.",not spongebob,0
Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.,not spongebob,0
"Thank goodness you're here, officer.",not spongebob,0
Is this your filthy home?,not spongebob,0
"No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!",not spongebob,0
Hi!,spongebob,1
"Thanks for the information, citizen.",not spongebob,0
"Hmph, snitch.",not spongebob,0
"Do your duty, Sergeant.",not spongebob,0
This residence is now comdemned.,not spongebob,0
Condemned? What does that mean?,spongebob,1
Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.,not spongebob,0
Vacate? You mean I have to move?,spongebob,1
Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sergeant.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you again, officers.",not spongebob,0
Wait! Please don't condemn my house.,spongebob,1
"Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.",not spongebob,0
I'll request a commendation for you.,not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
Right after we condemn your house!,not spongebob,0
My house?!,not spongebob,0
Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's.,not spongebob,0
But isn't there anything we can do?,spongebob,1
You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.,not spongebob,0
Throw them away?,spongebob,1
"Thank you for the attempt, ma'am.",not spongebob,0
Ma'am? It's a nightshirt!  This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!,not spongebob,0
I know.  I'm gonna miss them so much!,spongebob,1
You really miss them?,not spongebob,0
No. I'll be strong.,spongebob,1
"Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.",not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!",spongebob,1
Creepy.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, good grief.",not spongebob,0
"Your pay, my good man.",spongebob,1
"Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump!",spongebob,1
"Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, nighty-night.",spongebob,1
"Idiot.  What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house.",spongebob,1
Nice dress.,not spongebob,0
It's a nightshirt!,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!",not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Blackbeard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. (walks inside, and to the kitchen) It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-",not spongebob,0
Bawk! In what way?,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.",not spongebob,0
Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!,not spongebob,0
"Argh...  Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go?  Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",not spongebob,0
"Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!  Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your land-lubbing cartoons. This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to, call the number that's scrolling down there at the bottom of the screen: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com.  No, not now! Don't call till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because-  You're not gonna make this easy, are ya? Quiet! I'm not there! Belate that ringing! Stop! It's driving me mad!",not spongebob,0
"(yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!",spongebob,1
That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!",not spongebob,0
I know! What do you think we should name it?,spongebob,1
How about...,not spongebob,0
Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!,not spongebob,0
"We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!",spongebob,1
Clean...,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.",not spongebob,0
Wouldn't that be the top?,spongebob,1
"Squid, wait! Wait!",spongebob,1
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
A few inches later...,not spongebob,0
Ship!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?",not spongebob,0
"No, look, a giant ship!",spongebob,1
Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.",spongebob,1
That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.,not spongebob,0
"Squid, wait!",spongebob,1
"All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!",not spongebob,0
Doesn't this place seem familiar?,spongebob,1
I don't know. Why?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?,spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.,spongebob,1
Rawr!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, it's not rawr!",spongebob,1
I am the Flying Dutchman!,not spongebob,0
"That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!",spongebob,1
Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?,not spongebob,0
It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.,spongebob,1
"I...no, I don't.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?",spongebob,1
I never said that.,not spongebob,0
Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.",spongebob,1
Ow.,not spongebob,0
You're next!,not spongebob,0
That was a close one!,not spongebob,0
Welcome back!,not spongebob,0
That was a closer one!,spongebob,1
Welcome back!,not spongebob,0
"Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...",not spongebob,0
"So, are you gonna try that again?",not spongebob,0
Probably.,not spongebob,0
How 'bout now?,not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
"No, no, they're not. Whew.",not spongebob,0
"Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.",not spongebob,0
Will we be getting business cards?,not spongebob,0
"Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.",not spongebob,0
"Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?",not spongebob,0
Would anyone else like to enter the Fly of Despair?,not spongebob,0
"No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.",spongebob,1
We'll do anything you say!,not spongebob,0
"Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!",spongebob,1
And I got this hat!,not spongebob,0
"Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!",not spongebob,0
"You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...",spongebob,1
"No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.",not spongebob,0
Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!,spongebob,1
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
"Look, it's easy, it simply means that...",spongebob,1
"Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.",not spongebob,0
"So, you don't want it to look good?",spongebob,1
Get moving!,not spongebob,0

Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!,not spongebob,0
"Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!",not spongebob,0
"Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.",spongebob,1
"I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.",not spongebob,0
Moving behind the rocks!,not spongebob,0
"Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.",spongebob,1
"All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.",not spongebob,0
Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!,not spongebob,0
"Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.",spongebob,1
With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!,not spongebob,0
How does he do that?,not spongebob,0
Get back on the ship.,not spongebob,0
It's still a mystery!,not spongebob,0
Those guys are dorks.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, but they're my dorks.",not spongebob,0
You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?,spongebob,1
Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!,not spongebob,0
Like movie passes?,spongebob,1
Or an oversized coffee mug?!,not spongebob,0
I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.,not spongebob,0
You're setting us free?,spongebob,1
"Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, I have an idea!",not spongebob,0
Really?! What is it?,spongebob,1
Let's leave!,not spongebob,0
But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.,spongebob,1
Let's do it.,not spongebob,0
I always hate going in there!,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Wait! Listen!,spongebob,1
"Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...",not spongebob,0
Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!,not spongebob,0
Never!,spongebob,1
"Okay, then...  Give it to me!",not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
"Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!",not spongebob,0
It would seem we have reached an impasse.,not spongebob,0
"Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.",not spongebob,0
Make it five.,not spongebob,0
Four.,not spongebob,0
Three. Take it or leave it.,not spongebob,0
"Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?",spongebob,1
Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you got two wishes left.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!",spongebob,1
"Boy, I'm glad all that's over!",not spongebob,0
Squidward! You're back!,not spongebob,0
"Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.",spongebob,1
"Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!",not spongebob,0
"Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's not right because...",spongebob,1
"That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...",not spongebob,0
All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good Ol' SpongeBob? Just dial the number below: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing.  My trusty crew is eagerly awaiting your call.  So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, and we'll be right back to announce...the winner!  That's it, kids! Keep calling! It's almost time! Get those votes in! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! Democracy! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy. Please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. A-HA-HA-HA!  Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank!  Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner!  But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter-ology, you didn't choose...Patrick.  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh god!",not spongebob,0
My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it!,not spongebob,0
"That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.",spongebob,1
Um...,not spongebob,0
"Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time...  Understand?!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.",spongebob,1
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
That's not gonna do it! Think harder!,spongebob,1
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
"Come on! You can do it! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Think really hard! Put on your thinking cap!",not spongebob,0
Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.,not spongebob,0
Thy wish is granted.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?",not spongebob,0
You wished for gum?,not spongebob,0
"Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, minty.",not spongebob,0
"Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Malarkey! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh!  It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Meeny-Miney-Mo finger landed on Squidward!",not spongebob,0
You are it!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!",spongebob,1
That's right! And you know what I wish?,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!,not spongebob,0
So be it.,not spongebob,0
"Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hi.,not spongebob,0
That's not what I meant!,not spongebob,0
"Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner.",not spongebob,0
And what did you say your name was?,spongebob,1
I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.",spongebob,1
"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because it's time to announce...the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is...SpongeBob!  Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!",not spongebob,0
"Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk!",not spongebob,0
"And now, the most requested ending! Hooray!",not spongebob,0
You are it!,not spongebob,0
"Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
We're home!,spongebob,1
"You did it, SpongeBob. We're safe!",not spongebob,0
But why have we been turned into fruits?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy!  Hey, get back here with that!",not spongebob,0
"Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lubbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now you're an official big time cartoon decision maker!  Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!",not spongebob,0
Squawk! I quit! I quit!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's it folks. Right now, I've got a little employee management to take care of. Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage!",not spongebob,0
Brawk! I don't think so!,not spongebob,0
"And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special. Thanks for voting.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"And now, it's time for Patchy's Pick. Hosted by: SpongeBob's number one fan, Patchy the Pirate.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today.  We're gonna see me favorite show, Shanghaied! Ta-da!",not spongebob,0
Boring!,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.",not spongebob,0
Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!,not spongebob,0
"Argh...  Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go?  Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",not spongebob,0
"Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!  Well, roll the cartoon.",not spongebob,0
"(yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!",spongebob,1
That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!",not spongebob,0
I know! What do you think we should name it?,spongebob,1
How about...,not spongebob,0
Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!,not spongebob,0
"We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!",spongebob,1
Clean...,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.",not spongebob,0
Wouldn't that be the top?,spongebob,1
"Squid, wait! Wait!",spongebob,1
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
A few inches later...,not spongebob,0
Ship!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?",not spongebob,0
"No, look, a giant ship!",spongebob,1
Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.",spongebob,1
That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.,not spongebob,0
"Squid, wait!",spongebob,1
"All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!",not spongebob,0
Doesn't this place seem familiar?,spongebob,1
I don't know. Why?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?,spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.,spongebob,1
Rawr!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, it's not rawr!",spongebob,1
I am the Flying Dutchman!,not spongebob,0
"That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!",spongebob,1
Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?,not spongebob,0
It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.,spongebob,1
"I...no, I don't.",not spongebob,0
"Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?",spongebob,1
I never said that.,not spongebob,0
Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.",spongebob,1
Ow.,not spongebob,0
You're next!,not spongebob,0
That was a close one!,not spongebob,0
Welcome back!,not spongebob,0
That was a closer one!,spongebob,1
Welcome back!,not spongebob,0
"Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...",not spongebob,0
"So, are you gonna try that again?",not spongebob,0
Probably.,not spongebob,0
How 'bout now?,not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
"No, no, they're not. Whew.",not spongebob,0
"Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.",not spongebob,0
Will we be getting business cards?,not spongebob,0
"Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.",not spongebob,0
"Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?",not spongebob,0
Would anyone else like to enter the Fly of Despair?,not spongebob,0
"No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.",spongebob,1
We'll do anything you say!,not spongebob,0
"Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!",spongebob,1
And I got this hat!,not spongebob,0
"Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!",not spongebob,0
"You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...",spongebob,1
"No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.",not spongebob,0
Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!,spongebob,1
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
"Look, it's easy, it simply means that...",spongebob,1
"Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.",not spongebob,0
"So, you don't want it to look good?",spongebob,1
Get moving!,not spongebob,0
A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!,not spongebob,0

How does he do that?,not spongebob,0
Get back on the ship.,not spongebob,0
It's still a mystery!,not spongebob,0

"Yes, but they're my dorks.",not spongebob,0
You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?,spongebob,1

"Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...",not spongebob,0
"So, are you gonna try that again?",not spongebob,0
Probably.,not spongebob,0
How 'bout now?,not spongebob,0
Uhh...,not spongebob,0
"No, no, they're not. Whew.",not spongebob,0
"Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! And, uhh , ever.",not spongebob,0
Will we be getting business cards?,not spongebob,0
"Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.",not spongebob,0
"Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?",not spongebob,0
Would anyone else like to enter the Fly of Despair?,not spongebob,0
"No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.",not spongebob,0
We'll do anything you say!,not spongebob,0
"Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!",not spongebob,0
"Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!",not spongebob,0
And I got this hat!,not spongebob,0
"Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!",not spongebob,0
"You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...",not spongebob,0
"No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.",not spongebob,0
Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!,not spongebob,0
I don't get it.,not spongebob,0
"Look, it's easy, it simply means that...",not spongebob,0
"Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.",not spongebob,0
"So, you don't want it to look good?",not spongebob,0
Get moving!,not spongebob,0
A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!,not spongebob,0
"What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!",not spongebob,0
Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!,not spongebob,0
Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!,not spongebob,0
"Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!",not spongebob,0
"Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.",not spongebob,0
"I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.",not spongebob,0
Moving behind the rocks!,not spongebob,0
"Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.",not spongebob,0
"All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.",not spongebob,0
Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!,not spongebob,0
"Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.",not spongebob,0
With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!,not spongebob,0
How does he do that?,not spongebob,0
Get back on the ship.,not spongebob,0
It's still a mystery!,not spongebob,0
Those guys are dorks.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, but they're my dorks.",not spongebob,0
You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?,not spongebob,0
Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!,not spongebob,0
Like movie passes?,not spongebob,0
Or an oversized coffee mug?!,not spongebob,0
I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.,not spongebob,0
You're setting us free?,not spongebob,0
"Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, I have an idea!",not spongebob,0
Really?! What is it?,not spongebob,0
Let's leave!,not spongebob,0
But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.,not spongebob,0
Let's do it.,not spongebob,0
I always hate going in there!,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Wait! Listen!,not spongebob,0
"Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...  Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!",not spongebob,0
Never!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, then... Give it to me!",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!",not spongebob,0
It would seem we have reached an impasse.,not spongebob,0
"Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.",not spongebob,0
Make it five.,not spongebob,0
Four.,not spongebob,0
Three. Take it or leave it.,not spongebob,0
"Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?",not spongebob,0
Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you got two wishes left.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!",not spongebob,0
"Boy, I'm glad all that's over!",not spongebob,0
Squidward! You're back!,not spongebob,0
"Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.",not spongebob,0
"Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!",not spongebob,0
"Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's not right because...",not spongebob,0
"That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Closing time already?,not spongebob,0
I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.,spongebob,1
"Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?",spongebob,1
I thought those things ate mostly kibble.,not spongebob,0
It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...,spongebob,1
"Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, did you forget?",spongebob,1
Probably.,not spongebob,0
Tomorrow is Bring Your Pet To Work day!,spongebob,1
I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!,not spongebob,0
Nice.  REAL NICE!,not spongebob,0
Umm... Can I buy that patty?,spongebob,1
Yeah. Sure.,not spongebob,0
Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.",not spongebob,0
"Good idea!  Thanks again, Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Whoa, what?",not spongebob,0
"What, what?!",not spongebob,0
We're all out of Krabby Patties!,spongebob,1
Did you check the freezer?!,not spongebob,0
"I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!",spongebob,1
What about the freezer in the attic?,not spongebob,0
We don't have an attic.,spongebob,1
No attic?!,not spongebob,0
"You sold it, remember?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Now what are they saying, Karen? Karen?!",not spongebob,0
I have no idea.,not spongebob,0
What? I thought you said you could read lips!,not spongebob,0
"I can, but you took my telescope away!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
A fresh batch?,spongebob,1
That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, now what's he saying?",not spongebob,0
He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
"A fresh batch of—ooh, this is good. This is really good!",not spongebob,0
"When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, what'd he just say?",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"I said, What'd he just say?",not spongebob,0
"He said, What?",not spongebob,0
"I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!",not spongebob,0
"I know that, and I'm saying he said, What?!",not spongebob,0
"I know that! Wait... oh, he said, What?.",not spongebob,0
Yes!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!",spongebob,1
"You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule Bring Your Pet To Work day.",not spongebob,0
"No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!",spongebob,1
"Oh, okay. Just make sure he's healthy and clean!",not spongebob,0
"Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!",not spongebob,0
Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries.  I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy those.  Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary?  Gary?  Gary?!  Gary, not again. Come out of there, it's dirty!  Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou....",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Great, Gary, just great. Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not gonna come down from there, are you?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...",not spongebob,0
Gary! I'm going to start the bath!,spongebob,1
"Look, I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be...",not spongebob,0
Gary! The bath is ready!,spongebob,1
"...all yours! Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course.",not spongebob,0
Gary! Your bath is ready!,spongebob,1
"Have a pleasant stay! Bon voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!",not spongebob,0
"Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for Bring your pet to work day! And today is the day!  First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!",spongebob,1
Wha...?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?",spongebob,1
Ugh...,not spongebob,0
Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime!,spongebob,1
"Bet that feels good, huh?",spongebob,1
Curses! I mean... meow?,not spongebob,0
"Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?",spongebob,1
"I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow!",not spongebob,0
Gary! You're turning green! And talking!,spongebob,1
"No, I'm not.",not spongebob,0
We gotta get you to the pet hospital!,spongebob,1
"Pet hospital?! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!",not spongebob,0
"You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick.  Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
Is that yes? Or no?,spongebob,1
I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!,not spongebob,0
Intensive care unit?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals.",spongebob,1
"Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.",not spongebob,0
Don't worry. We're just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it.,not spongebob,0
"Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests.",not spongebob,0
That's not what I'm saying at all.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary!",spongebob,1
"Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can. We just can't find out anything wrong with him. I've never seen anything like it.",not spongebob,0
"Please try to save him, doctor!",spongebob,1
No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...,not spongebob,0
"Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.",not spongebob,0
Whew! That's a relief.,not spongebob,0
"Now, open wide.",not spongebob,0
"That wasn't so bad, was it?  That's not good.  Uh, Mr. SquarePants?",not spongebob,0
Gary!,spongebob,1
The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.,not spongebob,0
"You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh.  Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end.",spongebob,1
If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go...,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know, it's... it's really poignant.",spongebob,1
What is?,not spongebob,0
"Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you!",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy...",not spongebob,0
"So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon.",not spongebob,0
"Just a little further, Gare-Bare.",spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
"Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear.",spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!",not spongebob,0
"Mommy? Hey, wait!",not spongebob,0
Plankton?,not spongebob,0
"Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going already!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay.",spongebob,1
"Well, he takes after you, boy.  Pay?!",not spongebob,0
Easy...  Perfection!,spongebob,1
"Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away.",spongebob,1
"Oh, brother.  Number 5. Number 5!",not spongebob,0
"That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?",spongebob,1
"Come out here, boy.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.",not spongebob,0
What's a hidey-hole?,spongebob,1
"It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!",not spongebob,0
What's in this thing? Treasure?,spongebob,1
A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.,not spongebob,0
"Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?",spongebob,1
"Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?",spongebob,1
Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo.,not spongebob,0
Neat.,spongebob,1
And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'.,not spongebob,0
How'd you win that?,spongebob,1
By being the toughest of the tough!,not spongebob,0
Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?,spongebob,1
"Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's 'Ol Iron Eye, , and Mutton Chop, , me, , Torpedo Belly, , and Lockjaw Jones.",not spongebob,0
"Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Of course! I was called Armor Abs Krabs.,not spongebob,0
You were?,spongebob,1
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess you were thinner back then.",spongebob,1
"Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.",not spongebob,0
You want me to punch you in the stomach?,spongebob,1
Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!,not spongebob,0
"wow, my entire arm disintegrated.",spongebob,1
I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail.",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?,spongebob,1
Don't look at me! Leave me be!,not spongebob,0
You're alive! And naked...,spongebob,1
It's true. I've molted.,not spongebob,0
What's molted?,spongebob,1
"It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!",not spongebob,0
Wow.,spongebob,1
'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab!,not spongebob,0
Barnacles!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.",spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Who cares how silly, pink &amp; fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp &amp; soft you are. How...  ...oops.",spongebob,1
"I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good...",not spongebob,0
"Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're a genius.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not about what's on the outside. It's what's on the in...",spongebob,1
"No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.",not spongebob,0
I get to be a navy buddy?,spongebob,1
"Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years.",spongebob,1
"Alright, show me what you got.",not spongebob,0
"Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.",spongebob,1
"Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.",not spongebob,0
I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.,spongebob,1
That's me.,not spongebob,0
"Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, okay, I get the point.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel.",spongebob,1
"That'll do, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them!",spongebob,1
"No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"I won't let you down, sir.",spongebob,1
Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.,not spongebob,0
Coming!,spongebob,1
"Oh, what have I done?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.",spongebob,1
I've created a monster.,not spongebob,0
"Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?",not spongebob,0
Like pineapple? I live in one.,spongebob,1
That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.,not spongebob,0
I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if you think you're man enough.",spongebob,1
"Uh-oh, this could be bad.",not spongebob,0
Fire the torpedoes.,spongebob,1
"What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times.",not spongebob,0
A tooth.,not spongebob,0
"Teeth. Now, that's manly.",not spongebob,0
He did it.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.",not spongebob,0
This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.,not spongebob,0
Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for the trophy, everybody.",spongebob,1
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!,not spongebob,0
I...uhh...,spongebob,1
Say something.,not spongebob,0
Let me spin you a manly yarn.,spongebob,1
'Atta boy.,not spongebob,0
"So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.",spongebob,1
I'm doomed.,not spongebob,0
Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...,spongebob,1
Did he say Jellyfish Fields?,not spongebob,0
Blowing bubbles?,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?",not spongebob,0
"Why, jellyfishing, of course.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Phone call for Mr. Krabs!   Get off the stage.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks.",spongebob,1
Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.,not spongebob,0
Oh no.,not spongebob,0
"Number one, is spend a penny.",not spongebob,0
"And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean,  arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.",spongebob,1
I can't watch.,not spongebob,0
Armor Abs?,not spongebob,0
"Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.",spongebob,1
"No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"None taken, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"C'mon, lad, let's go home.",not spongebob,0
Wait a minute! You've forgotten something.,not spongebob,0
I don't understand.,not spongebob,0
"Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession.  These are fake!",not spongebob,0
Over here.,not spongebob,0
"You, too, Torpedo Belly?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.",not spongebob,0
And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.,not spongebob,0
My iron eye is actually made of Formica.,not spongebob,0
"Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back.",not spongebob,0
"Hello? Hello!  Huh? The line’s been cut.  Barnacles!  I guess I’d go better take a look.   Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ha, hey!  Aha, wind-up novelty teeth! How did you wind up down here? Dahaha!  What the heck is going on with my fancy boot?  Hey, knock it off!  Alright, I warned you!  You're a dirty fighter... I got you now! Hiya!  Gary?  Noooooooooo!  Gary!  Hooa!  Phew! Thank goodness. For a minute, I thought you were hurt.   Gary, I've - I've broke your shell.",spongebob,1
Meoooow!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no, you're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better.  Sorry about that. Oh, I know,  here, just use a little tape and there ya go, good as new!  Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya.  SpongeBob",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, you're right, too gaudy.  No, too last season.  Well, I need that. Ahahaha, look, Gary!  Here, try this on for size.",spongebob,1
Meow...,not spongebob,0
"Of course it's a shell.  Aw, come on, don't look at me like that.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you're right, it's not a shell.  Oh!  Greetings, earthling, I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. Dahahaha.  I bet this'll look great. . Ew. I can see why snail shells aren't clear.  Hmmm.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0

You're just in time for the tea party!,not spongebob,0
"Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.",spongebob,1

Take a hike!,not spongebob,0
Don't we get enough of you during the day?,not spongebob,0
Meow!,not spongebob,0
Does anyone have a quarter?,not spongebob,0
"Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you.  All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple.  Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing.  And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...!",not spongebob,0
"Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.",spongebob,1

We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.,spongebob,1
We're gonna win the trophy.,not spongebob,0
Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going.,not spongebob,0
"You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend.",spongebob,1
"No, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye.",not spongebob,0
"Ruling, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I think we better raise the bar.,spongebob,1
"Hiya, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Contestants 51 and 52 to the stage, please.",not spongebob,0

"Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in.",not spongebob,0
"Contestant 53 to the stage, please.",not spongebob,0
"Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please.",not spongebob,0

Excuse me?,not spongebob,0
"You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.",not spongebob,0
"But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Doh, help me up.",not spongebob,0
"How'd the audition go, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"The audition? My trophy?  I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition.  Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.",not spongebob,0
Whoa.,not spongebob,0
"Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?",spongebob,1
What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.,not spongebob,0
Like polishing your empty trophy case?,not spongebob,0
"Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?",not spongebob,0
Deal.,not spongebob,0
"Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Ok, here I go. Watch me now.  Cramp!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and...  Having fun?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes I am.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...plié.  Relevé.  And now grand jeté.  Where am I? See if I can find the lights.  Wait a minute.  This gives me an idea.  Ready, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Ready!,spongebob,1
"A one and a two, and...  Plié, jeté, relevé -  No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.",not spongebob,0
How'd you know?,spongebob,1
"Gimme those.  That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing?  Why are you moving your arms like that?",not spongebob,0
I guess they're happy.,spongebob,1
"Argh, hand 'em over.  And the other one, come on.  Ah, now that's more like it.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.",spongebob,1
Are you questioning my leadership.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I just...",spongebob,1
"Ok, hand it over.",not spongebob,0
"You know what, Squidward?",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.,spongebob,1
"Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.",not spongebob,0
Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.,spongebob,1
Quit groveling. Where is your dignity?  These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.,not spongebob,0
"Now that's what I like to call a hard act to follow. Next up, we have SpongeBob SquarePants.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, man. I can't wait. I am so stoked on dancing right now.",not spongebob,0
"Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight.",spongebob,1
Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.",spongebob,1
Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.,not spongebob,0
What's he doing?,not spongebob,0
Is he hurt?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know man, but it's hurting my eyes.",not spongebob,0
I think I'm gonna be sick.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see...  Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys, wait up. Huh? What's this?  That's kind of nice. Hey guys, come check this out.",not spongebob,0

"Mine!  I won, I won!",not spongebob,0
"Never before have I seen such zest, such joie de vivre.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone.",spongebob,1
"Wait, SpongeBob, no!",not spongebob,0
"The rulebook clearly states A single dancer must perform without any further assistance from a partner. Therefore, you're the winner.",not spongebob,0
"Oh man, the jig's up, Pedro. We're going home.",not spongebob,0
"It's all right, I'll go call a taxi.",not spongebob,0
Merciful Neptune. Are there any more cheaters?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, crud, we're two dancers.",not spongebob,0
"We're nine dancers, actually.",not spongebob,0
Does this count?,not spongebob,0
Isn't there a single dancer here who is not assisted by a partner?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, what about number 52 over there?",not spongebob,0
Is he alone?,not spongebob,0
"Well, let me see.  Why, yes, he is a single dancer.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, then. I guess he wins.",not spongebob,0
"I love your new dance, Patrick.",spongebob,1

"Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab.  Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him.",spongebob,1
"Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique.",spongebob,1
Kelpy's not for everyone.,not spongebob,0
"That was Kelpy G. Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean. Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out.",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are…  sorry, sold out.",spongebob,1
"Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?",not spongebob,0
You forgot to buy a ticket?,spongebob,1
"Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there.  Oh wait, I just realized... I'll be having the greatest time of my life!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?",spongebob,1
"Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it!",not spongebob,0
You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.,spongebob,1
This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonight’s concert. We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the dream is still alive!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you are lucky loser number one. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number five. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number nine. Please, try again. Twenty-two. Try again. Twenty-seven. Sixty-five.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam.",not spongebob,0
Hello! You're winning caller number 102.,not spongebob,0
I am?,spongebob,1
"Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself.",not spongebob,0
"Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be.",spongebob,1
"Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G!",spongebob,1
"Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits.",not spongebob,0
You can say that again. It's a rare treat to mingle with true diehard smooth jazzists.,not spongebob,0
"You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!",spongebob,1
Was it you who brought the raucous miscreant?,not spongebob,0
Me? No. Of course not. No.,not spongebob,0
See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.,not spongebob,0
Just keep your friends outbursts under control.,not spongebob,0
"Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir.",spongebob,1
What wig?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, just look at that lemonade line.",spongebob,1
"That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade.",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade.",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
It's right behind you SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Oh! Why don't I get one for you?,spongebob,1
"Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—",spongebob,1
"Well, okay, if you insist.",not spongebob,0
"Alright. One lemonade, coming up.",spongebob,1
"See you after the show, Spongee-G.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance. I just love this tune.",not spongebob,0
"Hey hey, a fellow mellow jazz-dazzler. What's happening?",not spongebob,0
Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.,not spongebob,0
I'm picking up what you're laying down. You can groove with us any time.,not spongebob,0
Don't mind if I do groove.,not spongebob,0
Look what I found!,spongebob,1
What the…? What?,not spongebob,0
Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand!,spongebob,1
"Hey, nice tune.  Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?",spongebob,1
"Kazoo? Your friend knows absolutely nothing of Kelpy G, man!",not spongebob,0
Are you friends with Squidward?,spongebob,1
Friends? I should think not. We only associate with true jazz-dazzlers.,not spongebob,0
But I dazzle. Oh.,not spongebob,0
"Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people.",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sponge! Would you just sit down and shut your mouth?",not spongebob,0
"Well, thank you for speaking up.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, all you snazzy jazzlers. Please put your thumbs and forefingers together and give a warm welcome to the pied piper of jazz himself— Kelpy G.",not spongebob,0
Bravo! Bravo! It's so exciting!,not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup?",not spongebob,0
No I don't — ketchup?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what brought you here?",spongebob,1
"Two words, SpongeBob— na chos.",not spongebob,0
"Two words, Patrick— get lost.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa— huh?",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa—",spongebob,1
Tummy want more.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy.",spongebob,1
I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half.  What the...?,not spongebob,0
"I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes.  Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now.",not spongebob,0
Get 'im!,not spongebob,0
You're so light.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, come back here with those backstage passes.",not spongebob,0
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where do you think you're going?,not spongebob,0
But our friend just took our—,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about the whosits or the whatsits. Clear the aisle and go back to your seat.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, at least we still have our seats.",not spongebob,0
"You got a problem, tentacle head?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya?  You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this—  Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G.",not spongebob,0
"Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub.",not spongebob,0
"We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, this is a private area. Only people with backstage passes can come back here.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience.",spongebob,1
What are you talking about? I'm Kelpy G's manager. Now read my lips.,not spongebob,0
"No backstage passes, no entry.",not spongebob,0
"And no seeing Kelpy G, got it?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!",not spongebob,0
"Get up, man. Have some dignity.",not spongebob,0
"But, but, but… what if I told you, uh… I'm a clarinet player myself.  I call this one, Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars. Wait. Hold for it.",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh!,spongebob,1
"Right this way, Mr. G.",not spongebob,0
"Another show, another intermission.",not spongebob,0
"Your dressing room is right over here, sir.",not spongebob,0
Hold on a smooth second.,not spongebob,0
Who let those two back here? That sounds horrible. I'll get 'im right out.,not spongebob,0
"No, no. I agree. The clarinet sound abysmal, but that ukulele. Genius. And his clogs. They're just like mine, see? Excuse me, young man.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet—",not spongebob,0
And what might you be called?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob SquarePants.,spongebob,1
"Come, young protege, let us woo the crowd with sounds of heavenly delight.  At this time, I'd like to welcome a very special guest to the stage — Mr. SpongeBob SmoothPants.",not spongebob,0
"This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy.  But I'm a musician!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, a happy pineapple under the sea. Let's take a peek inside, shall we?",not spongebob,0
"You will notice that the sponge is bored, because his best friend Patrick is away.",not spongebob,0
Ohh!,spongebob,1
Hmm... what's this?,spongebob,1
"All alone? No one to talk to? Why not write to a total stranger? Connect with other Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Pen Pals Today! Oh, I've never had a pen pal!",spongebob,1
"Hmm... Dear Pen Pal, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants... Oh, that's great! I work at a restaurant. I love frying and I'm very good at it. Sincerely, your new best friend! Behold, the perfect letter! Now for the envelope.",spongebob,1
"Gary, get off of that! You'll spoil my masterpiece!",spongebob,1
"Meow, meow.",not spongebob,0
Uh-oh. It looks as if the domesticated snail has unintentionally deformed the word Frying. Making it look like the word Flying. This is probably going to be a problem later on.,not spongebob,0
"Nah, it's just a little slime.",spongebob,1
"Ah, perfect!",spongebob,1
4 to 6 days later...,not spongebob,0
"Dear SpongeBob, Wow! You know how to fly? Fly? What does he mean by...",spongebob,1
See? What did I tell you?,not spongebob,0
"Gary, my pen pal thinks I can fly!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Ha! What a silly misunderstanding. I can't believe I know a real life pilot! I wish I could watch you fly, because I am dying!  Dying?! Not Pen Pal!",spongebob,1
"I don't want to let him down and say that I can't fly! 'Cause then, his dying wish will never come true!",spongebob,1
We're gathered here today to celebrate the life of Pen Pal. He died disappointed.,not spongebob,0
Time to make Pen Pal's wish come true with a tiny white lie!,spongebob,1
"Dearest Pen Pal, yes, I can fly! Boy, do I love flying! Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!",spongebob,1
4 to 6 more days later...,not spongebob,0
"Dear SpongeBob, I'll be at the Bikini Bottom Air Show tomorrow. Please meet me there so I can finally see you fly?!  Oh no! What have I done? What have I done? What have I done? I can't fly, Gary! I'm not a flier! I'm a liar!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good thinking, Gary.  Sandy will know just what to do.",spongebob,1
"What can I do ya for, SquarePants?",not spongebob,0
"I did a bad thing, Sandy! I did a very bad thing!",spongebob,1
Here. Take these. They're clean.,not spongebob,0
"No, no. It's not that. It's... it's...",spongebob,1
I lied!  I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied!,spongebob,1
"Relax, SpongeBob. You're twitchin' like a prairie dog on a cow-skin rug.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, what on a which?",spongebob,1
What's got your behind a-buzzin'?,not spongebob,0
By who I've a where's in?,spongebob,1
"What did you lie about, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Well, there was this big misunderstanding and now my pen pal thinks I can fly! And I don't think I ever mean it, but now I have to! If he doesn't see me fly and I don't know how! If I don't fly, he'll die disappointed! I made a horrible mistake, Sandy! Please help!",spongebob,1
"Well, it ain't no lie if you actually learn how to fly. And I can help you with that!",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
Sure.,not spongebob,0
"Seatbelt, check. Controls, check.",spongebob,1
"Proper take off, check. How are ya doing in there?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm good.",spongebob,1
"Oh, there's my house!",spongebob,1
Oop. I've forgot to feed Gary.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi Gary.",spongebob,1
"Failed. Alright, let's try that again! SpongeBob? Hmm?",not spongebob,0
"Alright, SpongeBob. I tied ya up to a rope so you won't be able to go too far off course.",not spongebob,0
Contact!,not spongebob,0
I'm doing it! I'm actually doing it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
Did I do it?,spongebob,1
Hmm. Good enough.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you must be Pen Pal!",spongebob,1
"What an honor it is to finally meet you! Oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you.",spongebob,1
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"I just wanted to say that today... Today...  Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you. Oh, I will not let you down.",spongebob,1
"My heart is full too, Pen Pal.  My heart is full too.",spongebob,1
Whew! That was a close one! What was that guy talking about?,not spongebob,0
"Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Feast your eyes upon one daring, death-defying, the Polaris, the incredible, flying sponge!",not spongebob,0
Take off. Don't die. Fly a few seconds lower to the ground. Don't die. Slam. Don't die. So simple.,spongebob,1
Steve's the name and scythes on the game! You need a scythe? Steve's got ya covered! One scythe fits all!,not spongebob,0
"Get outta here, Steve!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I gotta say in it.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, I'm nervous.",spongebob,1
"No, it's still not that.",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob. You'll be, uh, just fine. Yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Get ready, boys! The bronco is loose! I repeat, the bronco is loose!",not spongebob,0
Just fine.,spongebob,1
"Pen Pal, this one's for you.",spongebob,1
Whoo-hoo! I'm flying! Yee-haw!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob! I can't believe you can actually fly like you said in your letter!",not spongebob,0
Patrick? You're Pen Pal?,spongebob,1
Duh!,not spongebob,0
But... but you said you were dying! You're not dying!,spongebob,1
"Dying? Oh, oh! You didn't read the whole letter!",not spongebob,0
"See? It says, I wish I could watch you fly because I am dying!",spongebob,1
"And here's the second page! To see you as a real pilot, SpongeBob. Here are some other things I like to see: candy rain, a firetruck full of clowns, and... a bunch of other stuff.",not spongebob,0
"It all makes sense now!  Oh, Patrick!",spongebob,1
You thought I was dying!,not spongebob,0
Watch out!,not spongebob,0
"Candy rain, check!",not spongebob,0
"Firetruck clowns, check!",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me!",spongebob,1
Heave-ho!,not spongebob,0
"Fly first class, check!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, something's wrong with the plane! Here, take the controls!",spongebob,1
Take what now?,not spongebob,0
"Match point, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo! Check and check!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Who's flying the plane?!",spongebob,1
I am!,not spongebob,0
"No, wait.",not spongebob,0
Hold on! We're going down!,spongebob,1
Whew! We ran out of gas.,spongebob,1
"Uh, don't worry! I've got this!  Yep!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it was my pleasure.",spongebob,1
"Really? Well, if you don't mind, I have a couple of other things I'd like to see.",not spongebob,0
Let's hear 'em.,spongebob,1
"An edible balloon, a skateboarding snail, a tower of loose meat that tastes like ice cream, some ghosts...",not spongebob,0
"Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg.  This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes  stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate  for tropical, undersea life.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet,  but a blanket... a blanket of snow!  Yes, from Jellyfish Fields...  to residential abodes...  to bustling downtown...  it's nothing but the white stuff.",not spongebob,0
Whoopee!,spongebob,1
And local residents are taking notice!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you!",not spongebob,0
"Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this?",spongebob,1
"Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?",spongebob,1
Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!,not spongebob,0
"Well, first, you have to make a snowball.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, pal.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
Patrick! How could you?,spongebob,1
"It's a snowball fight, remember?",not spongebob,0
Oh yeah.,spongebob,1
"Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!",spongebob,1
That's me!,not spongebob,0
"I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!",spongebob,1
"Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down.",spongebob,1
Huh?  Ha! You missed me!,not spongebob,0
Score one for the boys back home!,spongebob,1
"Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades.",not spongebob,0
"I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.",not spongebob,0
"Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?",not spongebob,0
Can I use your bathroom?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, go use your own bathroom.",not spongebob,0
I don't think I can make it! Please?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Please?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Please?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
Please!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, make it quick.",not spongebob,0
That's okay.,not spongebob,0
"Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh...",not spongebob,0
Yay! Squidward's on my side!,not spongebob,0
I most certainly am not!,not spongebob,0
Then that means he's on my side!,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!",not spongebob,0
I'm ready!,spongebob,1
Hmm...,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, it's out.",spongebob,1
"Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be  knocking each other's brains out!",not spongebob,0
"We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children.",spongebob,1
"No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.",spongebob,1
"Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
And who am I?,not spongebob,0
You're Patrick.,not spongebob,0
Can I be Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
"No! Wait, why?",not spongebob,0
He's a good leader.,spongebob,1
Would you butt out?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...",not spongebob,0
"If you're in this war, then where's your fort?",spongebob,1
"I don't have one, okay? Now...",not spongebob,0
"You got to have a fort, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Forts win wars, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Okay, fine! You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...",not spongebob,0
"Your fort's too small, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...",not spongebob,0
"He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.",spongebob,1
"Trust me, it's fine.",not spongebob,0
"See, it is too small.",spongebob,1
"Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly...",not spongebob,0
Exposed.,spongebob,1
Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!,not spongebob,0
Squidward returned fire!,spongebob,1
Then it's war!,not spongebob,0
"No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!  I was just giving a demonstration!  All right, that's it! You guys asked for it!  I got him! Ha! I got him!  In your face, SpongeBob!  This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!",not spongebob,0
"He got you good, SpongeBob!  Take cover!",not spongebob,0
"Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah...  Incoming!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.,not spongebob,0
Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B.,spongebob,1
"What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!  Take this, Patrick!  Taste my frozen fury!  Victory is mine!  Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now!",not spongebob,0
"Did you hear something, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Get out the snowshoes and the shovels.,not spongebob,0
Did you get stuck in the pet door again?,not spongebob,0
"I ain't gonna lie to you, Meredith, ,  I am not a happy camper!",not spongebob,0
"We'll be right back with The Giant Isopod Stuck in the Pet Door show, after these messages!",not spongebob,0
"Homes, homes, homes, homes, homes! I'm Nick Fishkins and I wanna buy your home!",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"You heard me, I wanna buy your home!",not spongebob,0
But my home's not for sale.,not spongebob,0
"It doesn't matter to me, any condition,  any size, I'll buy your home! Sold!",not spongebob,0
Sold? Where am I gonna live now?,not spongebob,0
"What's happening, Patrick, you going on a hike?",spongebob,1
It's a forever hike.,not spongebob,0
A forever hike?,spongebob,1
Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins.,not spongebob,0
Who's Nick Fishkins?,spongebob,1
He shows up on television and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it.  Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home.,not spongebob,0
"Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!",spongebob,1
Wow!,not spongebob,0
I'm Nick Fishkins and I wanna buy your home! Sold!,not spongebob,0
"Well, we might as well spend the night here. It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!",spongebob,1
Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat!,not spongebob,0
"Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually, I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively... happy!  ♪Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!♪",not spongebob,0
"Morning, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Good morning, SpongeBob!  Oh, that's why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?",not spongebob,0
Built a house.,spongebob,1
What the-- why?,not spongebob,0
Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.,not spongebob,0
So now we live here.,spongebob,1
"Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?",not spongebob,0
"Well, he hasn't paid us yet!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, he said it right on the TV, I wanna buy your home! But we haven't seen any money!",spongebob,1
"Ohhh... let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?",not spongebob,0
Really weird!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, listen you dumb--  Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that!",not spongebob,0
"Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy?  You look like you slept in a pile of trash!",not spongebob,0
A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!,spongebob,1
With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.,not spongebob,0
How much?,spongebob,1
Hmm... your paycheck oughtta cover it!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive.",spongebob,1

"That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?",spongebob,1

"Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks, Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.",spongebob,1
"Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on, buddy. I'll help you.  Okay, now, say it.  Say it.",not spongebob,0

"I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide.",spongebob,1
"What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!",not spongebob,0

Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.,spongebob,1
"That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.",not spongebob,0

"It's my new scheme, Karen. I get Krabs to believe I'm a genie, I break this bottle, and then he's gonna put me in another bottle.",not spongebob,0
I hope it's a baby bottle because you look adorable.,not spongebob,0
"No, Karen, you hope it's the secret formula bottle because then we'll rule the fast food world!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, keep messing with that old crab, and the only container you'll need is an urn.",not spongebob,0

"You silly genie, you. You know it doesn't work like that. I'm your master now, and you have to grant me three wishes.",spongebob,1
"What? For cryin' out loud. All right, what would you like?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing for me, thank you. That would be selfish. But I will make three wishes for my friends. Friendship is magical too.",spongebob,1
I'm gonna be sick.,not spongebob,0
"Ow, ow, ow, ow!",not spongebob,0
What do you want? It's my day off!,not spongebob,0

Good thing I spent that last summer in evil band camp.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, magic is real.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Master? I have an idea! How about your next friend is Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
My next friend is my best friend.,spongebob,1

"Well, sometimes I wish I had an extra head so that I'd have someone to talk to when you're at work.",not spongebob,0
Aww.,spongebob,1
"Pathetic. All right, your crummy wish is my command! Give me your hand, Jumbo. And the both of you, close your eyes.",not spongebob,0
Alakazam!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! My extra head! It's my wish come true! Oh, I'm gonna call you... Noggin.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hello, Noggin. Nice to meet you.",spongebob,1
"Noggin, say hello to SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he doesn't have to—",spongebob,1
"Noggin, you're embarrassing me. Say hello to SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"No, it's okay, Patrick.",spongebob,1

"And so this would be the third and last wish I have, and it's all for you.",spongebob,1
Alakazam!,not spongebob,0
"Child, can't you see I'm working here?  Take your toy and go play in the kitchen.",not spongebob,0
"But it's a real genie, and I—I saved the last wish for you.",spongebob,1
"Okay, stop your blubbering. I'll play along. I wish I had, um, $1,000.",not spongebob,0
Your wish is my command!  You greedy crook.,not spongebob,0
"I'd like to withdraw all my money, please.",not spongebob,0
"Well, blow me down. It is a real genie! If I possess that bottle, I'll get three more wishes!",not spongebob,0
"It's mine now! With three wishes, I could rule the music world!",not spongebob,0
What happened to you?,not spongebob,0
I don't wanna talk about it. I just want a new Noggin.,not spongebob,0
"Got it! Nyah, nyah, the genie's mine now!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, look, a penny!",spongebob,1
What? Money? Where? Ooh.,not spongebob,0
You hand me that bottle!,not spongebob,0
"No, Mr. Krabs! Oh, don't you all see? We shouldn't be fighting. Today we found out that magic is real. And that magic is magical and that magic makes you feel all sparkly and  carbonated inside.",spongebob,1
So how do we decide who gets the genie?,not spongebob,0
That's easy. We're gonna play a little game called Spin The Bottle!,spongebob,1
So the rules are whichever one the bottle points to...,spongebob,1
Has to kiss!,not spongebob,0

"All right, Alakazam, first thing I want is for everything in the Krusty Krab to turn into gold—even all the negative space.",not spongebob,0
I can't do it! I can't keep up this charade anymore. I'm too mangled and mutilated!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I should have known! What was your lame-o plan this time?",not spongebob,0
I was gonna break that bottle so you would have to put me in the bottle with the secret formula.,not spongebob,0
"So you were gonna break my bottle, eh? That's the last time I go on vacation and sublet my bottle to someone without references!  What did you do to it? It's all chipped and scratched!",not spongebob,0
"Calm down, you're insured.",not spongebob,0
Who's this clod with my bottle?,not spongebob,0
Who's that bottle with my clod?,not spongebob,0
Hmm...,not spongebob,0
"So you all like bottles, eh?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, poor baby. Next time I'll take you with me to visit Mama.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you guys, I—huh? Hmm, guess they worked it out. It's so heartwarming to live in a world with real magic. And the greatest magic of all is the way my friends are so close to each other.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, will you get us out of here?!",not spongebob,0
"Yuck, this bottle of ketchup's gone bad.",spongebob,1
"Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,",spongebob,1

"Well you see you got cold knees, icy joints, Siberian patellas? What you need is a pair of longpants!",not spongebob,0
"Longpants?  Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants.",spongebob,1
"Nonsense, no fellers you walk around with shiver shins!  Give yourself something to leg up  Join the trouser troupe!  Don't be a slacker, wear slacks!",not spongebob,0
Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay!  How do I look?,spongebob,1
"Excuse me, sir, I was just talking to a little baby schoolboy a second ago, about yay high and...  It's you! I didn't recognize you with your mature, grownup longpants!",not spongebob,0
"You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?",spongebob,1
"Hey, man!",not spongebob,0
He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees!,spongebob,1
Is that my daddy?,not spongebob,0
I wish!,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, excuse me, sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob!  There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.",not spongebob,0
"Yah, it must be the long pants!",spongebob,1
"So they are! You'll run the register today!  Into the galley with you, Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs? Why?",not spongebob,0
"Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none!",not spongebob,0
Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?,spongebob,1

What?!,not spongebob,0
What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?,spongebob,1
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright, alright, that's enough!  I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! You’re just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!",not spongebob,0
You should be the maitre'd! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!,not spongebob,0
"Okay!  How is that patty treating you, sir?",spongebob,1
You're an angel!,not spongebob,0
"No, merely a man, a man in longpants.  Oh, my precious longpants!",spongebob,1
"What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?",not spongebob,0
"Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre'd material.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place.",not spongebob,0
"As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on!",spongebob,1
Where's he going?,not spongebob,0
A place called... manhood.,not spongebob,0
"Doris, I insist!",not spongebob,0
Don't be silly!,not spongebob,0
"Allow me, ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing...",spongebob,1
What an inseam!,not spongebob,0
And those pleats were pretty easy on the eyes!,not spongebob,0
"AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour!",spongebob,1

"Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this!",spongebob,1
"I was gonna fail you, and send you to jail, but because of those longpants, and all the blood rushing to my head, you passed!",not spongebob,0
I finally got my drivers license!,spongebob,1
"Lock your doors, bar your windows, it's the end of the world!",not spongebob,0
"Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment!   Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae.",spongebob,1
Extraordinary. And may I add that those are very impressive breeches you are wearing.,not spongebob,0

"What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants!   Get off!  Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants!",spongebob,1
"What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?",spongebob,1

"You nice officers will protect me, right?",spongebob,1
"We ain't bodyguards, kid.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale.",not spongebob,0
Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!,spongebob,1
"I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'.  When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?",not spongebob,0
"This would be him, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"The Tattletale Strangler?!  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!",not spongebob,0
"Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.",spongebob,1

"Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?",spongebob,1
"Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby.",not spongebob,0
Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium.,spongebob,1
"Huh? Uhh, that's mine.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?",spongebob,1
"Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...",not spongebob,0
We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!,spongebob,1
"Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.",spongebob,1
"Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.",not spongebob,0
"Quick is my middle name.  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?",spongebob,1
Whatever gets us to your house quicker.,not spongebob,0
I'll take both!,spongebob,1
"Here you go, Mr. SquarePants.",not spongebob,0

"All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...",not spongebob,0
Protect me?,spongebob,1
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
"Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?",spongebob,1
Twenty minutes later...,not spongebob,0
"Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?",spongebob,1
"Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window.  I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?",not spongebob,0
"Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible.  Ya.",spongebob,1
Cleats?!  Get your feet out of my eye sockets!,not spongebob,0
"I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!",spongebob,1
Six hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside...",spongebob,1
Close the door...,not spongebob,0
"Well, here we are.",spongebob,1
I've finally got you all alone!,not spongebob,0
"I know, isn't it great?  Ooh.",spongebob,1

"Happy birthday, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
How did you guys know today is my birthday?,spongebob,1
We just do what the invitations say. Let's boogie some more!,not spongebob,0
Thanks for coming!  Alone again.,spongebob,1

Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?",not spongebob,0
Oh yeah.,spongebob,1
In that case...,not spongebob,0
"Great parties, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go.",not spongebob,0
Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.,spongebob,1
"Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.",not spongebob,0
"I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in!",not spongebob,0
"So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.",spongebob,1
He's not the Strangler!,not spongebob,0
He's not?,spongebob,1
I am!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's a fake, you idiot! I bought it at the party store!",not spongebob,0

I'm not safe! Come back!,spongebob,1
"Finally, away from that guy.",not spongebob,0

"Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard!  I'm the Strangler! See?!",not spongebob,0
The Strangler!,spongebob,1
"Good work, SpongeBob. You put the Strangler behind bars.",not spongebob,0
At least I'm safe from that yellow idiot.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mac,  what're you in for?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, kids! Patchy Pirate here on a glorious day. I'm going to deliver this here very special present to SpongeBob on his birthday. That is, if I can get this blasted boat to start.  And start!",not spongebob,0
Maybe if you remembered to fill the tank with gas...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Potty, you're full of gas! Get outta here!",not spongebob,0

"Hey, what's the big idea?",not spongebob,0
"It's part of the plan, idiot! I jump from your shorts into SpongeBob's pocket to get his keys? Remember?",not spongebob,0

"Well, since SpongeBob works for me, I know he'd like  a Krusty Krab theme!",not spongebob,0
"Working for you means he's a masochist. So, a torture theme is the way to go.  Ow!",not spongebob,0
A driving theme is what SpongeBob would love.,not spongebob,0
Hmm. Unleaded.,not spongebob,0
You're all lame! The theme has got to be Mermaid Man or nada.,not spongebob,0
I'm obviously his idol. A theme based on me is the only —,not spongebob,0

"So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora &amp; fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?",not spongebob,0
"Well yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that,  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, Shelly Super Highway, from ever being built!",spongebob,1
"1,397, 1,398--  Whoa!",not spongebob,0
"Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!",spongebob,1
"Can't right now, bro. I got about 4,098 more reps to do.",not spongebob,0
"Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway!  Hmmm.",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.",not spongebob,0
Too busy doing what?,spongebob,1
"I'm too busy telling you, No!",not spongebob,0
Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!,not spongebob,0
"Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.",spongebob,1
"Why SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute.",not spongebob,0
I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields.,spongebob,1
"Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?",not spongebob,0
"Really, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Sure, why not?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!",spongebob,1
"Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, why?",spongebob,1
"Uh well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.",not spongebob,0
Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see for yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!,not spongebob,0
Charts and dia- Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?,spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"This.  According to these plans. After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Look, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it goes through a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!",spongebob,1
What!? Who approved this plan!?,not spongebob,0
"Plan approved by &amp; sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!",spongebob,1
"C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!",not spongebob,0
Think this piece will get the point across?,spongebob,1
"Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!",not spongebob,0
I can't.,not spongebob,0
"C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!",not spongebob,0
I really can't come outside!,not spongebob,0
Why not!?,spongebob,1
"Because I'm already out here, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes, for cryin' out loud!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, right.",not spongebob,0
"Now what's this all about, anyway?",not spongebob,0
"Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.",not spongebob,0
"All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.",not spongebob,0
Not that!,spongebob,1
What? You've been what?,not spongebob,0
"We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.",spongebob,1
Wait a minute. You've been what?,not spongebob,0
"Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
I don't know.,not spongebob,0
"Forget it. Even if I wanted to stop the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.",not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
"Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.",not spongebob,0
"Order. Order. Order in the Meeting Hall.  Now all those in favor of paving over Jellyfish Fields and building the Shelly Superhighway, raise your right fin and say aye.",not spongebob,0
Aye!,not spongebob,0
"Now everyone else, just sit there, quietly.",not spongebob,0
I like highways.,not spongebob,0
I like things that are super.,not spongebob,0
"And I like saying, aye.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, why did I say aye?",not spongebob,0
"Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!",not spongebob,0
"What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.",not spongebob,0
"Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!",spongebob,1

So what did you say this house is made from again?,spongebob,1
Guano.,not spongebob,0
Great.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon.",spongebob,1
"Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. The only way back is to surf there.,not spongebob,0
O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom?  Aaaaahhhhhh!  I don't know how to surf!,spongebob,1
"Whoa, chill out, little dude. We can teach you.",not spongebob,0
Cool!,spongebob,1
"Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.",not spongebob,0
Others...,not spongebob,0
"... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.",not spongebob,0
"And sometimes, it's the retreat.",not spongebob,0
"Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast...",not spongebob,0

What's that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it.",not spongebob,0
What's he saying?,spongebob,1
He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.,not spongebob,0
Who?,spongebob,1
"His name  is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.",not spongebob,0
Amen.,not spongebob,0
"We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.",not spongebob,0
Will there be nachos there?,not spongebob,0
"Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch.",spongebob,1
No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.,not spongebob,0
How far up stream did you say it was?,spongebob,1
"Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.",not spongebob,0
We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, interpret that any way you want.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!",not spongebob,0
Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.,spongebob,1
Again?!,not spongebob,0

"Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here.",spongebob,1
You've never even seen him!,not spongebob,0
You've got to stop judging people by the way they look.,spongebob,1
You're right.,not spongebob,0
Look!,not spongebob,0
It's him!,spongebob,1
"Oh, my-",not spongebob,0
It's JKL!  Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.,spongebob,1
"Plus, we wanna talk to you.",not spongebob,0
"Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home?",spongebob,1
Uh...,not spongebob,0
"Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?",not spongebob,0
I kinda like staring at him.,not spongebob,0
"I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.,not spongebob,0
That... was your first lesson.,not spongebob,0
What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!,not spongebob,0
Just keep breathing.,not spongebob,0
"Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!,not spongebob,0
Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the convenience store? You even spilled me milk!,not spongebob,0
"Well, there ain't no use crying over it.  Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!",not spongebob,0
"Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wonderful.",not spongebob,0
"Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.",spongebob,1
Just... keep breathing.,not spongebob,0
That's it?! I just wanna go home!,not spongebob,0
Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?,spongebob,1
"Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?",not spongebob,0
Yup.,spongebob,1
And?,not spongebob,0
"He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.",spongebob,1
We're gonna be stuck here forever!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back.  Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.",not spongebob,0
"Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!",not spongebob,0
"Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, and I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.",not spongebob,0
"No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.",not spongebob,0
Okay...,not spongebob,0
"All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...",not spongebob,0
You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.,not spongebob,0
Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers.,not spongebob,0
Where's he going?! Come on!,spongebob,1
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!,spongebob,1
Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!,not spongebob,0
JKL! Is this the next part of our training?,spongebob,1
Uh...,not spongebob,0
These clouds. They can only mean one thing.,not spongebob,0
Increased chance of precipitation?,not spongebob,0
"Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.",not spongebob,0
A perfect wave?,spongebob,1
"The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's what they used to call me!",not spongebob,0
"It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. You'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever.  The Big One is almost upon us.",not spongebob,0
"Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!",not spongebob,0
Ya promise?,not spongebob,0

What's going on? What could it mean?,spongebob,1
"Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine!  And hiding behind it, who do we see? None other than Squidward and his bad face acne.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?,not spongebob,0
"A miracle, a marvel! It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace!",not spongebob,0
"But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?",not spongebob,0
I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face.,not spongebob,0
"I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime.",not spongebob,0
Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, Get lost!",not spongebob,0
"The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit. But SpongeBob didn't like it. No, not one bit. Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door.",not spongebob,0
I challenge your gadget! I declare patty war!,spongebob,1
"With three little words, Krabs started the show. Flag raised in the air, he cried...",not spongebob,0
"Ready, set, go!",not spongebob,0
"Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh so quite clever. SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed.  The crowd was impressed.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
"They cheered full of glee! All except Patrick, who had to go pee.",not spongebob,0
"A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam. The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out...",not spongebob,0
I won't be defeated!,spongebob,1
"He took in some air. SpongeBob swelled his physique. Then dozens of patties filled up his cheeks.  He strained and he sweated. He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill!",not spongebob,0
Not bad!,not spongebob,0
Yelled out Squidward.,not spongebob,0
A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high!,not spongebob,0
"The gizmo, it shuddered, it clattered, it shook! And as Squidward laughed:",not spongebob,0
Ha-ha!,not spongebob,0
Sandy said...,not spongebob,0
What a schnook!,not spongebob,0
But SpongeBob cried out...,not spongebob,0
I won't lose to that thing!,spongebob,1
"Then he raised up two spatulas and leapt like a spring. His hands were a blur, the patties went flying. He fried up a hundred without even trying. Squidward was worried, SpongeBob couldn't be beat!",not spongebob,0
"I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat!",not spongebob,0
"He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue. Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two! The gadget buckled and sparked, it cracked like a gun. So Squidward took off, yelling...",not spongebob,0
Let me know if I've won!,not spongebob,0
"Lightning flew from its maw, it looked ready to burst. But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled...",not spongebob,0
"Foul beast, do your worst!",spongebob,1
"The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see! Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster. He proved to that thing that he was its master!  The gadget blew into bits and died with a boom. The blast was so loud, it woke King Neptune!",not spongebob,0
What was that?,not spongebob,0
"It was all over, finished and done. With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won. The crowd yelled, Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud! But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud.  The service was short, tears shed with regret. Squidward, it seemed, was the one most upset.",not spongebob,0
Whoo! Yeah!,spongebob,1
"What's that? You thought SpongeBob was buried down there? They just buried the gadget! Ha-ha! This I swear!  Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book. Now I gotta go and polish me hook!",not spongebob,0
Ooh-wah!  Oh!,spongebob,1
Hmm? Who's that?,not spongebob,0
"Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?",spongebob,1
"Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr.-  what?",spongebob,1
Fired?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you see, I've been doing some calculating and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.",not spongebob,0
Bu-bu-bu-but how about if I work for free?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's  illegal. And I'll lose my vendor's license. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, excuse me. Is that mine?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. Maybe.  Take it.,spongebob,1
You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.,not spongebob,0

"Oh, yeah.",not spongebob,0
"Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned.  Here's your pink slip.  I'm giving you the ax.  You're fired.",not spongebob,0
"No, not that, anything but that!",spongebob,1
"So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that.",not spongebob,0
"Here, I'll get that for you.",spongebob,1
I'll also need the hat. Allow me.  Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need.,not spongebob,0
I'm not a very strong swimmer.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, that's enough. It's closing time.  You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime...  As a customer.  Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance.  Man, is it going to be sweet without that pest around!  This day couldn't get any better.  Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times golden spatula in the navy,  so I'll be running the grill.  Ooh!",not spongebob,0
I can smell the grease fires already.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Gary, I'm home. Forever.",spongebob,1

"Here you go, little buddy.  Ahh. Mmm!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you're a mess. You're falling apart.  Come on now, SpongeBob. You need to pull yourself together. Get some structure in your life.  What you need is a new job.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.",spongebob,1

Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that!,not spongebob,0

We heard you complaining about the fingerprints.,not spongebob,0
And the foot tapping.,not spongebob,0
And my loose change.,not spongebob,0
And my teeth!  And his hat!,not spongebob,0
And you called your pipe stupid.,not spongebob,0
And the fact that you said you were the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom!,not spongebob,0
"I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! Oh, would you just...  Let me down, you goons!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Tentacles. Throw him in, fellas.",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Wait! It is I who makes Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead.,spongebob,1
Works for me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm glad that y'all came to your senses. Bunch of ingrates. Come on, SpongeBob. Jump in.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, help!",not spongebob,0
"I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!",spongebob,1
"I take it back!  Please SpongeBob, I didn't mean any of that! I do appreciate your friendship. I am grateful. I'm... I'm...  I'm grateful for the life I'm living! Who knows how long I'll have it? I learned that from you, remember? Goodbye, everyone!  Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I always knew you felt that way.  Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us.",spongebob,1
My house!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, now the volcano is appeaved!",not spongebob,0
But I thought you said a sacrifice had to be made of the most miserable person.,not spongebob,0
"No! You didn't let me finish. I was trying to say, a sacrifice of the most miserable person's house. No one ever listens to me.",not spongebob,0
"You know SpongeBob, in light of everything that just happened... I lied to you. I am not grateful for anything! I mean look at me. I don't even have a roof to sleep under, anymore!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I wouldn't say that.",spongebob,1
Go away.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, Goo Lagoon. Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool.",not spongebob,0
What a beautiful day.,spongebob,1
"You said it, pal.",not spongebob,0
Can you believe that sun?,spongebob,1
I could look at it all day.,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Nothing.,spongebob,1
"So, how's that tan coming?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?,spongebob,1
Just a minute.  I could have sworn I was laying on my back.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?",not spongebob,0
Sure. Don't scratch the paint.,not spongebob,0
"Lifeguard, how’s the tubage?",not spongebob,0
"Gnarly, dudes!",not spongebob,0
"All right, yeah! Woohoo!",not spongebob,0
"Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?",not spongebob,0
Right over there! But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.,not spongebob,0
So polite.,not spongebob,0
Just like we raised him.,not spongebob,0
What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool!,spongebob,1
"Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!",not spongebob,0
"Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here.",not spongebob,0
I'm going to the snack bar.,not spongebob,0
"Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  And live!",spongebob,1
"Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers!  SpongeBob, you okay?  Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.",not spongebob,0
Lifeguard?,spongebob,1
The nose?,not spongebob,0
White stuff! You think I'm a lifeguard?,spongebob,1
"Sure! There’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.",not spongebob,0
You really think so?,spongebob,1
"You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?",not spongebob,0
I'd love it!,spongebob,1
"Alright.  Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here!  I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Hi.,spongebob,1
"Hey, guy's a lifeguard.",not spongebob,0
"It works!  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry!",spongebob,1
"Yeah! Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?",not spongebob,0
By myself?,spongebob,1
Only if you think you're ready.,not spongebob,0
"I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddy.",spongebob,1
"It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...",not spongebob,0
"Help, help!  Help, help, help!",not spongebob,0
"We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.",not spongebob,0
Action?,spongebob,1
"Please help, please help!",not spongebob,0
"Breathe, darn you!",not spongebob,0
That's the last time I read and swim! You saved my life!,not spongebob,0
"Don't mention it. It's all part of the job.  You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people...  ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about.  Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth.  See ya.",not spongebob,0
"But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes!  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!  Uhh... there are sharks in there!",spongebob,1
"Hey, that's my family you're talking about!",not spongebob,0
Uhh... sea monster!,spongebob,1
"You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, somebody went?  No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.  But just so you're not tempted...  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed.",spongebob,1
We like Larry better!,not spongebob,0
Does Larry ever give you  free ice cream?,spongebob,1
Ice cream!  Did somebody say  ice cream?  Where is it? Is it here?  Huh? Ice cream! Yay!  Cramp! Ah! Ah!,not spongebob,0
Holy cow! Somebody's drowning!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed.",spongebob,1
"Dude, get your butt in the water!",not spongebob,0
"If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.",spongebob,1
"Help, help!  I can't swim!",not spongebob,0
Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.,spongebob,1
I'm drowning! I'm drowning!,not spongebob,0
They would have to have crossed the line.,spongebob,1
I'm drowning ‘cause I crossed the line!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that...  ...Patrick isn't drowning!",spongebob,1
Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on, Patrick!  I'm coming!",spongebob,1
"Help, help!",not spongebob,0
Don't move!  Catch this!,spongebob,1
"Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.",not spongebob,0
"Help, help!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think.  Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think.  I've got it!  Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water!  Well, you're safe now, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now it’s dark!  Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help!",not spongebob,0
To us.,not spongebob,0
"Sorry! Here's your hot dog.  Okay, Patrick, here I come!  Come, come round, Pat. Here I am.",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry.",not spongebob,0
Help! Help us! We're drowning!,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Goodbye, ice cream!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Larry?",spongebob,1
"You're not a lifeguard, are you?",not spongebob,0
"No, Larry.",spongebob,1
"Let's go, guys.  Very good. You fellas are learning fast.",not spongebob,0
Ow! Butt cramps!,not spongebob,0
And I still don't have my ice cream.,not spongebob,0
Neptune's stirred up quite a gale tonight. He must be mad about something.,not spongebob,0
Ha! Hahahaha! That's silly. Everyone knows Poseidon is ruler of the undersea.  Oh. My leftovers.,not spongebob,0
"Nooo!  Why, dear Neptune?",not spongebob,0
"Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles!",spongebob,1
My shift's over.,not spongebob,0
"Time for work, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Jelly, out you go.  It's been real fun, but I gotta get to work.  Quite a wind this morning, eh, Jelly?  Whoa!  Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I don't have time to play right now?  Hahaha! No, please! Stop it! Please stop!  Whoa!  Oh! I'm going to be late!  I told you guys, I don't have time to play!  I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook, and I'm not going to start today!",spongebob,1
Hahaha!,not spongebob,0
I need to call in some help.  My fingers are too big for the buttons.,spongebob,1
"Hello, this be the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! I need you!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Where you been? Customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!  and lands on his face, then gets in line]",not spongebob,0
"I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!",spongebob,1
Jellyfish?,not spongebob,0
They're attracted to my whistley holes.,spongebob,1
"Uh, I'll never understand what you just said. But if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing.  Gotcha! Hmm? Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight.  It's fightin' too hard!  If you're gonna reel him in, Krabs, you gotta wear him down. Give him a little slack,  then yank!  Give a little slack, then yank!  There he is. Ready for work.  Draw back the point, now get in there and start pushing out them patties.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, sir.  Let's get these patties started right! Wooooh! That gives me an idea.",spongebob,1
"Order up! *humming* Ooh, hoohoo!  Oh no. They've found me.  No, no, no, guys, please! Uh, would you mind coming back after business hours? Heh, I'm trying to work here.",spongebob,1
The weather situation is much worse across the country.,not spongebob,0
And this doesn't look like the winds are going to stop any time soon.,not spongebob,0
Ha ha ha ha. Fishy go bye-bye.,not spongebob,0
And that's the way it is in your world today.,not spongebob,0
Boring! I don't want to watch any of this boring stuff. I wanna watch something decent like--,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick. I need a place to hide from those jellyfish.",spongebob,1
What jellyfish?,not spongebob,0
"Ever since the wind started, a sound whistles through my holes that the jellyfish seem to love.",spongebob,1
"Hey, pal.  Owww!  SpongeBob, get out of here!  I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but you've become a negative influence!",not spongebob,0
"Hahahaha! At least the wind stopped.  I think I lost them. Well, I guess I should just stay here where it's safe... and quiet... and dark. It's okay. I'll only hide out here here for a second. Yeah, it shouldn't take long. Behind these rocks. These sedentary, lifeless rocks.",spongebob,1
Later...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy. Just thought I'd spruce you up a little. Auh-what's that? Oh, you don't say. Well, guess what. You're my best friend too. Mmm-hmmm. Come on, let's have some fun. Look buddy, mmmmmmmmm. Dinner's ready. Here, let's have some tea. Want some sugar, buddy? Hmm? One lump or two? Oh, you can have it all.  I feel comfortable around you.  Can I confess something? Cause I know you'll understand. I have this problem. I seem to attract jellyfish! Hahahaha! How do handel a thing like that, Hmmmmm?  Yeah, yeah. I'm in a loss, too. Oh, barnacles. I'm gonna be stuck in this cave forever!  Of course, buddy. Brilliant idea!  We'll see what happens this time.  Whoooaaa, here they come! Go get 'em, buddy!  Hey, guys. Long time no see. Uh, what do you think about my little friend's song?  ...Something wrong?  Hmmmmm. I created one stone SpongeBob that uttered a note in a foul key. But if I were to craft another in a different size,  the dimensions of that hollow center, multiplied by the number of holes, may offer another tune. One that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Eh. I guess I'll just have to make a bunch of them.  Okay, that should do 'er.  Woah. It actually worked. Ah, they're finally leaving me alone. I can go back to work now!  Krusty Krab, here I come!  How long was I gone?!  No! No! No!",spongebob,1
"3,000 years later...",not spongebob,0
"To this day, no one knows why these mysterious statues were created or by whom.  All we know is that the genius of their design has caused the annual migration of jellyfish to their wondrous tune.",not spongebob,0
"♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...♪  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!",spongebob,1
Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call.,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Mr. K.  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!",spongebob,1
"Code blue?!  What's the matter, boy?",not spongebob,0
I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life!,spongebob,1
Man alive!  He's taking us down!,not spongebob,0
"Get ready, Krabs,  for the surprise of your life!",not spongebob,0
"Brace yourself!  Huh?  Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition.  What is that?",not spongebob,0
"Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom! Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum!  I vow to introduce to this fair city culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling!  I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict!  My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free!  Come on! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.",not spongebob,0
"Wow! Real-life conflict, for free?",not spongebob,0
Let the horror show begin!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, my resisters are simply gushing from their copper foil traces.",not spongebob,0
This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!,not spongebob,0
That's what you said when you tried to boil Krabs in a giant bisque.,not spongebob,0
"I can still feel the burns... which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife!  Uh, sorry, honey.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!",spongebob,1
"I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!  Where's all me loyal customers?!",not spongebob,0
They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.,not spongebob,0
"That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave...",not spongebob,0
I'm right here!,not spongebob,0
"...but when he steals me customers, then I push back! Gentlemen, to the coliseum!  This reeks of evil. And I'm going to sniff out the source.",not spongebob,0
"Welcome, one and all, to the first biannual big arena of annihilation!",not spongebob,0
Whoo!,spongebob,1
"Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin!",not spongebob,0
All right!,not spongebob,0
"Yay!  Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go up against that beast!",spongebob,1
"You call this fun? This is just cheap, uncultured lay sport.",not spongebob,0
"Now, release the opponent!",not spongebob,0
Yes! Go!  Patrick?! How could they?! This is horrible!,spongebob,1
This is fabulous!,not spongebob,0
Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages!,not spongebob,0
All right!,not spongebob,0
"That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!",not spongebob,0
Rip his sausages off!,not spongebob,0
"Ohh. Nice kitty.  Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty... sausage.  Spawn of a gefilte fish!",not spongebob,0
I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there!  Patrick!,spongebob,1
"What? Oh! Oh, it's you! Hey, how's it going, buddy?",not spongebob,0
"No time for chitchat, get in!  Hurry up, Nelly!",spongebob,1
Boo!,not spongebob,0
Boring!  I want to see some body parts!,not spongebob,0
Mom!,not spongebob,0
"This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2!  Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you, miss?",not spongebob,0
"Well, all this waiting around for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry.",not spongebob,0
"Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.",not spongebob,0
"Why, thank you.",not spongebob,0
"Just ten dollars, please.",not spongebob,0
"Ten dollars?! Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?",not spongebob,0
Exactly!,not spongebob,0
"You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?",not spongebob,0
"No, I suppose not.",not spongebob,0
"Ten dollars, or the fight's off!",not spongebob,0
"Ah, fine! Whatever.",not spongebob,0
Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you already.,not spongebob,0
That was appalling! What was in that?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, barnacles! That's foul!",not spongebob,0
"Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees every day! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's boring, or the food's inedible. So sit down, enjoy the show, and buy some chum!",not spongebob,0
"What do we do now, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, I'm already doing it.",not spongebob,0
"NO!  Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh?  That's it, Patrick! He's not chasing us. He's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck!",spongebob,1
"Chum on a stick! Get your chum!  What the?  Oh, great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses?  Hey, watch where you're...  Oh, dear!  Phew. Good thing I thought ahead with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline!  No! Nice kitty! Want some chum?",not spongebob,0
"You know, I'm not one to give out comments lightly. I've gotta hand it to you, boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!",not spongebob,0
"My pleasure, Captain!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, thanks, buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke!",not spongebob,0
"I think that it's safe to say that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty of me good customers.",not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
"But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.",not spongebob,0
Ten dollars? What happened to one dollar?,not spongebob,0
"Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert.",not spongebob,0
Stupid inflation.,not spongebob,0
Thanks for your business.,not spongebob,0
"What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe.  Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.,not spongebob,0
Hello.,not spongebob,0
One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.,not spongebob,0
Goodbye.,not spongebob,0
I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.,not spongebob,0
Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm going to be a spy.",spongebob,1
"You're a spy?!  I wanna be a spy, too!",not spongebob,0
"Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.",not spongebob,0
Hooray! We're spy buddies!!,not spongebob,0
Spy buddies.,not spongebob,0
"Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
In my hands?  Ooh...,spongebob,1
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"Your mission - if you choose to accept it - is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds.",not spongebob,0
"Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick!",spongebob,1
That's gonna leave a mark.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?",not spongebob,0
"Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?",spongebob,1
"Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets, like jet-packs, and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies...",not spongebob,0
"10-4, good buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses.  And my favorite, the knockout ray.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies!",spongebob,1
I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff!,not spongebob,0
"What do we do now, Patrick?",spongebob,1
What's he doing now?,not spongebob,0
Nothing yet. Wait! Wait!! He's...  ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.,spongebob,1
Excuse me?!  Do you have anything in a size negative five?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, bud, that's as small as they come.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes?",spongebob,1
How embarrassing?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.,spongebob,1
Krabs here. Go ahead.,not spongebob,0
Plankton just bought some baby clothes.,spongebob,1
Baby clothes?  Hmm... What's he doing now?,not spongebob,0
Hold on.  He's buying...,spongebob,1
Yeah? Yeah?,not spongebob,0
A... stamp.,spongebob,1
"A stamp.  This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"We're right behind him, and he has no idea!",spongebob,1
"Grrrr, would you stop making all that racket!?",not spongebob,0
What's he doing now?,not spongebob,0
I can't tell.,spongebob,1
"Whew! Gosh, it's hot.  Yahhhh!!!",not spongebob,0
"He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-pack!",spongebob,1
Can do!,not spongebob,0
Whew... huh?,not spongebob,0
"Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!",spongebob,1
To the spy mobile!!,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...",spongebob,1
Self destruct!  There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.,not spongebob,0
Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
It's for you.,not spongebob,0
Agent SpongeBob here.,spongebob,1
You found out what Plankton's up to?,not spongebob,0
"I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, find him, lad; I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Exactly. So get to work.,not spongebob,0
"If you'd like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?",spongebob,1
I think the front door's open.,not spongebob,0
"Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.",spongebob,1
This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants!,not spongebob,0
"Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn!  I thought you were holding the rope --",spongebob,1
I am! You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission!,not spongebob,0
"Secret mission, eh?!  Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer!  I'll let you two look over the menu.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I have to go.",not spongebob,0
"Ohhh, can't you go later?",spongebob,1
My laser pants aren't working right.,not spongebob,0
Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, no thanks...",not spongebob,0
Or perhaps a bran muffin?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! I have to go now!!,not spongebob,0
"Prune Danish?  What the--?!  Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get!",not spongebob,0
Why's it dark? I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.,not spongebob,0
"No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.",not spongebob,0
Merciful Neptune!  Man your battle stations!,not spongebob,0
I'm on it!,not spongebob,0
"Bring it on, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I will! We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song.",not spongebob,0
"He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly?  You can have 'em!",not spongebob,0
"Do your worst, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
I hate my job.,not spongebob,0
"It's up to you and me, buddy!",spongebob,1
Abandon ship!  NOOO! AAHHH!,not spongebob,0
Pointy-headed projectile on the port side!,not spongebob,0
Heh-heh-heh! Huh?  NOO!!!,not spongebob,0
I win! I ALWAYS WIN!,not spongebob,0
"Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, I always...",not spongebob,0
...win!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?!,spongebob,1
That's right!  I stole me own formuler!,not spongebob,0
"But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's...  Mr. Krabs is a robot!",spongebob,1
"No, you idiot.",not spongebob,0
Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here!?,spongebob,1

"I almost had it thirty-seven times, and you know it!",not spongebob,0
"Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet.  You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!",not spongebob,0
You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.",not spongebob,0
Ha! The usual wager?,not spongebob,0
"You're on.  So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game...  and destroyed his place of business!  Now pay up.",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Eugene.  One a-dollar.",not spongebob,0
Not so fast!,not spongebob,0
Squidward!  Then-then who are you!?,spongebob,1

In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.",spongebob,1
Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.,not spongebob,0
Who's that?,spongebob,1
"Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.",not spongebob,0
♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪,spongebob,1
"Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable.",not spongebob,0
Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?,spongebob,1
Paycheck! You got a deal--,not spongebob,0
And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?,spongebob,1
You've got a deal.,not spongebob,0
And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!,spongebob,1

"That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?",not spongebob,0
I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week.,not spongebob,0
That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?,not spongebob,0

"Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.",not spongebob,0
"You really think so, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1

Ahh...  What the—!?  Barnacles!,not spongebob,0
"How do you like that, baby?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. Well, what do ya think about this, baby?",spongebob,1
Question. Are you two acting even more infantile than usual this morning?,not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh. ‘Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes  me back.",spongebob,1
"Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby.",not spongebob,0
"Babies don't talk like that, Patrick. They talk like...",spongebob,1
"Just as the essential oils were kicking in.  Hey! I'd appreciate some quiet!  How dare you scoot away from me, I'm scolding here!  Would you two for once, act your age?!  Fine! Act like infants your whole life! See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down!",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, he's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. He should probably see a doctor. Come on, let's take him to the hospital.",spongebob,1
"Hang in there, buddy. We'll have you fixed up in no time.",not spongebob,0
Hmmm?,not spongebob,0
"So what's the prognosis, doctor?",spongebob,1
"Your friend has a condition known by the medical term of Head-go-boom-boom-itis. Not to worry, though, he should recover over normally over time, but he mustn't receive any more blows to the head or he may remain this way permanently. Just care for him as if he were your very own bouncy baby boy and he'll be fine.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, little Squidward. Ready to have some fun? Woop-ee-doo!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squiddy! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle?  Patrick, how could you!  There, there! My little darling. We're supposed to protect his head, remember?  Okay, Squiddy! I made your favorite. Krill tartare with an algae vinaigrette.  Here it comes, open wide!  Come on, little buddy, you got eat healthy so you can grow up to be big and cranky. Just watch the airplane land in the hangar.  See, Patrick, sometimes you have to out-think the baby.  You know, Patrick, maybe we...",spongebob,1
"Ahh, thanks for sharing, baby",not spongebob,0
"Okay. Time to lighten things up. Do you like games, Squiddy?",spongebob,1
Games? Games is our middle name!,not spongebob,0
"You like that, Squiddy?",spongebob,1
He does.,not spongebob,0
"Ohh, this game's kinda dangerous.",spongebob,1
Squiddy!  Squiddy. No!,not spongebob,0
Don't worry. I got this.,not spongebob,0
"Hooray!  Squidward!  Squiddy, are you okay?  We need to do a better job of protecting him.",spongebob,1
"There, there now, no need to cry.",spongebob,1

"SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties.  The poor guy has the mind of an infant.",spongebob,1
I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money.,not spongebob,0
But...,spongebob,1
"No buts! Get to work, you two!",not spongebob,0
"All settled into your work station, I see. Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all! Now let's make it official!  Oh, how silly of me!  Squiddy needs a high chair!  And duct tape!  Oh, Squiddy! I'm so proud of you! Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me! And look at you now, working and sitting in a big boy seat!",spongebob,1
"All right! That's enough, you two. Time to serve some customers!",not spongebob,0
"Remember, buddy! I'll be right behind you!",spongebob,1
"Can I get a Krabby Patty and a large kelp shake, please?  Okay, how much do I owe ya?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! That's not for eating!  There we are. Good as neww-!  That's not for eating either!  Sorry, sir.",spongebob,1
"Hop to it, boys. We haven't even taken our first order!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs.  You know what to do.  Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on, huh...  Will this be for here or to go?  We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy.",spongebob,1
"My face! My face! Also my leg, but mostly my face!",not spongebob,0
Hey! Are you going to take an order or what?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!",spongebob,1
"Listen, man! I'm done playing these baby games!  Oh, my Neptune!",not spongebob,0
What is that? What is it?,not spongebob,0
What in blazes is going on around he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward!  Where are your manners?,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, watch his head!",spongebob,1

"Sorry!  Okay, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!",spongebob,1
"Are you out of your ever-living mind?! We can't change that baby out here in front of the customers! Take him in back where the food is prepared.  Oh, that's it! Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, if my poopy baby isn't welcome here, then I'm not staying either!  Squidward!",spongebob,1
What the? Where am I? What's going on?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, you're back to your normal grown-up self.",spongebob,1
Of course I'm grown-up! Why wouldn't I be?  Am I wearing a diaper?,not spongebob,0
Yes.,spongebob,1
Is it full?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward, I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra...",spongebob,1
Stop! Not another word about this. Ever!,not spongebob,0
"Kids, they grow up so fast.",spongebob,1
"Squidward, we love you!",not spongebob,0
"I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite!",not spongebob,0
"Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous.  Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?",spongebob,1
"I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.",not spongebob,0
"See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?",spongebob,1
"Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, that sounds fancy.",spongebob,1
Let me show you how it works.,not spongebob,0
Whoa!  Where'd it go?,spongebob,1
Just where you think it would be.,not spongebob,0
Oh!,not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
"I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,spongebob,1
Hold on tight.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...",spongebob,1
"Well, here we go again.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward!",spongebob,1
What's going on with this thing?  What in tarnation?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy!",spongebob,1
"I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, me too.",spongebob,1
"Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.",spongebob,1
"Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I wish I knew how.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him!",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.",not spongebob,0
"Well, here goes nothing.",not spongebob,0
"All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy?",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.",not spongebob,0
May I see my baby?,not spongebob,0
Of course.,not spongebob,0
"I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you.  Hey, baby, what's your name?",not spongebob,0
"It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.",not spongebob,0
Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.,not spongebob,0
"I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.",not spongebob,0
Together forever.,spongebob,1

If you say so.,not spongebob,0
"Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, cap'n!",spongebob,1
Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.",spongebob,1
I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register.  Whew. Can I help you?,not spongebob,0
"Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  I can't... reach the buns.,spongebob,1

"Time is money, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Time is money. Right.  Hello, bun. At last we meet.",spongebob,1

"Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.",spongebob,1
"That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!",not spongebob,0
Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.,not spongebob,0

"What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak!  Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!",not spongebob,0
"Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on.",not spongebob,0
"Of course.  Oh, my.  Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!",spongebob,1
Superstar?,not spongebob,0
Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!,spongebob,1
You're right! The show must go on!,not spongebob,0

"Wow, they really liked it.",spongebob,1
"There you go, Squiddy!",not spongebob,0
"They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it  sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.",not spongebob,0
Sandy?,not spongebob,0
One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good.,not spongebob,0
Hmph.,not spongebob,0
I think I'm going to be sick!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, I'm out of here!",not spongebob,0
"Huh, no, wait. Wait!  Oh, my one moment of fame... gone.  There's got to be some way to reverse this.",not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I wouldn't--!",spongebob,1
"So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?",not spongebob,0
It all started when I was born.,not spongebob,0
"My, what a beautiful day it is outside.  Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"Who are you talking to, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Just like I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.,not spongebob,0
"Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse.",spongebob,1
Worse? How?,not spongebob,0
"Well, uh...",spongebob,1
Uh...you could be sick.,spongebob,1
Sick? Is that really any worse?,not spongebob,0
"Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. But that's not even the worst part.",spongebob,1
"Oh, really.",not spongebob,0
No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
Squidward? Squidward? Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well.",not spongebob,0
What's the matter?,spongebob,1
"Well, Uh. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh,  dry mouth, and my, um, uh, my eyes are itchy.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, what could it be?",spongebob,1
I'm not sure. But I fear I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.,not spongebob,0
Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?,spongebob,1
"Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, squeer, uh, squid's disease.",not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Squid's disease.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Squid's disease!,not spongebob,0
Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob? SpongeBob.  What are you doing back there?,not spongebob,0
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to  go home and not come back until you're fully recovered.",spongebob,1
"Well, SpongeBob,  I think you're probably right.",not spongebob,0
"I'm so sorry, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
You're sick?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do.  You know what. I better give you the old navy onceover just to be sure.",not spongebob,0
The what?,not spongebob,0
Now open wide.,not spongebob,0
"Tongue looks fine.  Eyes, check.",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
Forehead feels normal.  Now let's see those kneecaps.  Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.,not spongebob,0
Wonderful.,not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs...",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs nothing.,not spongebob,0
But I...,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs nothing!,not spongebob,0
But...,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it.,not spongebob,0
"And what about the customers? You don't want them to get sick, do you?",not spongebob,0
"No. And I don't want them to get hungry either.  So step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, puh-lease?",not spongebob,0
"Right away, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob.  Turn around, please.",not spongebob,0
Yes.,spongebob,1
And just what is that supposed to be?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this. It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink...",spongebob,1
Not that. Not that. The thing on your face.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this.",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Could I see that?,not spongebob,0
"Um, actually no.",spongebob,1
Because I find this all so very inte...  ...resting.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!",not spongebob,0
Mis...ter...Krabs!,spongebob,1
That's better. Now what can I do you for?,not spongebob,0
It's Squidward. He's sick.,spongebob,1
That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.,not spongebob,0
Who was the first?,spongebob,1
"Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marmalade Mountain.  Doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!",spongebob,1
"One Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Squidward, got a minute?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.",not spongebob,0
We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.,not spongebob,0
"He can't cook in this condition. No cookin, no patties. No patties, no money.",not spongebob,0
"And you're telling me this, why?",not spongebob,0
I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.,not spongebob,0
"So, you're telling me to go home?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!",not spongebob,0
"Yippee! Thanks, Mr. Krabs! I mean",not spongebob,0
Poor Squidward.,spongebob,1
"My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  That's funny. My eyes feel itchy.  And my throat feels scratchy, too.  Itchy eyes, scratchy throat...  Even my mouth feels dry!  I've contracted... Squid's Disease!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, everything all right in here?",not spongebob,0
"Everything's fine, captain. Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure.",spongebob,1
"Well, how about a little less pleasure and a little more work?",not spongebob,0
"If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here?  Grandma always said: 'If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.'  Or was it cold water?  Something tells me it wasn't that either. Of course! It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil!  Uh-huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities.  Oh no!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, everything's fine in here.  Just dandy.  I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious.  This super hot spicy yellow mustard will do the trick. Well no, actually that burns real bad.  Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some—  pickles! Pickles are like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come.  Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns!",spongebob,1
Do you guys hear what's going on?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, and I'm very puzzled.",not spongebob,0
"So am I, in fact, I might even be a little concerned.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something.",spongebob,1
Coming down with something?,not spongebob,0
I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook.,not spongebob,0
Me too. Let's get outta here!,not spongebob,0
Good idea!,not spongebob,0
Me customers!  You look terrible.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!",not spongebob,0
But who's going to run the restaurant?,spongebob,1
Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.,not spongebob,0
Who thought that having an illness could feel so good?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Oh, no! What happened to you?",not spongebob,0
"I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right, Squidward?  Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy  some afternoon tea.",not spongebob,0
"That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?",not spongebob,0
"I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry.",spongebob,1
25 Krabby Patties!  Order up! Order up! Order up!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I didn't order a table patty!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, or a window patty!",not spongebob,0
Or a face patty! I want a refund!,not spongebob,0
Female: I love you Ted. Male: Ditto.,not spongebob,0
"Wasn't that great, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next.",spongebob,1
"Oh, would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much, much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! You're not well enough to return to work! I can't let you!",spongebob,1
Please just stop! Stop following me!,not spongebob,0
Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!,spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.,not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?",spongebob,1
"Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.",not spongebob,0
Squid's Disease? I know just the cure!,spongebob,1
Romantic Comedy?! No!  Ahh! Get that thing away from me!,not spongebob,0
Ah.,not spongebob,0
Make it stop! Ah!,not spongebob,0
Oh.  Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight.",not spongebob,0
"Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone!",not spongebob,0
Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then.,not spongebob,0
"And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?",not spongebob,0
"As you can see, this is the first generation Talking Suburban Dad figurine, with realistic burger-flipping motion.",not spongebob,0
"Not right now, Billy. Daddy's had a long day.",not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"Suburban Dad! No!  You?  You—will remove that subpar woodwind from the premises, ere I smash its reed!",not spongebob,0
Can't practice anywhere in this town.  Bunch of tasteless clowns!,not spongebob,0
"Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh!  Ow! What is that noise?  Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you!",not spongebob,0
What are you–  Hm? Uh? Hm?  Oh!,not spongebob,0
You're welcome!,not spongebob,0
"It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music.",not spongebob,0
One nap later...,not spongebob,0
"Are you ready, my dear? We've got the–",not spongebob,0
"And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place.  And that's when I saw him, my first suspect.  When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%.  He had to be involved.  SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?",spongebob,1
I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me  where!  It!  Is!,not spongebob,0
"I  Don't!  Know!  It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it,  see? There's room for one more.",spongebob,1
His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool.,not spongebob,0
"You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet.",spongebob,1
I don't have friends. I have suspects.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet?  So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?",spongebob,1
Try not to get in the way.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean...  All right, I'll partner up with you this time.  Huh?",spongebob,1
"My...  partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little Good cop, bad cop would get his jaw flapping so I–",not spongebob,0
"Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?",spongebob,1
"Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,spongebob,1
Huh?,spongebob,1
What the–,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?  Now, where were you earlier–",not spongebob,0
"You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal?",spongebob,1
"What are you doing, SpongeBob?  Manicure?",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Makeover?,spongebob,1
Warm blanket?,not spongebob,0
New shoes?,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
Enough!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, check out the dame.",spongebob,1
What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, we're playing Good cop, good cop. Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!",spongebob,1
"We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!",not spongebob,0
"This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove!",not spongebob,0
Good contours.  And still warm. Story checks out.,spongebob,1
"All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time.  Come on, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Mm, hmm.",spongebob,1
"Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!",not spongebob,0
"We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect: maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside.",not spongebob,0
"And then, from the depths of the barbeque, comes the ferocious, fire-breathing  Dad!",not spongebob,0
Bubble Bass!  Ow!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, wait!  Let him handle this.",spongebob,1
Take that! And that!  What?  All right. You've got me cornered. But I won't give up without a fight!,not spongebob,0
I was hoping you'd say that.,not spongebob,0
"It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys.",not spongebob,0
Wait. Wait! Roll the dice. Did his punch land?,not spongebob,0
It's a hit!,not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh.,not spongebob,0
Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?,spongebob,1
I don't know what you're talking about. I was here all day. I swear it!,not spongebob,0
"Billy, don't make me turn this boat around.",not spongebob,0
No! I still could have passed you off as near mint!,not spongebob,0
"Aww. So, sorry, man.",not spongebob,0
I am so sorry for your loss.,spongebob,1
"I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end.",not spongebob,0
"Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects.",not spongebob,0
Patrick Star?,spongebob,1
"Um, yeah, how'd you know?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys!",not spongebob,0
"Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?",not spongebob,0
I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!,not spongebob,0
"Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish.",not spongebob,0
Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...,spongebob,1
Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!,not spongebob,0
"Right behind you, pal.  Huh?  Whoa!",spongebob,1
"When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones.",not spongebob,0
My baby!  Ha!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play!",spongebob,1
"Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music.",spongebob,1
We should solve another mystery now.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went?  Huh?",spongebob,1
Solved!,not spongebob,0
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by: Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective.",not spongebob,0
"♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!♪",not spongebob,0
What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!,not spongebob,0
Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Squidward!,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
What's with all this change nonsense?,not spongebob,0
"Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.",spongebob,1
Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up!  Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.,not spongebob,0
You hardly pay us at all.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, yes! Our meager restitution.  Ah, the sweet smell of payday.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning.  Here's your check.",not spongebob,0
"And here's yours, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs.  Grilling is my passion.",spongebob,1
What is this!?!  You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?,not spongebob,0
"There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.",not spongebob,0
"18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe.",spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?",not spongebob,0
I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.,spongebob,1
"Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.",not spongebob,0
Why?,spongebob,1
"We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!",not spongebob,0
Wow! You and me go on strike?,spongebob,1
"Sure! After all, you like your job, right?",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
"And you want to keep working here, right?",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
"And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?",not spongebob,0
Right!,spongebob,1
Then let's go on strike!,not spongebob,0
"Yay! A strike!  ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪  Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!",spongebob,1
A strike?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
You mean you're going to make picket signs?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
And you're going to make protest speeches?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah!",spongebob,1
And you're going to demand me respect?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah!  Noo...  No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I...  Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob!  News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too!  This is exactly why we need to go on strike.  He can't treat us like this anymore!  He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap.  Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!  Ahem.",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,spongebob,1
"Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.",not spongebob,0
And more?,spongebob,1
"Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.  That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.",not spongebob,0
"I can't do it, Squidward! This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you're pathetic! Look, I threw my hat to the ground.",not spongebob,0
"Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.",not spongebob,0
"Like this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!",not spongebob,0
How's this?,spongebob,1
"...No.  This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point.",not spongebob,0
"How about this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, it's unfair, not funfair!",not spongebob,0
A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.,not spongebob,0
At the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
"Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair!",not spongebob,0
Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!,spongebob,1
What the heck does that mean?,not spongebob,0
I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.,spongebob,1
Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!,not spongebob,0
Yep!,spongebob,1
"Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?",not spongebob,0
"Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?",spongebob,1
"No, I came to take your job.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, thanks, dude!",not spongebob,0
"Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker!  You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?",spongebob,1
Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.,not spongebob,0
"Like this, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect.  Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!",not spongebob,0
I knew it!,not spongebob,0
The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's that guy talking about?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.",not spongebob,0
"We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.",spongebob,1
"With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.,not spongebob,0
"That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.",spongebob,1
"But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!",not spongebob,0
"Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?",spongebob,1
Dismantle your oppressive establishment?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that, too!",spongebob,1
And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!,spongebob,1
On strike with SpongeBob... forever?!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day.  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!",not spongebob,0
"Alright, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"See what I mean?  Squidward, please! You gotta come back!",not spongebob,0
You'll give us anything we want?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?",not spongebob,0
I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action!  I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board!  I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business!  Squidward will be so proud!",spongebob,1
"Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.",not spongebob,0
"I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!",not spongebob,0
S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?,not spongebob,0
"I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.",spongebob,1
Squidward! SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
Here it comes!,spongebob,1
"In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!",not spongebob,0
"Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!",spongebob,1
One eternity later...,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Hey.,spongebob,1
Whatcha doing?,spongebob,1
I'm busy.,not spongebob,0
How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?,spongebob,1
Fourteen!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!",spongebob,1
It is!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?",spongebob,1
What's busy busy?,not spongebob,0
"No, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!",not spongebob,0
I found a jump rope!,spongebob,1
I said not to tell me!  You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Who's the lucky...,spongebob,1
Perfectly brown toast points.   Sparkling kelp juice.   Here's to me!  D'oh! That simpering buffoon!,not spongebob,0
You have a great vocabulary.,not spongebob,0
I know.,not spongebob,0
Indubitably.,not spongebob,0
Go away!,not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.,not spongebob,0
No. I guess I'm just this idiot.,not spongebob,0
"Why, it's beautiful.",not spongebob,0
"You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria. Oh, I've heard of that! Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--  --Squidward Tentacles...  ...'Ploos Oh-nay.'",not spongebob,0
"Ah, it's a plus one.",not spongebob,0
Ahh! What are you still doing here?,not spongebob,0
It's not ploos oh-nay. It says plus one!,not spongebob,0
"Plus one! Oh, yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?",not spongebob,0
"Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes, they put plus one on it to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend.",not spongebob,0
Do you have to do it?,not spongebob,0
"Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.",not spongebob,0
What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?,not spongebob,0
You need to find a friend to take as your plus one.,not spongebob,0
Somebody like me?,spongebob,1
I like openings.,spongebob,1
"No, not like you!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me.",spongebob,1
Let's see here. Friends...,not spongebob,0
"Friends, friends...",not spongebob,0
"Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  ...tonight?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?",not spongebob,0
"But, of course! It's so simple.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, I have something to ask you.",not spongebob,0
Of course I'll go to the opening with you!,spongebob,1
That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went...",spongebob,1
"And then you just initial there, and we're all set.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, there you are!",not spongebob,0
Not in the face!,not spongebob,0
"What? What are you... Oh!  You always were a big kidder, huh?  Mailman  guy?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I'm not a kidder. I'm much more of an introvert.",not spongebob,0
"I love introverts! Why, I'm an introvert!",not spongebob,0
You are?,not spongebob,0
"Say, I bet we have a lot in common.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.",not spongebob,0
That's me!,not spongebob,0
And eating delicious food.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...",not spongebob,0
Spread on a toast point!,not spongebob,0
"Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.",not spongebob,0
"Right? And if there's one thing I hate, it's...",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Clarinets!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I know it... What?",not spongebob,0
"I mean, what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky, hollow, kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hard with nothing to lose could pick up a  clarinet and think Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!  Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.",not spongebob,0
"Buddy?  Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Norton! I've always taken a shine to you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you think you know a guy?  Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.",not spongebob,0
I'll be your friend.,spongebob,1
Who is this?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Yes? I'm still here.,spongebob,1
I need to ask you something important.,not spongebob,0
You don't have to ask me three times.,spongebob,1
Will you tell Larry I want to talk to him?,not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
Okey-doke.,spongebob,1
"So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've been there, amigo.",not spongebob,0
You have?,not spongebob,0
Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.,not spongebob,0
Ever been on one of these little babies?,not spongebob,0
"Um, no. The.. they always seemed a little sporty for me.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.",not spongebob,0
What the heck?,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
We make quite a team!,not spongebob,0
I'll say!,not spongebob,0
"You know, earlier today, I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you know, that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?",not spongebob,0
"You know, you're alright, Lester.",not spongebob,0
It's Larry.,not spongebob,0
"Whatever. The point is, do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but... for you, sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.",not spongebob,0
What?! You don't need that glop!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I wouldn't call it glop. Protein shake saved my life, bro.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on. It's a fad. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake.",not spongebob,0
I mean...,not spongebob,0
"So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?",not spongebob,0
I guess it's just you and me again.,not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you, like this. Wanna play?",spongebob,1
Just get me out of here!,not spongebob,0
Will do.,spongebob,1
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
Anything for a friend.,spongebob,1
Friend?,not spongebob,0
Would you be my plus one?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!,not spongebob,0
You'll always be my plus one!,not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, beautiful springtime. A time for fun and frolic for most...  but not for this poor slob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol.  No one ever comes in on Sunday.  Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home?  SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell!",not spongebob,0
I was just testing it.,spongebob,1
I will ring the bell when there's an order. But...  There's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any!,not spongebob,0
One Krabby Patty coming up!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
"That sounds like me money dropping.  What's going on out here?! My babies!  Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled!  I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up.  Clear the way!  No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Me dime!   No!  I got it, boy!  What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
You've gotta let go of the dime.,spongebob,1
"I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave!  Me arms!",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, not again!",spongebob,1
Wait.  Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.,not spongebob,0
"You can count on me, sir!  Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts.  Takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give you a promotion.",not spongebob,0
Ahh! Really?,spongebob,1
You get to run the cash register.,not spongebob,0
"The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?",spongebob,1
You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing two hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them!,not spongebob,0
Ah... This is the best day of my life.,spongebob,1
"Me, too.",not spongebob,0
"But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?",spongebob,1
I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later.,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
What is it?,not spongebob,0
You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register.,spongebob,1
"You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own.",not spongebob,0
"I can't believe this is really happening.  Today, I start living!",spongebob,1
"Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, could you give me change for a quarter?",not spongebob,0
No problem!  Here ya go!,not spongebob,0
Thanks.,not spongebob,0
I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh!  Sponge...  ...Bob.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?",spongebob,1
"No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar.",not spongebob,0
"Do you want four quarters?  Or ten dimes?  Or twenty nickels?  Or one hundred pennies?  Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies?  Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are...",spongebob,1
"Alright, goodbye.  This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation.  I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...",not spongebob,0
"Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored.  SpongeBob, bored.",not spongebob,0
Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what am I doing?  I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire.",not spongebob,0
"May I help you, sir?",spongebob,1
"It's me, you dunce!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squidward!  How are those errands going?",spongebob,1
What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm sure you are.",spongebob,1
I don't like your tone.,not spongebob,0
I'm sure you are.  How's that?,spongebob,1
Just do your jobs!,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles.  Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge.",spongebob,1
"Must... re...  ...lax!  Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow! Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me: you will not go back to the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
I will destroy the Krusty Krab!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Have you finished...?,spongebob,1
"No!  That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant!",not spongebob,0
Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?,spongebob,1
"No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me!  I know what you're up to.  Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!",not spongebob,0
But I haven't...,spongebob,1
"Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there!",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear  these hats.",spongebob,1
"There!  Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself!  I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care.  Just gonna... Relax.  Let Squid's day off... begin.   What was that?  It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me to see if I'm really doing errands.  But, but he left his post.  And I've finally caught him messing up.  Aha! I caught you, Sponge...  ... Branch.  Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.  I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a...  ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet?",spongebob,1
"Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab!  I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, put some clothes on!",not spongebob,0
The truth will be revealed!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Doc.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom!  And then you were in my bathtub, and  I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, does that mean you're...?",spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.",not spongebob,0
"Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the Closed sign to Open. . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off!",spongebob,1
Bleh!,not spongebob,0
May I help you?,not spongebob,0
"Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? .",not spongebob,0
Nope. .,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward.  Pretty incredible shift, huh?",spongebob,1
If you say so.,not spongebob,0
Any plans after work?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood.   Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there.  So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward? .",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you.  Ever!  Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. .",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! It's been so long. I can't even remember your last visit.",spongebob,1
That's probably because I've never visited you.,not spongebob,0
"Please? Please? Please?!  Please?! Please?!  Please?  Please?  Please? Please? Please?  Please, please? Pleeeaase? Pleaaaaaase? Please? Please?",spongebob,1
"Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time.",spongebob,1
Twenty-four hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any...",spongebob,1
"Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this: Why would I leave the comfort of my home for your dirty little hovel?",not spongebob,0
What if I got a couple of throw pillows?,spongebob,1
. Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home?,spongebob,1
Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed.,not spongebob,0
He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my dirty little hovel.,spongebob,1
"Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back.  Uhh!  Well... hey, thanks for lettin' me play puzzle with you. See ya later!",not spongebob,0
That's it!,spongebob,1
"A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper...  Dya—ah!  Not on the rug!  SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement.",spongebob,1
"Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug!",not spongebob,0
"Oh-okay, Squidward.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!  I need the right tool for the job. Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ... Oh, P.S.",spongebob,1
SquarePants residence.,spongebob,1
Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?,not spongebob,0
Squidward!  It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor!,spongebob,1
"That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?",not spongebob,0
"I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it.",spongebob,1
Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?,not spongebob,0
"You won't even recognize the place, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, probably not.  I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit!",spongebob,1
Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can...,spongebob,1
I just want my vacuum back...  You've made an exact replica of my living room!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of your home.  So I brought the comfort here!  Isn't it great?!",spongebob,1
"No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and...  Never mind. Just give me my vacuum.",not spongebob,0
Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Hot hors d'oeuvres?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Nachos?,spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Blancmange?,spongebob,1
I don't even know what that is!  Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, of course.  Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum.  Please make yourself at home!  Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?",spongebob,1
This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum.  And stop fluffing this pillow!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything.",spongebob,1
"Imbecile.  How did he do it?  He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book.  And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! For Squiddy, with love, Mama.",not spongebob,0
You yelled?,spongebob,1
Never mind! I'll find the vacuum myself!,not spongebob,0
Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit.,spongebob,1
"My hallway...  Dear Neptune!  He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in!  Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home.  Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom.  I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct.  How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet?  My rash cream?  That little sneak! '",not spongebob,0
Did someone say rash cream?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you idiot!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, the rash cream.  Oops.  Oh, no!  I don't think I have a cream for that.",spongebob,1
"Oh, what a horrible nightmare.",not spongebob,0
"So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?'",spongebob,1
Uh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again.,not spongebob,0
"Tsk.  Hurry back, Squidward!",spongebob,1
I’ve gotta find that vacuum and get out of here!,not spongebob,0
"He copied all 492 of my self-portraits...  ...and they're better than mine!  He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything.  This...all of this is just...  Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...  posthaste!  A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home...  Home... with me... with me...",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob!  Is it really you?  It is you!  Come on, baby. We are gonna walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it: with dignity and aplomb.  My house...",not spongebob,0
You just missed the fire.,not spongebob,0
What happened to my house?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, some knucklehead left a casserole in the oven.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed.",spongebob,1
"Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner.  Care for some casserole?",not spongebob,0
Squidward? You okay? Squidward?  Squidward!,spongebob,1
"Ah... Replica, sweet replica.",not spongebob,0
"It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Today,  we study the gentle of rhythm of the sea.",not spongebob,0
"Gentle rhythm!  Oh, never mind.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!,spongebob,1
Ocean wave!!  Tropical breeze.,spongebob,1
Whirlpool!,not spongebob,0
Reverse Whirlpool!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, turn that noise off!  This'll get his attention.",not spongebob,0
Oh!  Oh.,spongebob,1
Sponge...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward! You've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it!",spongebob,1
No!  No!  Don't...  touch...  me!,not spongebob,0
"I'll get a better look.  Mmmmm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures.  Got it. Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing!",spongebob,1
It's called a reeEEEEeeed!,not spongebob,0
What's a  reeEEEEeeed!?,spongebob,1
Great!  My reed...  is still...  stuck in my...  throat!  And it's all your fault!,not spongebob,0
There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy.,spongebob,1
Hmm.  Just as I thought.  You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was  clumsy of you.,not spongebob,0
I didn't! It was SpongeBob who...,not spongebob,0
"Well, there's nothing to do for it, but surgery.",not spongebob,0
Oooooooh!,spongebob,1
Now is my chance to try out my new invention - the solution to your problem.,not spongebob,0
A submarine?,not spongebob,0
"That's right, Squidward. Let me show ya.  This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.  I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size...  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!",not spongebob,0
Why don't you just shrink the reed?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way.  We're all set, Squidward! Are you ready for the sedative?",not spongebob,0
Are you sure this is safe?,not spongebob,0
"Completely! As long as someone competent is behind the wheel. Hey, what's that?!?  Hi-yah! Sweet dreams, partner. Oops! I forgot to pack food for the trip. I've got to get some supplies from my treedome, and I need you to guard the submarine while I'm gone.  Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Hello citizen!,spongebob,1
What are you doing?,not spongebob,0
Guarding Sandy's submarine.,spongebob,1
"Wow, I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside!",not spongebob,0
Can't. I'm guarding it.,spongebob,1
"Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?",not spongebob,0
"You're riiiight!  Patrick, you're a genius!",spongebob,1
Ooohhh!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty!,spongebob,1
Hmm...  Shrink. I do have a lot of issues.,not spongebob,0
Prettyyyy.,not spongebob,0
"I'm back, SpongeBob!  Uh-oh...",not spongebob,0
You're so tiny!  Ahhh!! A giant SpongeBob!!,not spongebob,0
PATRICK! SPONGEBOB!,not spongebob,0
Sandy's grown to gigantic size!,not spongebob,0
"I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk!",spongebob,1
That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward.  Well, the submarine is safely inside you.",not spongebob,0
"Wonderful.  Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?!",not spongebob,0
"Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head?!?! SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...,not spongebob,0
"You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important.",not spongebob,0
"Where are we, Patrick??",spongebob,1
"I don't know, but it's a real dump.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, Patrick! Can you hear me?",not spongebob,0
It's Sandy!,spongebob,1
"She's in there?!?!  I'LL SAVE YOU, SANDY!!!",not spongebob,0
"Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, where are you? Where are we!?",spongebob,1
"You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing  inside of Squidward!",not spongebob,0
I thought this place was in bad shape?,not spongebob,0
I heard that!,not spongebob,0
"Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.",not spongebob,0
Um... we broke it.,spongebob,1
Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?!,not spongebob,0
"This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile. Which you've never successfully done...  so, just take it nice and easy.",not spongebob,0
No problemo! Nice and... EASYYYYYY!!!!!,spongebob,1
"So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!",not spongebob,0
Okay... now what is this!?!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, of course. I've got  head shots, you know.  What the...!?",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
What's happening??,not spongebob,0
Give me that!,spongebob,1
"No, give it back!",not spongebob,0
They're hitting your central nervous system!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, ya think?",not spongebob,0
You're not in control of your actions!  Hey!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not in control of my actions...",not spongebob,0
They've gone off course!  Oh my gosh! You're out of control!,not spongebob,0
"Eww, where are we?   MAYDAY! MAYDAY! WE'RE SINKING, AND PATRICK WON'T STOP SCREAMING!",spongebob,1
The stomach acid levels are way too high!,not spongebob,0
The reserve tanks are almost empty.  PATRICK!,spongebob,1
Finished!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there. It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is.  You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel.  Like natural gas.",not spongebob,0
Natural gas?,spongebob,1
Like this!,not spongebob,0
"Stop burping inside me, that's disgusting!",not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
If you can make a big enough burp...,not spongebob,0
"We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here.",not spongebob,0
Wow...,spongebob,1
He's right.,not spongebob,0
What!?,not spongebob,0
"We're going through with your plan, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
Yay!,spongebob,1
What plan?,not spongebob,0
"Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!!",not spongebob,0
I never thought it would end this way...  It's working!,spongebob,1
Wheeeeee!,not spongebob,0
"They're headed for the esophagus!  Phew, what have you been eating!?",not spongebob,0
Morons.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.,spongebob,1
"Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.",not spongebob,0
I'm already on it.,spongebob,1
Two hours later.,not spongebob,0
This stupid hammer won't break anything.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, do what you were born to do. Dance!",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick! Whirlpool Spin!!",spongebob,1
"Good work, guys. Mission accomplished.  Now all you have to do is...",not spongebob,0
Get out of my body! GO!,not spongebob,0
Grow?,not spongebob,0
Noooooo!!!,not spongebob,0
Almost ready to open.  There.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Mr. Krabs...",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you?",not spongebob,0
"Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.",not spongebob,0
"Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided.  There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile!",not spongebob,0
"Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!",spongebob,1
G-7? King me! King me!  I lose!,not spongebob,0
"But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Tartar sauce!,not spongebob,0
Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?,not spongebob,0
We don't know.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's...",not spongebob,0
Time to find some other game to play!,not spongebob,0
Now what?,spongebob,1
We could toss that shell back and forth.,not spongebob,0
Okay... ready!,spongebob,1
Go!,not spongebob,0
"I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.",spongebob,1
There it is!,not spongebob,0
I got it! I got it!,not spongebob,0
Bonus points!,not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.",spongebob,1
Don't worry. I know how to do this.,not spongebob,0
"Get off him, Patrick!",spongebob,1
What are you worried about?  He looks better already.,not spongebob,0
But he still feels cold.,spongebob,1
"Well, let's go put him in the warm.",not spongebob,0
Do you think he'll be okay?,spongebob,1
"You know, you worry too much.  The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe...  ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe?",not spongebob,0
I don't know.,spongebob,1
It kind of looks like...,not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"No, no, that part goes here.",spongebob,1
"Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.",not spongebob,0
We're almost there. We can do this.,spongebob,1
"It's working, it's working...",not spongebob,0
"This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!",spongebob,1
Look!,not spongebob,0
"I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I thought he was dead.",not spongebob,0
"What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?",not spongebob,0
"No, stay back!",spongebob,1
What is the matter with you two?,not spongebob,0
"Don't, don't hurt us!",not spongebob,0
It was an accident!,spongebob,1
"What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...",not spongebob,0
"Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!",spongebob,1
"Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!",not spongebob,0
We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!,spongebob,1
"Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.",not spongebob,0
Does that include...,spongebob,1
"Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!",not spongebob,0
I think they make a cream for that now.,not spongebob,0
Here?,spongebob,1
Too hot.,not spongebob,0
Here?,spongebob,1
"No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going.",not spongebob,0
Here?,spongebob,1
Toulouse-Lautrec.,not spongebob,0
Too tired...,spongebob,1
"Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.",not spongebob,0
"Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.",spongebob,1
"One watermelon...  Fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness.",not spongebob,0
Art thou not pleased?,spongebob,1
Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.,not spongebob,0
"What do you hunger for, master?",not spongebob,0
"Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.",spongebob,1
Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?,not spongebob,0
I found it.,not spongebob,0
"Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.",not spongebob,0
Flank steak.,spongebob,1
"I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this!",not spongebob,0
But this is just a piece of tissue paper.,spongebob,1
"Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo.",not spongebob,0
I can't do it!,spongebob,1
"Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.",not spongebob,0
I found it.,not spongebob,0
I'll take that!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, are you ready for this?",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming?",spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, it's this way.",spongebob,1
Where?,not spongebob,0
Here.,spongebob,1
"Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?",not spongebob,0
It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!,spongebob,1
"Oh look, you missed some.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?",spongebob,1
We're going to go shopping?,not spongebob,0
No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.,spongebob,1
Ow! What the heck was that?,not spongebob,0
Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.,spongebob,1
Ceremony for what?,not spongebob,0
We're going to put you to rest.,spongebob,1
"I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Oh, really? I'm going to go check.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, get in.",spongebob,1
Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing!,not spongebob,0
But you said we could put you to rest.,spongebob,1
"I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!",not spongebob,0
Now what?,not spongebob,0
"I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but he...  Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Cut that out!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look, the mourners have arrived.",spongebob,1
"Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?",not spongebob,0
"No, just into this hole.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.",not spongebob,0
You're bald?,spongebob,1
"No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!",not spongebob,0
But-,spongebob,1
Do it!,not spongebob,0
"Go home.  But I, Master--",spongebob,1
"I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors!",not spongebob,0
"As you wish, master.",spongebob,1
D'oh!,not spongebob,0
"Boy, he really had us fooled.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.",spongebob,1
You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, say that again.",spongebob,1
That again?,not spongebob,0
"No, the other thing.",spongebob,1
"No, the other thing.",not spongebob,0
"No, what you said before when you...",spongebob,1
"No, what you said before when you...",not spongebob,0
Never mind! I've got an idea.,spongebob,1
Never mind! I've got an idea.,not spongebob,0
I can't reach him!,spongebob,1
Blow harder!  There he goes!,not spongebob,0
Isn't he beautiful?,spongebob,1
How high's he going to go?,not spongebob,0
"All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend!",spongebob,1
Happy trails!,not spongebob,0
You're welcome!,not spongebob,0
He's on the other side now.,spongebob,1
Yeah.  He's in a better place.,not spongebob,0
I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock.,not spongebob,0
"Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later!  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?",spongebob,1
"No, and leave me alone!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Squidward, see ya later.",spongebob,1
"Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.",spongebob,1
Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first.  Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins.  Defeat has never tasted so sweet.  Yello?",not spongebob,0
How 'bout a game of hangman?,spongebob,1
"How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating.",not spongebob,0
"How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks &amp; Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings &amp; Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?",spongebob,1
"It's called, I will never play with you...  ...ever!",not spongebob,0
Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own!,spongebob,1
"I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the...  SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this...",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Squidward.  Squidward! It's me, Mini Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"What are you doing, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
What manner of annoying scheme is this?,not spongebob,0
"Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.",spongebob,1
"Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.",spongebob,1
"Hello, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.",not spongebob,0
"So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Woo-hoo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
Three words.  Movie title.  12 Angry Jellyfish.,not spongebob,0
"How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.",spongebob,1
"Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?",not spongebob,0
"Actually, Patrick, this is...",spongebob,1
"D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard.",not spongebob,0
"Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty?  See... 'cause... they're both... krabby.",not spongebob,0
"Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?",spongebob,1
"Of course, I am. I love to work!",not spongebob,0
Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but isn't he handsome?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, he is handsome.  Ahem.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?",not spongebob,0
"No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?",not spongebob,0
"Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.",not spongebob,0
"Well, thank you very much.",not spongebob,0
"I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.",not spongebob,0
Fine then. Do my work for me.,not spongebob,0
"I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.",not spongebob,0
"Order up, Mini Squid!",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help.",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, pal!  Go get em', tiger!",spongebob,1
"Okay, now, who had the Krabby Patty, and who had the Krabby Patty?",not spongebob,0
What the...? That's my joke!,not spongebob,0
"Wow, honey, this new Mini Squidward is such a card!",not spongebob,0
"And a great waiter, dear.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip!,not spongebob,0
"What? All right, all right!  That's enough! My break is finished.",not spongebob,0
Oh boy! Back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on a second, there.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this — well, not that sorry — the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks! So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately.  Now pipe down and watch how it's done.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.",not spongebob,0
"I, for one, love to watch people dance while I eat. Who's with me? Who wants Mini Squidward to dance for our amusement?",not spongebob,0
"Well, gosh, okay.",not spongebob,0
What's the big deal? Those are all my moves!  Ta-da!,not spongebob,0
Talk about no talent!,not spongebob,0
Maybe Squidward should get sized-reduction surgery so he'll dance better!,not spongebob,0
That Mini Squid...,not spongebob,0
Everybody dance!,not spongebob,0
That was awful!,not spongebob,0
He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend! Stop stealing my life!,not spongebob,0
"Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please! You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!",not spongebob,0
Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.,not spongebob,0
Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for Curly Bubbles Records.,not spongebob,0
You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?,not spongebob,0
The answer to that question is a big N-O.  This little fella on the other hand is woo-hoo woo-hoo good! We're offering him a million dollar contract and a sequin suit.,not spongebob,0
A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original.,not spongebob,0
"Now, where do I sign?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, right, kid!",not spongebob,0
"Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?",spongebob,1
"Yep, those were the days.",not spongebob,0
"But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures.  Arrivederci,  mon frere.",spongebob,1
"Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't.",not spongebob,0
"Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?",spongebob,1
"My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!",spongebob,1
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform.",not spongebob,0
"On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?",not spongebob,0
"Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.",not spongebob,0
"You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.",not spongebob,0
"Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear...  Oh, no, he's hot!  I'm, uhh, in... food service.",not spongebob,0
"Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier!",not spongebob,0
Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse.  I own a five-star restaurant!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.",not spongebob,0
That's right.,not spongebob,0
And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight.,not spongebob,0
T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?,not spongebob,0
"In fact, we'll all come. My treat!",not spongebob,0
"Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!",not spongebob,0
"Aww, BOO-HOO, let me play a sad song for ya on the world's smallest violin.",not spongebob,0
This is serious.,not spongebob,0
"I know, this really is the world's smallest violin.  See?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.,not spongebob,0
Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?  That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?,not spongebob,0
Don't rub it in.,not spongebob,0
Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible.  Patrick, what are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
"I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!",not spongebob,0
"The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh!  Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?",not spongebob,0
"You mean like a weenie? Okay!  May I take your hat, thir? May I take your haaaat, sir? May I-",not spongebob,0
"Alright, I've heard enough, you've got the job.  Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?",not spongebob,0
Aye-aye!,not spongebob,0
Then you'll be our chef.,not spongebob,0
What can I do?,spongebob,1
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,spongebob,1
It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.,not spongebob,0
Do other restaurants do that?,spongebob,1
"Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this.",not spongebob,0
"How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes. Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!",spongebob,1
"Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!",not spongebob,0
GIVE ME MY HAT!  I SAID GIVE IT TO ME! Are you gonna hand it over or not? DON'T YOU BACK-SASS ME!,not spongebob,0
"He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential.  What happened!? What is it?!?",not spongebob,0
Peas!  Made 'em the old-fashioned way.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the...  HOLY FISH PASTE! WHAT IS THAT!?",not spongebob,0
That's the appetizer!,not spongebob,0
But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?,not spongebob,0
"Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.",not spongebob,0
"There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.",not spongebob,0
Empty my mind?,spongebob,1
Empty your mind.,not spongebob,0
Empty my mind...,spongebob,1
Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.,not spongebob,0
Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!,not spongebob,0
Everything?,not spongebob,0
"Everything!  Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies!  Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it!  Come on, let's get moving!  Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?",not spongebob,0
You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.,not spongebob,0
One more crack like that and you're out of here!,not spongebob,0
"No, please! I have three kids!",not spongebob,0
"How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working!  I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Squiddy!  We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!",not spongebob,0
"Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school,  are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star...  ...restaurant!?  Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina...",not spongebob,0
Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!,spongebob,1
How did you do all this?,not spongebob,0
"It was easy, once I cleared my mind.",spongebob,1
But what about Krabs and Patrick?,not spongebob,0
"Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank.",spongebob,1
Mmm... this is fantastic!,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, sir.",spongebob,1
"Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"If you need anything else, just call.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!",not spongebob,0
Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.,spongebob,1
"It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.",not spongebob,0
"Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!",not spongebob,0
"In that case, I need you to read this.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Squidward Tentacles...",not spongebob,0
And I need you to wear this.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, eh, Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest...",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, one more time.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs.  Squidward, I must tell you...  Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name.",not spongebob,0
My name?,spongebob,1
"Yes, your name, son.",not spongebob,0
Uhh... Beef Wellington?,spongebob,1
"No, your name.",not spongebob,0
Uhh... err... the fork on the left?,spongebob,1
Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.,not spongebob,0
My name?,spongebob,1
What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, baby, what's the name?!?",not spongebob,0
We threw out his name!,not spongebob,0
I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...,not spongebob,0
More soup for your armpit?,spongebob,1
"PLEASE ENJOY THE FOOD.  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?",spongebob,1
No! Nooo!,not spongebob,0
"RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, EVERYONE! IT'S THE APPETIZER!!!",not spongebob,0
"Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too!",not spongebob,0
Is that true?,not spongebob,0
"Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino!",not spongebob,0
"Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?",spongebob,1
"Oh, the usual.  WOULD YOU GET OUT OF HERE!?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams!",not spongebob,0
"Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you!",not spongebob,0
I hope I do as good as that guy.,spongebob,1
"Man, those people will laugh at anything. Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you.",not spongebob,0
Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants!,not spongebob,0
"Go get 'em, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?",spongebob,1
"And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup?",spongebob,1
"Oh, brother, THIS GUY STINKS!",not spongebob,0
"HEY, HEY, FUNNY GUY! I'VE GOT A JOKE FOR YOU! WHAT SMELLS ROTTEN AND PUTS PEOPLE TO SLEEP?",not spongebob,0
"Umm, noxious gas?",spongebob,1
NO! YOUR ACT!,not spongebob,0
"Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh...",spongebob,1
Forks?! Come on!,not spongebob,0
"Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?",spongebob,1
That's true.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too.",spongebob,1
Squirrel fur!,not spongebob,0
"And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?",spongebob,1

"♪La La La La La La La La! Getting clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Oh, what a delightful day it is to get...♪  Noooooo!  Good thing I have a spare.  I still have one more thing to clean!  Oh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet!  And now I'm ready to go to work!  You've got to be more careful, SquarePants!  Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... ... that! Oh, I saw you. Not going to fool me this time, soap.  This is not going well.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber ducky?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, is that it?",spongebob,1
"I found you! Duckie Duck!  Quack, quack, quack!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Huh...,not spongebob,0
"I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here.",spongebob,1
"What do you need, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean.",spongebob,1
"Stuck? I can help with that.  There you go, buddy. Now you're stuck forever!",not spongebob,0
"Gee, thanks, Patrick! Now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?!  Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck, not more stuck! How am I going to get to work when I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of wringer!",spongebob,1
"There, is that better?",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?",spongebob,1
"Okay, you know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?",not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
"And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion?  Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame-broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, Hey! I can! I'm ready!",spongebob,1
That's the spirit!,not spongebob,0
"Woo!  Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!",spongebob,1
"Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!",spongebob,1
"It's about time.  Hey, SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!",not spongebob,0
"Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.",spongebob,1
"Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks, pal.",spongebob,1
Ohh! Squidward!  Squidward!  Are you okay?,spongebob,1
"Please, just get away from me.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?",not spongebob,0
Ohh! A refill!,spongebob,1
"Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot!  Ow! My back!  My face!",not spongebob,0
"Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!",spongebob,1
Me money! What do you think you're doing?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy...,not spongebob,0
"Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.",spongebob,1
Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, SpongeBob, how was work?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack.",spongebob,1
Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.,not spongebob,0
You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!,spongebob,1
Dig in!,not spongebob,0
I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!,spongebob,1
"Bummer. Hey, you know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean.",not spongebob,0
Look! The ball toss!,not spongebob,0
"Step right up, folks! Toss a ball, hit the cans, and win a stuffed seahorse!",not spongebob,0
We want to play!,not spongebob,0
Sure. Give me your best shot.,not spongebob,0
Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try.,not spongebob,0
"Ohh! Oh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we got to do that!",not spongebob,0
I don't know... I have too much eye pain.,spongebob,1
"Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!",spongebob,1
"Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too!  Check it out!",not spongebob,0
"That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.",spongebob,1
"Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.",not spongebob,0
I said I don't want any!,spongebob,1
You ruined my cotton candy!,not spongebob,0
Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!,spongebob,1
Check it out! Public fight!,not spongebob,0
Working at the carnival sure has its perks!,not spongebob,0
I have never felt so ashamed.,spongebob,1
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
"If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!",spongebob,1
I was only trying to help.,not spongebob,0
Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today!,spongebob,1
"Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore!",not spongebob,0
"Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.",spongebob,1
"You know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart.  You deserve what you've gotten. Come on, we're out of here.  Some people are just born mean.",not spongebob,0
"Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.",not spongebob,0
"Maybe if SpongeBob was here, he could give you pointers.",not spongebob,0
"Who asked you?!  Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Hey, what are you watching?",not spongebob,0
"My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!",not spongebob,0
What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.,spongebob,1
"Oh, man, he's too far gone.",not spongebob,0
Not fit to live in society...,spongebob,1
This is all my fault!  Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry!,not spongebob,0
Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!,spongebob,1
All right!,not spongebob,0
"I guess crying does solve your problems after all.  Come here, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?",not spongebob,0
"Whoo! Yeah!  Oh, oh!  Oh!  Ooh!  Oh!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I need—  Whoa. Sponge—",not spongebob,0
"Patty, no!  Oh, I can't quite reach it.",spongebob,1
"Listen here, boy-o! As long as that patty's stuck in the chimney, it's money outta me pocket! You're gonna have to go up there and fish it out.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights.  Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept.  There you are!  Good as new!  Hold on, patty! I've got you!  No!",spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob. Time to come back down and get to work so I can garnish your wages for wasting that patty!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all.",spongebob,1
"Nonsense, boy-o. Just climb on down!",not spongebob,0
"No, I'm good!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I order you to come down here immediately!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, I'll get him down with my newest invention: Extend-O-Boots. I just press this button, and...  Whoa!  Sorry, I haven't worked out all the kinks yet!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa-oh-oh!  Whoa!",not spongebob,0
What the—,not spongebob,0
"So, uh... anybody else got an idea?",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, I got him!  Hey, SpongeBob. Whatcha doing wa-a-ay up here?  Let's climb down now.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead.  I just can't do it. It's too far down!",spongebob,1
"Aw, don't worry, SpongeBob. Your old pal Patrick has another plan to get you off this roof.",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
Sure. Just do what I do.  Hm...  Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am.",spongebob,1
"Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there.  Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone!  Ah!  Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you.",spongebob,1
"Hm? Oh! Oh, that feels good.  Huh?!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, maybe he's hungry.  Come on, Squidward! Eat your...  Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp!  Ow-ow-ow-ow!  Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep.  Oh, I wish I had my bed...  Hey, that gives me an idea.",spongebob,1
"Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
Perfect. Good night...  nobody.,spongebob,1
"Yoo-hoo, SpongeBob! Time to wake up!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"I've come up with a solution for your little roof problem, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
Now you can cook even if you can't get back down.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Now start making me money!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again!  Something still doesn't feel right, though.",spongebob,1
"Perfect! Just like my old kitchen.  I'm ready!  Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers?  Eureka!",spongebob,1
"We paid for patties, Krabs! Where's our food?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, calm down, everyone. I'm sure we can figure something out that doesn't involve violence or...refunds.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, outside! It's raining Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Safe!,not spongebob,0
"I'll take one Krabby Patty and a drink, please.  I said, And a drink!",not spongebob,0
Huh?  These are cold! I paid for a hot meal.,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Maybe if we go up there, we can get 'em fresh!",not spongebob,0
To the roof!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Whoa! I better make more room up here.,spongebob,1
"You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser.  But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming!",not spongebob,0
Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.,spongebob,1
"Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now.",not spongebob,0
"Ten more patties, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
Aw...,spongebob,1
"No, no—me money!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I just realized being outside is awful!",not spongebob,0
Rain? But we're under—,not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, don't go!  A little wind never hurt anyone!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, whoa!  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!",spongebob,1
"It's beautiful, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, it's pretty nice, but now that we're not outside, I'm starting to get bored.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, so...",not spongebob,0
Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing!  Whoo!,spongebob,1
He's right!,not spongebob,0
Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!,spongebob,1
"You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!",not spongebob,0
And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!,spongebob,1
Time to go home already?  Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Sounds like Squidward ate at Mario's last night.  Good thing no one's around to notice his embarrassing...  Those construction workers! Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises.  I'll cover for him! Whoa!  Sorry, fellas, this sure is a noisy trowel.  Listen to this thing!  Ah, I really should get...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, can you keep it down? I am trying to hone my musical talent here.",not spongebob,0
You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?,spongebob,1
And you guys!  Do you really think that billboard is more important than my musical genius?,not spongebob,0
"Well, sorry, but some of us rather enjoy the Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra.",not spongebob,0
Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?,not spongebob,0
And we find their public announcements to be quite interesting.,not spongebob,0
"Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer?  Thank you, thank you!  That would be nice.",not spongebob,0
Ew!,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hooo! Yeah! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
You've really made him happy.,spongebob,1
I know what I've done.,not spongebob,0
Okay...,spongebob,1
"Okay.  Get it together, Squidward. Put your game face on.  Ah, that's better.  Take your time with this one, Squidward, old boy.  Due tomorrow?!  Only one day to write my masterpiece!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together.",spongebob,1
"No!  Get out!  Patrick, what're you doing here?",not spongebob,0
Uhh... I don't know.  I'm funny.,not spongebob,0
"Are you sure you don't need any help, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"No, thank you.  I am a solitary artist.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, SpongeBob...",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I think I broke my bottom.,not spongebob,0
"Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa!",spongebob,1
Yeah!  Ah. Much better.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor.",spongebob,1
I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance.,not spongebob,0
What job is that?,spongebob,1
Exactly.,not spongebob,0
I'm a genius!,not spongebob,0
"The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star.  Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.",spongebob,1
Can't you two be quiet for one day? My composition is due tomorrow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. My patient is very sick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I broke my butt.",not spongebob,0
"Become famous, revenge later. Hmm.  Come on! Be inspired!  Brilliant!",not spongebob,0
"Noooo!  Why? Why? Why? Oh, why?  Dowrgghgh!  I did it!  Hahahahahaha! Yes!  I did it! I did it! I did it! And I did it! Ha ha ha ha!",not spongebob,0
Did what?,not spongebob,0
"Here you go, maestro, my masterpiece.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, ohh, very unusual. I think we have a winner, Mr. Tentacles!",not spongebob,0
"Good evening, music lovers of Bikini Bottom. Tonight, is the premiere of a new symphony, written by one of our own, Squidward Tentacles.",not spongebob,0
I wrote down everything I heard?,not spongebob,0
Oooo! That's gonna leave a mark!,not spongebob,0
Poor guy.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, get off of me!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, now that's what I call music!",not spongebob,0
That little yellow guy is awesome!,not spongebob,0
Let us not forget the tubby starfish!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, but the real genius is the composer!  Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Squidward, they really liked you! Just don't get a swelled head.",spongebob,1
"Have a good summer vacation, I'll see you all next fall!  Well... Hopefully not all of you.",not spongebob,0
Weee!,not spongebob,0
Time to vamoose!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mrs. Puff?",spongebob,1
Where are my keys!?,not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff!?,spongebob,1
Come on!,not spongebob,0
I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff?,spongebob,1
I gotta get out of here!  Phew! I lost him.,not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?,spongebob,1
Why can't you take a hint?!,not spongebob,0
Help!,spongebob,1
"Oh dear, of course I'll help.",not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!,spongebob,1
"Why won't he just let-  Oh no! Not again! If my parole officer finds out, I don't stand a chance! I'll be sentenced for life this time!",not spongebob,0
Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It would be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if this information were to leak out to the authorities.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, don't tell the police, I'll be a dead man if I get caught! I'll do anything!",not spongebob,0
It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, gracious me, I don't have that kind of cash!",not spongebob,0
Don't worry! I think we can work something out.,not spongebob,0
Huh? You mean we should go out on a date?,not spongebob,0
"Err... interesting, no, I had something else in mind. Surprise, SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker.",not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff!,spongebob,1
"She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?",not spongebob,0
That's right.,not spongebob,0
She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close.,not spongebob,0
"It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I got your note alright.",not spongebob,0
So what do you think?,spongebob,1
"What did I think!? I think it caused me to- Let's just say, it changed my life.",not spongebob,0
"It certainly has. Now, SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! I get to show you the ropes, Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now.",spongebob,1
Patience is a virtue.,not spongebob,0
Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?,spongebob,1
Why don't we just start with my basic duties?,not spongebob,0
"Eager to get behind the wheel, eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!",spongebob,1
"There are many like it, but this one is mine.",not spongebob,0
Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember: Good Grades.,spongebob,1
Always follow diligent notes!,not spongebob,0
"I know, SpongeBob. I taught you that phrase!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh, yes! The total key is a bit sticky, so you're gonna have to be forceful, but not too forceful. Get it?",spongebob,1
"Forceful, but not too forceful.",not spongebob,0
"You did! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm?",spongebob,1
Fine...,not spongebob,0
"Good day, ma lady, charmed, I'm sure.",spongebob,1
"Heh, funny costume, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day.",spongebob,1
"Of course, Mr. Féyêdêmuffin. What would you like to eat today?",not spongebob,0
"Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as duke.",spongebob,1
You mean to refer to you as Duke?,not spongebob,0
"Of course, how else one refer to me? I am a duke after all, now I shall fancy a meal if quite alright with you.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, duke, what will you have?",not spongebob,0
I shall have... Beans on toast please.,not spongebob,0
"All right, one beans on toast coming up!",not spongebob,0
"Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast.",spongebob,1
This is just ridiculous! Would you simply explain my duties please?!,not spongebob,0
"What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?",not spongebob,0
"Oh dear... Message received, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Just don't let it happen again, Puff.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!",spongebob,1
"Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I take your order?",not spongebob,0
Yes!,spongebob,1
One Krabby Patty please?,not spongebob,0
$1 please. Thank you.,not spongebob,0
"Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook.",spongebob,1
One Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity.,spongebob,1
Fine! Here's your written form!,not spongebob,0
"One Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?",spongebob,1
What now?,not spongebob,0
"I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although, a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far, student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P, look out for the barrel!",spongebob,1
I'll give your barr-,not spongebob,0
"Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go, Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though.",spongebob,1
That's it! I don't care anymore! This isn't worth it!  I will not be humiliated any longer!,not spongebob,0
Don't forget to read the note!,spongebob,1
You! It's because of you I got stuck in this mess!,not spongebob,0
"Hold it right there! Well, well, well, if it ain't Mrs. Puff. I saw what you did.",not spongebob,0
I. You did?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Oh please! I didn't mean to do it! I swear!,not spongebob,0
"It's too late for swearing Puff! The evidence is right here.  You littered, now you're going to the stony lonesome.",not spongebob,0
"Littered? You're absolutely right, officer! Yes! I sure did litter! That's what I did!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, all right. You're under arrest now.",not spongebob,0
"No problem, officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!",not spongebob,0
"Tell it to the judge, Mrs. Puff!",not spongebob,0
"1 day down, 2,528 to go! That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob! I'm going to enjoy this!",not spongebob,0
"Get up, Puff! The judge says you have to go to traffic school.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wow! A Driver's Education class! This is just how I made a living except without HIM. Delightful!",not spongebob,0
"Good day, class!",spongebob,1
I must be having a nightmare! What's he doing here?!,not spongebob,0
"Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
Get me outta here!,not spongebob,0
Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1.,spongebob,1
I thought you left your swim suit at home.,spongebob,1
"No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg!",not spongebob,0
Rotten eggs?!,spongebob,1
Honey.,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"You're not using that tan accelerator again, are you?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't pretend you don't love it.",not spongebob,0
"Good work, man!  I see you've read my book.",not spongebob,0
Craig Mammalton?,not spongebob,0
The tannest man on TV?,not spongebob,0
None other.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look at those gorgeous wrinkles.",not spongebob,0
"What, these?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, and his skin, it's so leathery!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't mean to brag, but, uh...",not spongebob,0
Who's Craig Mammalton?,spongebob,1
"You don't know who Craig Mammalton is? He's like, so tan! Legend has it that his tan is so deep, that even his bones are a rich caramel brown!",not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
His mother must be so proud.,not spongebob,0
"Please, people, please. There'll be plenty of time to admire my body this weekend, at my annual summer shindig.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is!",spongebob,1
"Can I help you, little fella?",not spongebob,0
It seems to be stuck.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, I don't think this is your type of party. I don't want to embarrass you guys... Hey, everyone, check this out!  ...but this party is for the pig-mentally gifted.",not spongebob,0
Must be this tan to enter.,spongebob,1
"And your skin is as light and smooth as a, well, as a baby's bottom.",not spongebob,0
"Why, thank you.",spongebob,1
We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today.,not spongebob,0
"In fact,  it's time for another coat.",spongebob,1
We've gotta look our best.,not spongebob,0
Losers.,not spongebob,0
"You're not coming to my party, without a tan.",not spongebob,0
"There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure.",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Me first! Me first!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?",spongebob,1
Like one of those hip young old folks from a soda commercial.,not spongebob,0
It's radical!  Radical!  Drink it!,not spongebob,0
"My turn!  Remember, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly.",spongebob,1
"Gotcha, 15 seconds, give or take a few minutes.",not spongebob,0
"No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working!  Okay, Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?",spongebob,1
What? Did somebody say something?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, there!",not spongebob,0
Is that tan for us?,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out!",spongebob,1
Two hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Do you really have to go, Patrick?",not spongebob,0
"Afraid so. Bye, girls.",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Pat.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's so leathery.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, how do I look?",spongebob,1
"Oh, it's you. You don't look too good.",not spongebob,0
"What, what, what do you mean?",spongebob,1
See for yourself.,not spongebob,0
I must have been under the tanning machine too long!,spongebob,1
"Ew, what are you going to do?",not spongebob,0
"I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do.  Hi, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"What is it now, Sponge--- Ghost! I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward.  I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long.",spongebob,1
"Oh, this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party.  Sun Bleached!",not spongebob,0
"Huh, now I'll never get into that party.",spongebob,1
"Hey, that's quitter talk, mister! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover!  A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide.  What do you think?",not spongebob,0
I look... amazing! Time to go to the party!  Oh what a cute wittle baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo.,spongebob,1
Monster!,not spongebob,0
"Well, hey, buddy, looks like you could use an ice cream.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, that hit the spot.",spongebob,1
"One caramel sundae, please.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go.  Patrick, why did you...",spongebob,1
"Can't talk, working.",not spongebob,0
"No, really, Patrick, what are you...  Ugh. I feel sticky.",spongebob,1
Take a look.,not spongebob,0
"Wooh!  Thanks, Patrick!  Uh, I'm stuck.",spongebob,1
"Nice job, Ma'am. Join the party! Ahem, but the baby's going to have to wait outside.",not spongebob,0
But he's the perfect shade of Tropical Toddler.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, but...",not spongebob,0
Tyler! How could you?!,not spongebob,0
"Now, don't worry, Ma'am, he can wait out here, with the other rejects.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no tears, son, we'll get in next year.",not spongebob,0
"Next.  Hey, hey, hey! Looks like you two took my advice! Nice job, gentlemen. Come on in!  All right, party people! It's time to roll out the portables.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here!   Patrick? Patrick?",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
Can I get a little help here?,spongebob,1
"Oh, sure thing, pal. Hey, everybody, make some room! The floor's all yours! Knock 'em dead, kid.",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, I...",spongebob,1
So bright!,not spongebob,0
"Honey, look away!",not spongebob,0
Nice job!,not spongebob,0
"Your hideously white skin just ruined the party. I mean, look at you! Do you hug your mother with that skin?",not spongebob,0
Can you believe this guy crashed your party? Craig?,not spongebob,0
I have seen this only one other time. It's the ultimate tan! He's...  ...Sun Bleached!,not spongebob,0
Sun Bleached?!,not spongebob,0
"This young man... This young hero, should be praised for his dedication to tanliness.  If you guys are feeling it, we should all follow in his footsteps.  Frankie, crank it up!",not spongebob,0
Two hours later.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing?",spongebob,1
Whatever. I just gooooo with the flow.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha...",spongebob,1
"Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...",not spongebob,0
"Sandy?  Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?",spongebob,1
"Look, she's on the eating channel.",not spongebob,0
"Howdy,  if y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called HIBERNATION.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So, do not disturb!  ...That means you, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
We better put these on.,not spongebob,0
"Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.",spongebob,1
"When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? No means yes!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Look at this!,not spongebob,0
What is this stuff?,spongebob,1
"It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful!",spongebob,1
"What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?",not spongebob,0
Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!,spongebob,1
"It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look!",not spongebob,0
I guess you're right. It's okay here!,spongebob,1
"Take it off, no one's lookin'.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?",not spongebob,0
I think it came from Sandy's tree.,spongebob,1
That is one tired tree.,not spongebob,0
Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed!,spongebob,1
Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!,not spongebob,0
I think this thing is Sandy.,spongebob,1
Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.,not spongebob,0
"I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy...",not spongebob,0
"She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.",spongebob,1
I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.,not spongebob,0
"Oooh, you better run faster, Sandy!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I'm getting away! Faster!",not spongebob,0
"Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!",spongebob,1
Faster! faster!,not spongebob,0
I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics...,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.",spongebob,1
"That's not disturbing, this is disturbing.  Hi there, SpongeBob, my name is PATBACK.",not spongebob,0
Ha! That is really disturbing!,spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
"Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!",not spongebob,0
Sandy! NO! STOP!,spongebob,1
"I warned you, Dirty Dan. Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, it's us, your friends, SpongeBob and Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!",not spongebob,0
Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots...,not spongebob,0
Fun's over.,not spongebob,0
"Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Pat!",spongebob,1
I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks?,not spongebob,0
"Well, that oughta work.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Sandy, does it work?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up!",not spongebob,0
"See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!",spongebob,1
"You'll never catch me!  Hey, that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.",not spongebob,0
They couldn't afford station wagons either!,spongebob,1
Nice paneling.,not spongebob,0
"All right, Pinhead. Your time is up!",spongebob,1
"Hey, who you callin' Pinhead? I wanna be Dirty Dan!",not spongebob,0
What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?,spongebob,1
I'm dirty.,not spongebob,0
I'd say I'm Dirty Dan.,spongebob,1
I'd say I'm Dirty Dan!,not spongebob,0
Ow!  I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!,not spongebob,0
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!,not spongebob,0
I'm Dirty Dan! Oof!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!,not spongebob,0
I'm Dirty Dan! D'oh!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!,not spongebob,0
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan. Ee!,not spongebob,0
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!,spongebob,1
I'm Dirty Dan.,not spongebob,0
AAAAAAAHHH!,spongebob,1
Screaming will get you nowh-,not spongebob,0
Which one of you fellers is the REAL Dirty Dan?,not spongebob,0
Uh...I am?,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,spongebob,1
Hot wings!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours!  PINHEEEEAAAADDDD!!!!  Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya!  Okay, I warned ya!",spongebob,1
"Did you win?  Hi, SpongeBob!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick.",not spongebob,0
Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again!,spongebob,1
Ouch!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!",spongebob,1
"Let me have a try.  *Ptuh* *Ptuh* Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do...",not spongebob,0
Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.,spongebob,1
Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?,not spongebob,0
N-n-n-no.,spongebob,1
I'm so c-cold that I'm sh-shivering.,not spongebob,0
I'm so cold...  that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks.,spongebob,1
I'm so c-cold... that... I'm shivering.,not spongebob,0
Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!,spongebob,1
"You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead!",not spongebob,0
"The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?",spongebob,1
Maybe she just ignores it.,not spongebob,0
Maybe...,spongebob,1
Maybe...,not spongebob,0
Maybe it's her fur!,spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Look at all that warm, toasty fur.",spongebob,1
"It's like a gold mine, but with fur.",not spongebob,0
Carefully...carefully?,spongebob,1
"Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!",not spongebob,0
"All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right?",spongebob,1
"Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, big man!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I've lived a full life!",spongebob,1
This is taking too long! I want the warm now!,not spongebob,0
"Pat, no!  Pat, are you crazy?!",spongebob,1
"No, I'm warm.",not spongebob,0
Let me see that roll of tape.,spongebob,1
"Man, that fur really hits the spot. No more frozen armpits!",not spongebob,0
And this eyebrow-goatee-combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.,spongebob,1
You said it!,not spongebob,0
"I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!",spongebob,1
BRING IT ON!!!,not spongebob,0
...Spring?,spongebob,1
"Wow, spring already!",not spongebob,0
Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!,spongebob,1
I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Sandy.  Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob... Patrick...,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.",spongebob,1
"More lemonade, boys?",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Sandy.",not spongebob,0
Spring sure is lovely.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?",not spongebob,0
Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.,spongebob,1
You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock.  He had a lump on his head—",spongebob,1
"I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this.  Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.",not spongebob,0
Fish flute?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the—",not spongebob,0
None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—",spongebob,1
"None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not even—even—oh, there's nobody there.",not spongebob,0
"He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?",not spongebob,0
"Who's doing what, now?",not spongebob,0
"The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!",not spongebob,0
"What, the door on your way out?",not spongebob,0
"No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.",not spongebob,0
I warn you against it.,not spongebob,0
Too late!,not spongebob,0
Who said that?,not spongebob,0
Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, really?",not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.",not spongebob,0
You do?,not spongebob,0
"You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's not exactly why I—",not spongebob,0
Shameless. You again?,not spongebob,0
"I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.",not spongebob,0
"Why, yes, it is, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, it—not buying that one either, huh?",not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, buddy!  Squidward!  Free cleaning service?  Census taker.  Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies?  Ow!",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, what are you doing?",not spongebob,0
"There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish.  Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula?",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Plankton. Nice dress.",spongebob,1
"Out of my way, SpongeBrain.",not spongebob,0
"I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round.  Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master.",spongebob,1
None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.,not spongebob,0
"Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music.",spongebob,1
Music?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own.",spongebob,1
"Oh, is that right?",not spongebob,0
Not again.,not spongebob,0
"Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.",not spongebob,0
Are you sure you got the right squid?,not spongebob,0
"I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic.",not spongebob,0
"Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.",not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.",not spongebob,0
Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!,not spongebob,0
"Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?",not spongebob,0
"It's delightful!  Bravo!  Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
My very own fan.,not spongebob,0
Did you hear that?,not spongebob,0
How could I not?,not spongebob,0
Bravo!,not spongebob,0
"No, no! Make it stop!",not spongebob,0
"Encore, encore, encore!",not spongebob,0
I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.,not spongebob,0
"Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...",not spongebob,0
Want to... sing?,not spongebob,0
That's the word I was looking for!,not spongebob,0
"A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four.",not spongebob,0
"♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ ♪To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ ♪No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...♪",not spongebob,0
It's all in the wrist.,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, thank you.",not spongebob,0
"Say, uh, musical genius?",not spongebob,0
Yes?,not spongebob,0
"When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?",not spongebob,0
It is an unfortunate truth.,not spongebob,0
"And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?",not spongebob,0
That's an understatement.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register.",not spongebob,0
"But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.",not spongebob,0
Nope. Haven't seen a thing.,not spongebob,0
"You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed.,not spongebob,0
We have—,not spongebob,0
Mayday! Mayday!,not spongebob,0
"In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.",not spongebob,0
"But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula.  Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No!  Come back, I need you!  Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!",not spongebob,0
Hey!  Come back!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing doorslam and I was wondering if I could—Squidward: Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!",spongebob,1
Whoo! I wanna play!,spongebob,1
"Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is.",not spongebob,0
"Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!",spongebob,1
"You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!",not spongebob,0
We've got you surrounded.,not spongebob,0
You do? Oh.,not spongebob,0
We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument.,not spongebob,0
"Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.",not spongebob,0
"He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar—",spongebob,1
"There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course.",not spongebob,0
Watch your head.,not spongebob,0
"No, wait! Please! Karen, help!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you won't be needing this where you're going.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet.",spongebob,1
"Once again, I hate people.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is.  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble.",spongebob,1
"Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners!  You're about as ugly as homemade soup.",not spongebob,0
"Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!",spongebob,1
"Hold on there, little square dude!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you like karate too.  So, uhh, what's your name?",spongebob,1
Sandy.  So what do y'all call yourself?,not spongebob,0
I'm SpongeBob!,spongebob,1
"Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this.",not spongebob,0
Oh.  Oh yeah? Watch this,spongebob,1
"I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah!  Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?",spongebob,1
"Why, that's my air helmet.",not spongebob,0
May I try it on?,spongebob,1
Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air.,not spongebob,0
Me too. I love air. Air is good.,spongebob,1
No kidding?,not spongebob,0
"Why, air is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.",spongebob,1
Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then?  Don't be late.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.,spongebob,1
Do you mean she puts on airs?,not spongebob,0
I guess so.,spongebob,1
"That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.",not spongebob,0
How's that?,spongebob,1
Higher.,not spongebob,0
Like that?,spongebob,1
"Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants.  Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, pal.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
"Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob.",spongebob,1
"Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.",not spongebob,0
"Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here.",spongebob,1
‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.,not spongebob,0
No water?,spongebob,1
"That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!",not spongebob,0
Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water.,spongebob,1
"Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah!  That's not in. In.  You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.  So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest...  ...purest...  ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath.  And that's my oak tree.  It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees?  Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I...  ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now.",not spongebob,0
Pinky. Pinky.,not spongebob,0
I brought you some flowers.,spongebob,1
For me? How sweet.  You okay?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'm okay.",spongebob,1
"You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.",not spongebob,0
I can’t imagine why.,spongebob,1
Can I get you anything?,not spongebob,0
Water would be nice.,spongebob,1
I'm gonna to put these in a vase.,not spongebob,0
Take your time.  I gotta get out of here!,spongebob,1
"I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree.",not spongebob,0
"When in doubt, pinky out.",not spongebob,0
"I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it...",spongebob,1
"Why, these flowers are just beautiful!  They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water.  So tell me about yourself.  It must be fascinating bein' a sea critter.  SpongeBob?  Oh, there's the cookies.  Be right back.",not spongebob,0
"I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I need it!",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!",not spongebob,0
I'm a quitter!,spongebob,1
You can't leave now. You'll blow it.,not spongebob,0
"Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.",spongebob,1
"You're just being shy.  Don't worry, buddy. You're doi'’ fine.  I won't let you blow... this.  What kind of place is this?!  There's no water in here!",not spongebob,0
I tried to tell you!,spongebob,1
We've gotta get out of here!,not spongebob,0
You're... doing it... wrong...,spongebob,1
"Wait, no! We've got... to get... out.",not spongebob,0
Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...,not spongebob,0
"There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked.  I propose a toast, to new friends.  Hold on a second.  I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up.",not spongebob,0
Ahhh...,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home.",spongebob,1
"Hiya, SpongeBob!  Whatcha doin'?",not spongebob,0
"Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.",spongebob,1

No!,not spongebob,0
To anybody. So I got this abrasive side to help change my personality.,spongebob,1
"Aw, SpongeBob, don't go trying to be someone you're not. You are who you are, and who you are is just fine!",not spongebob,0
Who he is just stinks!,not spongebob,0
"Golly! We've got to get this varmint off of you. Now, turn around...  and grab something heavy.  Now hold still.",not spongebob,0
"No, you don't scare me, Girly!",not spongebob,0

"Hey, what are you doing, you crazy bushy-tailed rodent?! Hey!",not spongebob,0
All done!,not spongebob,0
"Phew. Thank you, Sandy! You too, Patrick!",spongebob,1
No problem!,not spongebob,0
I think it's high time we got rid of this critter.,not spongebob,0
"So long, Abrasivey!  Grandma! I've got to apologize to Grandma!  Grandma? Hello, Grandma, I'm sorry about earlier. So, what do ya say? Can we discuss forgiveness over a cup of your famous hot cocoa?",spongebob,1
"Oh, my sweet, I would love to whip that up for you right after you...",not spongebob,0
Make your own hot cocoa! I'm busy!,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
"Oh! Pardon me, young lady.  What a fox.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, eh... I hope I don't miss again.",not spongebob,0
"Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good!  D'oh!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, sweet wampum.  Huh! Whazzat?  Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead!  So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my  arch competitor, Plankton!  For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man.  So long, shrimp!",not spongebob,0
"Curse you, Mr. Kraaaaaabs!  Ow!  Ouch!",not spongebob,0
"So, typical day of failure, I see, huh, darling?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, your majesty.",not spongebob,0
"What do we got here?  Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's as big as a whale! I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like.",not spongebob,0
Then why don't you just use that Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier thing you built last Tuesday?,not spongebob,0
"What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae.  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mr. Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!",not spongebob,0
Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.,not spongebob,0
At last!,not spongebob,0
"There you are, sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Er, um, hey there, uh, SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",not spongebob,0
"I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.",not spongebob,0
"I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!",not spongebob,0
Why- why not?,not spongebob,0
"Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!",not spongebob,0
"The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his—  I mean, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.",not spongebob,0
"But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!",not spongebob,0
Review?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes, please, sir, please!",not spongebob,0
But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work.",not spongebob,0
"But, sir!",not spongebob,0
"I thought I sent you away, cretin!",not spongebob,0
"But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!",not spongebob,0
"All right, the sauce.",not spongebob,0
Wh-what?,not spongebob,0
"The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...",not spongebob,0
"What's the matter with you? All I said was A little too much sauce. It's no big deal, really.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...",not spongebob,0
"What do you want from me, a promotion?!",not spongebob,0
A pro- a promo- a promotion?!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now.",not spongebob,0
Register!,not spongebob,0
Glad that's over.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!",not spongebob,0
Co-Cashier?!,not spongebob,0
"So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?",not spongebob,0

"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...",not spongebob,0
Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!,not spongebob,0
So what do you want me to do about it?,not spongebob,0
"I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.",not spongebob,0
Hope you like gray.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window!",not spongebob,0
"Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—",not spongebob,0
"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!",not spongebob,0
Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!,not spongebob,0
Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?,not spongebob,0
If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.,not spongebob,0
One dollar!? You hate me!,not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
You!,not spongebob,0
Me?,not spongebob,0
You think this is funny?,not spongebob,0
"In a cosmic sort of way, yes.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?!",not spongebob,0
"What? It's just an ordinary Krabby—  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Mr. Plankton] I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what now?",not spongebob,0
"A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!",not spongebob,0
I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!",not spongebob,0
"Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?",not spongebob,0
"No, sir, he's back.",not spongebob,0
Who's back? What?  What was that?!,not spongebob,0
Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!,not spongebob,0
Take cover from what?!?,not spongebob,0
He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!,not spongebob,0
What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!,not spongebob,0
Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.,not spongebob,0
He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.,not spongebob,0
He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.,not spongebob,0
"And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!",not spongebob,0
Krabs?! What the barnacles is going on here?!,not spongebob,0
"It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.",not spongebob,0
That's terrible!,not spongebob,0
Yeah! But the worst part is...,not spongebob,0
"Good grief, he's naked!",not spongebob,0
"Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!",not spongebob,0
"I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes... no service!",not spongebob,0
"Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!",not spongebob,0
I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?,not spongebob,0
"Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!",not spongebob,0
"Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!",not spongebob,0
"You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!",not spongebob,0

"What do we do, Mermaid Man?",not spongebob,0
"I'm glad you asked!  I believe that if the Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state! Does that sound about right, Professor Magma?",not spongebob,0
You'll never do it! You don't have the moxie!,not spongebob,0

"Patrick, look out, behind you!!",spongebob,1
"Excuse me, but does this come in...",not spongebob,0
Noooo! You're not my best friend!,not spongebob,0
We’ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals!,spongebob,1
"We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat.",spongebob,1
You mean like those guys?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement.",spongebob,1
Look at these guys!,not spongebob,0
"Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?",spongebob,1

There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?,spongebob,1
"Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies",not spongebob,0
Clean as a whistle!,not spongebob,0
And those who had more important things to do with their time.,not spongebob,0
That looks good to me.,not spongebob,0

"Here, I'll get it.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me.",spongebob,1

What are you saying?,spongebob,1
"Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U... R... huh... How do you spell not my friend?",not spongebob,0

Your pants are falling down.,not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
I'll fix it.,not spongebob,0
Satisfied?,spongebob,1
"There, you look good now.",not spongebob,0

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it.",spongebob,1
"No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!",not spongebob,0
"You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!",spongebob,1

"Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah?",not spongebob,0
"Booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!",spongebob,1
Gold? Heehee!,not spongebob,0
Did you get any of Patrick's gold?,not spongebob,0

"No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!",not spongebob,0
Try me!,spongebob,1
"Stay back, I'll do it!",not spongebob,0
It's too late for that!,spongebob,1
My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!,not spongebob,0
I'm covered in muck and scum!,spongebob,1
"Man, to get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!",not spongebob,0
It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!,spongebob,1
Slather toe jam on my armpits?,not spongebob,0
I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!,spongebob,1
Smear slime on my teeth?,not spongebob,0
And dry-clean my uvula!,spongebob,1

"No, Patrick, thank you.",spongebob,1
You're my best friend ever!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner.",not spongebob,0
"Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky.",not spongebob,0
"Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth.",spongebob,1
Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.,not spongebob,0
"And what is that, my son?",spongebob,1
"That re-enacting battles is really lame!  Come on, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!",not spongebob,0
Or hockey!,not spongebob,0
Or knitting fluffy sweaters!,not spongebob,0
"Come, Patrick, my work here is done.",spongebob,1
"Excuse me, miss?",spongebob,1
I don't want to have to report you again.,not spongebob,0
"I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or...",spongebob,1
I think it goes stuck inside your...,not spongebob,0
"Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad,  just in case I have to write an essay.",spongebob,1
"Good morning class. Sorry I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I...  Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder.  Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I like to kick people's butts.",not spongebob,0
"What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like.  Okay class, as you remember last week...",not spongebob,0
Hi! I'm SpongeBob!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob. I'm gonna kick your butt.",not spongebob,0
That joke was almost funnier the second time.,spongebob,1
No. I mean it.,not spongebob,0
That time it almost seemed like...  ...you did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?,spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Can I be excused for the rest of my life?,spongebob,1
"Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff.",spongebob,1
"Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats?  Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats.  Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey.  My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class.",not spongebob,0
I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One... two...  OH NO! THAT'S THREE! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's real nice.",not spongebob,0
"Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!",spongebob,1
"Hey, that story really speaks to me.",not spongebob,0
Really? What's it say?,spongebob,1
"It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard.",not spongebob,0
"...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.  Death row, next in line speaking.",spongebob,1
"Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery.",not spongebob,0
Patrick? Is that you?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double-",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!",spongebob,1
You're working at Pizza Castle now?,not spongebob,0
"What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.",spongebob,1
"No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you there?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt!  Hellllo? Is this Pizza Castle?!",not spongebob,0
"Come in, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?",spongebob,1
But why?,not spongebob,0
I can't tell you.,spongebob,1
Why ever not?,not spongebob,0
"I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.",not spongebob,0
"Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.",spongebob,1
Of course.,not spongebob,0
Flats says he's going to kick my butt!,spongebob,1
"What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine. This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me!",not spongebob,0
"Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you.",spongebob,1
"Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mrs. Puff!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a misunderstanding.",not spongebob,0
YOU WHAT?!?!?!,spongebob,1
"He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend.  And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.",not spongebob,0
I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?,spongebob,1
"Why, yes I am.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt.",spongebob,1
"Dad, what're you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, nothing, son.",not spongebob,0
What did I tell you about talking to strangers?,not spongebob,0
Now he's gonna kick my butt!,not spongebob,0
AAAAAAAHHH! OUT OF MY WAY! OUT OF MY WAY!  Can't you see he's going to kick my butt?!,spongebob,1
"Hi there, young people, nice day today.",not spongebob,0
"So, you like kicking butts, do ya?! Well, we'll show you, old man!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! BobPants SpongeSquare. Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Flats... you feeling better?",spongebob,1
What? Where am I?,not spongebob,0
"Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.",spongebob,1
"Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt.  Those flowers for me?",not spongebob,0
AAAAAAAHHH! He's still gonna kick my butt!,spongebob,1
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!",not spongebob,0
I love the young people.,not spongebob,0
"Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it!  'AHH!!! Flats!!",spongebob,1
It's butt-kicking time.,not spongebob,0
"Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is!",spongebob,1
Let's do it!,not spongebob,0
"Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly.",spongebob,1
Are you ready?,not spongebob,0
"Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles!  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of... spongy material! Do you know what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'.",spongebob,1
"Sorry I'm late, class, I...  SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student!  I'm going to kick your butt!",not spongebob,0
"Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm scared!",spongebob,1
"Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this. A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the--?!  SpongeBob, aren't you two supposed to be camping?",not spongebob,0
We are camping.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.",not spongebob,0
"Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Okay. Have fun inside.,spongebob,1
"What do you mean, have fun inside?",not spongebob,0
Just... have fun inside. See you tomorrow.,spongebob,1
Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
Don't think I can't see what you're doing!,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
You're saying I can't take it!,not spongebob,0
But all I...,spongebob,1
"AAH! You're saying I'm soft! You think your little have fun inside challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is NEVER GONNA HAPPEN! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!",not spongebob,0
Okay. Have fun inside.,spongebob,1
That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!,not spongebob,0
Squidward's gonna come camping with us!,spongebob,1
"Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.",not spongebob,0
"That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.",not spongebob,0
"It isn't put up yet, you idiots.  Huh?",not spongebob,0
Customization!,spongebob,1
GENIUS!,not spongebob,0
He's tenderizing the ground!,spongebob,1
Of course!,not spongebob,0
WRITE THAT DOWN!! WRITE THAT DOWN!,spongebob,1
"Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?",not spongebob,0
"Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.",spongebob,1
Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.,spongebob,1
Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.,spongebob,1
Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob! The deliciousness has landed!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls,  just as soon as I can get my can opener.",not spongebob,0
"But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?",spongebob,1
Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.,not spongebob,0
But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.,spongebob,1
Pretty weenie!,not spongebob,0
"All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.",not spongebob,0
"Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?",not spongebob,0
"Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one The Campfire Song Song. ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪",spongebob,1
♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪,not spongebob,0
♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪,not spongebob,0

"Squidward!  Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪  ♪OH, YEAH!!!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?",spongebob,1
No. This is relaxing!,not spongebob,0
"OH NO! I'll save you, Squidward!!!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?",spongebob,1
Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!,not spongebob,0
But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.,spongebob,1
A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  DON'T EXIST?!,not spongebob,0
What are you saying?,spongebob,1
There's no such thing! They're just a myth!,not spongebob,0
"Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real! It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer!",spongebob,1
I Married a Sea Bear?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and Fake Science Monthly!",not spongebob,0
Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!,not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...",spongebob,1
"You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?",not spongebob,0
"Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.",spongebob,1
Okay. Then what?,not spongebob,0
Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.,spongebob,1
Flashlights are their natural prey.,not spongebob,0
You're kidding.,not spongebob,0
Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
Go on.,not spongebob,0
Don't ever eat cheese.,spongebob,1
Sliced or cubed?,not spongebob,0
Cubed. Sliced is fine.,spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah, and?",not spongebob,0
Never wear a sombrero...,spongebob,1
...in a goofy fashion!,not spongebob,0
Or clown shoes.,spongebob,1
Or a hoop skirt.,not spongebob,0
And never...,spongebob,1
Ever...,not spongebob,0
Ever...,spongebob,1
Duh!,not spongebob,0
SCREECH LIKE A CHIMPANZEE!!!,not spongebob,0
Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!,not spongebob,0
They're horrible!,not spongebob,0
And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger!,not spongebob,0
Why?,not spongebob,0
I don't know...  Just a feeling!!,not spongebob,0
No.,spongebob,1
Yes.,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
U! UHUHU!,not spongebob,0
"SQUIDWARD, PLEASE DON'T!!!",not spongebob,0
Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Ah!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt.",spongebob,1
Good thinking!  All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.,not spongebob,0
"You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?",not spongebob,0
Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.,spongebob,1
"Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?",not spongebob,0
No. Like that.,spongebob,1
"Squidward, are you okay?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back.,spongebob,1
Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.,not spongebob,0
Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Don't run! Sea bears hate that!,spongebob,1
"Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.",not spongebob,0
NOOOOOOO!!!,not spongebob,0
They hate limping more than running!,spongebob,1
"Well, I guess I'll just have...",not spongebob,0
I should have warned you about crawling.,spongebob,1
What'd I do that time?!,not spongebob,0
I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.,spongebob,1
Pretend to be somebody else!!!,not spongebob,0
"Here, draw a circle.",spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
That was an oval. It has to be a circle!,spongebob,1
"Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros.",spongebob,1
What attracts them?,not spongebob,0
The sound of a sea bear attack.,not spongebob,0
"Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"Next! Oh, no...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob... what can I do for you?,not spongebob,0
The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey.,spongebob,1
Ugh. Let me see your bank book.,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing.",spongebob,1
Nice... bunnies.,not spongebob,0
"I know, I know. It's so embarrassing.  I wanted the one with the kittens on it.",spongebob,1
"Right.  Here you are, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do.",spongebob,1
"I don't think they go directly to Mermaid Man, SpongeBob. But, um. Here. Try this one.",not spongebob,0
This one... smells funny.,spongebob,1
Come on! Would ya hurry up?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, some of us have withdrawals to make, ya know?",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!",spongebob,1
"One, two, three, four...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?",spongebob,1
"No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three...",not spongebob,0
"One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please.",spongebob,1
All right!,spongebob,1
Not so fast! Where's my dollar?,not spongebob,0
"Here you are, my good sir.",spongebob,1
"Here you go, kid.",not spongebob,0
Seventeen...,not spongebob,0
So... shiny... and smooth!  Ah... oh! Oh!  Oooh! Mermaid Man's bubble-powered wheelchair from season twelve! And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever.,spongebob,1
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Those cards aren't worth nothin'. I wouldn't put those cards in the spokes of my bike. Now, if you wanna see a card worth talkin' about, check this one out. This is the super-rare platinum hologram animated talking card: number fifty-four.",not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man says:,not spongebob,0
Buy more cards!,not spongebob,0
There are only five in existence.,not spongebob,0
How much is it? For this one?,spongebob,1
"This one's just a display. If you want a real one, you'll have to buy as many packs as you can and hope you get lucky.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I have a good feeling about this one. Oh, come on. And it's... not there.  Mmm... no.  Ohhh! (close up on SpongeBob's face) I'll never find card fifty-four!",spongebob,1
"Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"No, it's just another...",spongebob,1
Mermaid Man says,not spongebob,0
Buy more cards!,not spongebob,0
Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!,spongebob,1
"It sure does the job, all right.",not spongebob,0
"Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it!",spongebob,1
I'm preventing gingivitis.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And  Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?,spongebob,1
"Yes, sir.",not spongebob,0
"I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack.  Whew! Now watch where you're going!",spongebob,1
"Okay. Thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, look out!  Ha, that was close.",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been...",spongebob,1
What?,not spongebob,0
"The card!   Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes.",not spongebob,0
Ahhh!  Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card.,spongebob,1
"Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys.  Nope.  There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere.",not spongebob,0
"The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up!  Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!",spongebob,1
"Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat.  You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?",not spongebob,0
You mean...  you'd give me your most valuable possession?,spongebob,1
I'd give you my most valuable possession?,not spongebob,0
You're the best pal ever.,spongebob,1
I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, pal. Anything for you.",spongebob,1
Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?,not spongebob,0
"Um, sure, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, wait! Let me call a locksmith.",spongebob,1
Oh! I don't need any old locksmith.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't...",spongebob,1
"Ugh!  Man, this card is fantastic!  Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card.  Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it.",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!",spongebob,1
"Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest.  There! Nice and shiny!",not spongebob,0
Patrick! The card! It's on fire!,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it.  There! Good as new!",not spongebob,0
Ew.,spongebob,1
Dinner is served.,not spongebob,0
More cards...,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot!  Hey! Look at that!  Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have.",not spongebob,0
Zzbbb... more cards...,not spongebob,0
Oh! It's ruined!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what's wrong?",not spongebob,0
"Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!",spongebob,1
Aw... sure you will.,not spongebob,0
"No. No! I spent all my money! And,  and,  and, you bought that last pack! So there's no more left in all of Bikini Bottom.",spongebob,1
"Well, how about these?",not spongebob,0
Mermaid Man says...,not spongebob,0
Buy more cards! (x4),not spongebob,0
"Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!",spongebob,1
"Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em.",not spongebob,0
May I... have one?,spongebob,1
"They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
"Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards?  I locked myself out of my house again.",not spongebob,0
"Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?",spongebob,1
"Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another.",not spongebob,0
"That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that's him!",not spongebob,0
"No, no, baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take ya!  Well, what about Squidward?",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Ahh! the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium.,not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know. But I can't take him, daddy! They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom?",not spongebob,0
"Just don't be late, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Now listen, boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it?  I made this part out of...",spongebob,1
"Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!",not spongebob,0
"Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert!  Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"What is it, Gary? What do you have?  Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea!  Long.  Tan.  Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this!",spongebob,1
"Hello?  What do you think, Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?",not spongebob,0
"Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact.  I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance...  ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.",spongebob,1
A limo! Why didn't you say so?  I love limousines!,not spongebob,0
"Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess the first thing we should do is...",spongebob,1
Yay! My first prom picture!,not spongebob,0
Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture.,spongebob,1
"Let's get this over with.  Come on, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Be right there.,spongebob,1

"Ohh, is he the really tall one?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes!  I mean... Oh no.  Oh, quick, let's go see how ugly Cindy's dress is!  SpongeBob, what are you doing?!",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!",spongebob,1
You look ridiculous!,not spongebob,0

"Get down, he'll see us! It's my ex-boyfriend, Octavius Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome!",not spongebob,0
Meep.,not spongebob,0
"Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy!",spongebob,1
Give me that back.,not spongebob,0
That just didn't happen. Let's go!  Ready?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can't you see everybody here is doing 'the whack'?",not spongebob,0
"The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one.",spongebob,1
Are you sure you can do this?,not spongebob,0
Aaah! a monster!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you've ruined everything!",not spongebob,0
"Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet!  Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry.  Whatever you do, don't...",spongebob,1
"Wow, what did you do to him? Poor little guy.",not spongebob,0
"Sponge, are you okay?",not spongebob,0
— Messed everything up.,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob, ya didn't mess everything up.",not spongebob,0
— Hot dog!,spongebob,1
"Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy's hair.",not spongebob,0
All I wanted was to have a good time!,spongebob,1
"But I am having a good time! Ya know, we haven't finished our dance yet.",not spongebob,0
Can I still wear the wig?,spongebob,1
"Yes, you can still wear the wig.",not spongebob,0
Let's go!,spongebob,1
"Get lost, pizza topping! Can't you see I'm doing the Sponge?",not spongebob,0
Get out!,not spongebob,0
"They love us! Yay, we're popular!",not spongebob,0
And don't come back!,not spongebob,0
"Go wreck someone else's prom, will ya?",not spongebob,0
"Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.",spongebob,1
"Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun.",not spongebob,0
A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower!  You almost stepped on it.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Good job, laddie.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! .",spongebob,1
Squidward. What do you think the nurse is doing to him in there?,not spongebob,0
It's called a checkup. It's an invasion of your personal space that's good for you.,not spongebob,0
"Sir, please hold still! I need to check your reflexes.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, nurse lady. I've never had a checkup before. It's so much fun!",spongebob,1
"You seem fine...physically, at least.  Congratulations. You pass.",not spongebob,0
Wow! Imagine if it was this easy to get your boating license!,spongebob,1
Eh. The world shudders at the thought.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Tentacles?!,not spongebob,0
Finally! Let's get this over with!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh...So, Boy-o...how was it in there? Anything I should be...terrified of?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, Mr. Krabs! Getting a checkup is the best! The nurse poked me  and prodded me  and jabbed me...  and pulled me  and twisted me.  And—",spongebob,1
"Okay, okay. That's enough.",not spongebob,0
You want me to what?,not spongebob,0
Ooh...,not spongebob,0
"Fill this, please.",not spongebob,0
Hmph.,not spongebob,0
Could I get a little privacy?,not spongebob,0
"Hmm...good color.  Solid line fidelity. The ink is a little thick, though.",not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
You just need to drink more water. You pass.  Is there a...Eugene Krabs?!,not spongebob,0
"Your turn, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha! Looks like the old man is scared of getting his checkup.",not spongebob,0
This is no laughing matter! Every employee must get their checkup or the restaurant will be closed under orders of the Bikini Bottom Better Business Bureau.,not spongebob,0
Not the...B.B.B.B.B!,not spongebob,0
You heard her. The...,spongebob,1
Perhaps we could reach some sort of understanding.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday.  Everybody wins!",spongebob,1
I was just gonna bribe her.,not spongebob,0
Monday works.,not spongebob,0
Yay! We get to spend the weekend together!,spongebob,1
Dodged that bullet!,not spongebob,0
He's coming!,spongebob,1
It says here the first part of Krabs' exam is the pinch test. We just need to do it in a way he doesn't know he's being tested!,not spongebob,0
Way ahead of ya!  We'll make him an offer he can't resist!,spongebob,1
Free Money Inside. Ha. Not bad.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, before he sees us!",spongebob,1
"Huh? Free money, hey?  Don't mind if I do!",not spongebob,0
Where's that money? I'm not feeling any money!,not spongebob,0
Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—,spongebob,1
A baby's cheek!,spongebob,1
Lucky that was a robot baby.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, quit fooling around!  Ow!  We need to test his ability to pinch something tough, you ninny!",not spongebob,0
"Tough, huh? Gosh, the toughest thing I can think of is...Mr. Krabs himself!",spongebob,1
Ohhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Me achin' pinchers! And I didn't even get any money!,not spongebob,0
Hee hee! A penny! It's me lucky day!,not spongebob,0
"Pinch test failed. Well, maybe he'll do better on the eye stalk test.",not spongebob,0
"Free suits? Oh, boy!",not spongebob,0
"Welcome, sir.",spongebob,1
"Step up here, and we'll begin.",spongebob,1
"Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?",spongebob,1
Just grabbing some measurements...,spongebob,1
"Sir, try to keep still.",spongebob,1
"Whoa, there! Don't you need some other measurements? I mean, how 'bout my inseam?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, no, you can put that away, sir. I'm almost done.",spongebob,1
"Aah! That's it!  Get off me, you terrible tailor!",not spongebob,0
Tell your friends about us!,spongebob,1
Not likely!,not spongebob,0
How'd he do?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he didn't make the cut.",spongebob,1
"Of course.  Up next, it says we have to get him an X-ray of him. Any ideas?",not spongebob,0
I do have one plan that might work.,spongebob,1
"Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography!  Preserve your precious punim for generations to come!  Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!",spongebob,1
"No charge, hey?  Well...I am very photogeneric.",not spongebob,0
Let's see...how do you start this thing? Oh! Here we go!,not spongebob,0
Hoo! Gettin' kinda hot in here!  Should my underwear be on fire?,not spongebob,0
How many X-rays of Mr. Krabs do we need?,spongebob,1
Just one. How many did you set it to take?,not spongebob,0
25...thousand?,spongebob,1
"Uh...this is getting a little... Eh...thank you.  No more pictures, please.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, is his skeleton supposed to just fall apart like that?",spongebob,1
Not at all. On to the next test.,not spongebob,0
"Oh...oh... Oh, what a day.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, man, you look like you've had a rough day. How'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage? It's free.",spongebob,1
"Free, huh?",not spongebob,0
Free.,spongebob,1
Eh. Okay. Let's get this over with.,not spongebob,0
"Remember,  this is the cold-blooded test. Just take his temperature.",not spongebob,0
"You got it, best friend.",spongebob,1
Don't call me that.,not spongebob,0
Boop!,spongebob,1
Don't you do that!,not spongebob,0
I'm ready!,not spongebob,0
"All right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension.",spongebob,1
"Why, you—Oh, no, no, no, no, no!",not spongebob,0
How's the cold-blooded test going?,not spongebob,0
Great! He's in the freezer right now.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you moron! Cold-blooded means your body is the same temperature as the water around it, not that you're actually cold!",not spongebob,0
Squidward? Whyyyyyy?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm so sorry! We had to give you your physical without you knowing, or the Krusty Krab would've been shut down, and I'd have to get a real job!",not spongebob,0
All right! Final test! Shell durability!,spongebob,1
"No, no, no, no, no, no!",not spongebob,0
Now you see why I don't like checkups?,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Yes, you failed every test today, but Squidward and I will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend!",spongebob,1
Let's kick it up a notch!,spongebob,1
Whoa—no!,not spongebob,0
"Oh—oh—no—oh, jeez—ohh!",not spongebob,0
"I don't know what we did wrong, Squidward. Mr. Krabs looks worse than before!",spongebob,1
I guess that nurse is gonna close the Krusty Krab after all. I wish I could say it's been a pleasure working with you.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, I'll miss you too!",spongebob,1
"Quit yer blubberin', boy. Me body may be mush, but me mind's sharp as a tack! And I...have a plan.",not spongebob,0
Good morning! I assume your boss passed his physical?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, um...yes. Of course he did. Um, unfortunately, our results were—",not spongebob,0
"Uh, eaten!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah. Um, anyway, we thought you could give old Mr. K another exam yourself. He's in his office.",not spongebob,0
Hmm...Very well.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs...not only did you pass your exam, you might be the most astonishingly excellent physical specimen I've ever seen!",not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
"My name is Mr. Krabs, and I love money!",not spongebob,0
Yes. You said so several times during the examination.,not spongebob,0
I suppose I won't need to close your restaurant today. See you next year.,not spongebob,0
"Whoo-hoo! We did it, boys! The Krusty Krab lives to see another day! Three cheers for a successful ruse!",not spongebob,0
Let's just make it one.,spongebob,1
"Hip, hip, hooray!",not spongebob,0
"So, you said there would be some money in this for me?",not spongebob,0
You'll never get me money!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, behold the migration of the majestic clams. To search for warmer climates, and plentiful food.",not spongebob,0

Hey!  The binoculars are attacking!,not spongebob,0

Oh, look at what the clams are doing to my beautiful home! SpongeBob, will you stop feeding those clams?",not spongebob,0
"Why, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Because they're making a me—  Agh! Stop!,not spongebob,0
Maybe I have been feeding these clams too much.,spongebob,1
I'll never be clean again!,not spongebob,0
♪Walking to work ain't too shabby! 'Cause I'll be whipping up a Krabby Patty!♪  Huh?,spongebob,1
"Go on home, you clams! I have to go to work now. Go on. Go home. I don't have any more Krabby Patties for you. You need to find your own food.  Okay then. I'll just—  Oh! Follow the leader!",spongebob,1
Bye! I'll see you crazy clams later.,spongebob,1
"Hey, that's mine!",not spongebob,0
What are you doing? You know it's not nice to steal other people's food!,spongebob,1
"Aw, don't worry. I see that we understand each other completely now.",spongebob,1
"No! Bad clam! Sorry, sir!",spongebob,1
Blagh.,not spongebob,0
"What am I going to do? I can't leave the clams alone. They'll just have to go to work with me. Come on, you clams!",spongebob,1
No! Not again! I just got clean!,not spongebob,0
"Remember, no stealing food.",spongebob,1
Perch here and be good clams while I work.,spongebob,1
What the barnacle is going on here? How did all these clams get inside?,not spongebob,0
I couldn't leave them outside. They were stealing people's Krabby Patties.,spongebob,1
"Well, what do you think they're doing in here?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, stealing people's Krabby Patties?",spongebob,1
"And costing me money!  Now get them out of here, boy!  Ow!",not spongebob,0
Bad clam! Don't spit pearls at nice Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
Pearls?  Ooh!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll get all these clams out of here right now.",spongebob,1
"Not so fast, SpongeBob.  What's your hurry?",not spongebob,0
Didn't you just tell me to get the clams out of here 'cause they're stealing food from your customers?,spongebob,1
"Ow! Forget the customers. If these clams keep spitting pearls at me, I'll be rich! Good clams. Good clams! Tee-hee-hee. Oh.  Bad clams! Stupid clams! Smelly clams!  Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ow!",not spongebob,0
"I've gotta get these clams out of here!  Follow me, clams.",spongebob,1

"Don't, Oh, hey, Squidward me! Not after you lured these monsters into town!  They are a menace to society and we want them out!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry the clams messed things up, but you must remember, they're wild animals.",spongebob,1
Exactly! And wild animals don't belong in a civilized town!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, maybe you're right. If you really want the clams gone, then I'll lead them out of town.",spongebob,1
"In that case, let me just say this from the heart. Give me more pearls, you stupid, smelly clams!  I'm good.",not spongebob,0
"Well, then, I guess this is good-bye.",spongebob,1
One Season Later...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the life of a clam is the best!  Brr! Getting cold out. Must be fall. I hate to say it, little clams, but it's time for you all to fly home to warmer climates.  Don't be sad. We'll see each other next year. I promise. Now go on.  The circle of life. Whelp, guess I should migrate home, too.",spongebob,1
"Well, it took me a whole season, but it's finally clean.  The clams! They're back!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait, Squidward. It's just me!",spongebob,1
Drool pool!,not spongebob,0

"Yeah, The Flying Dutchman has a beard!",not spongebob,0
"I don't look like The Flying Dutchman, because...  You morons cut off my beard!",not spongebob,0
Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger!,spongebob,1
I don't want to look younger! I hate youth! I'll probably get pimples again.,not spongebob,0
Your beard will just grow back.,not spongebob,0
You know nothing about me facial hair. It'll take a thousand years for my beard to grow back!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts.",spongebob,1
"Well, now's the time you've learned. Until my beard grows back, I'm going to turn you two fools into ghosts. Prepare to be ghostified!",not spongebob,0
Ghostified? That's not even a real word.,not spongebob,0

Invisible to the world!,not spongebob,0
Living without a soul!,spongebob,1
It's miserable!,not spongebob,0
How could anyone live like this?!,spongebob,1

Hey! We're still ghosts!,spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. The curse will wear off when my beard grows back.",not spongebob,0

"Well, I want to be on my date now! But, you knuckleheads loused that up, too!",not spongebob,0
"We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?",spongebob,1

Several months later...,not spongebob,0
"Well, here we are several months later! I wonder how the Flying Dutchman's doing on his date!",spongebob,1

H-How did you find out?,spongebob,1
"Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Or before he takes off his sleep mask.,not spongebob,0

"See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.",not spongebob,0
And why is that?,not spongebob,0
"Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!",not spongebob,0
That's not a curse.  That's a blessing.,not spongebob,0

There is a no-contract clause in it too.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?",spongebob,1
"Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'",not spongebob,0

"Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!",not spongebob,0
Give me one good reason why I should lift the curse.,not spongebob,0
"Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.",not spongebob,0
I said: give me a good reason.,not spongebob,0
"Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I like a man who begs.",not spongebob,0
"See, told ya'",not spongebob,0
"I will lift the curse, provided you two complete a dangerous task.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-",not spongebob,0
"Oh anything, Great Hagfish.",spongebob,1
Bring me the sacred gold doubloon from the throat of the Giant Golden Eel!,not spongebob,0
Okay...,not spongebob,0
"Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel.",spongebob,1
How could you tell?,not spongebob,0
She gave me its business card.,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-",not spongebob,0
...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too.,spongebob,1
"Hold it, SpongeBob, Look.",not spongebob,0
"It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up.",spongebob,1
"Good idea, be careful not to-",not spongebob,0
WOAAHHH!,spongebob,1
He's awake!,not spongebob,0
Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-,spongebob,1
...Hide behind...  WOAAAH!!!!,spongebob,1
"Morning, already.  I'm coming Mr. Krabs  Don't go anywhere!",spongebob,1
I really don't have a choice,not spongebob,0
"Take, this!",spongebob,1
Good job ladee!,not spongebob,0
We're not finished yet!  I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!  I don't got it.,spongebob,1
"Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.",not spongebob,0
Finally.  Clean free.,not spongebob,0
"Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.",not spongebob,0
"There ya' go, the curse is lifted.",not spongebob,0
A closed sign?,spongebob,1
That's it? That's the curse?!,not spongebob,0
You think I'm gonna waste good spells on a bottom-feeder like you? Have a nice day.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-",not spongebob,0
"Wha...? What happened? Where am I!?  Oh yeah, the party! I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling.  See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 8:30. Things get real crazy after 8:30!",not spongebob,0
"Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would?",spongebob,1
"Whooooo! Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge-  That's a good lookin' donut... Wow...  This donut's connected to SpongeBob! Oh...  It worked!  A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china!  The good plate.  Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear! I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before...  Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night...",not spongebob,0
A donut this nice could really make a guy happy!,spongebob,1
This is SpongeBob's delicious...  Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut...!  It's SpongeBob's!,not spongebob,0
Go on and eat it. What are you waitin' for?,not spongebob,0
Don't do it! It's SpongeBob's donut!,not spongebob,0
"Don't listen to him, he's covered with sprinkles.",not spongebob,0
...I hate conflicts!,not spongebob,0
"It couldn't get any easier than this. Just hook a chain to it,  pop it in your mouth, and then when your sponge friend wants it back, just yank it out.",not spongebob,0
"I hate to admit it, but that's a great idea!",not spongebob,0
"And now...  SpongeBob's donut, I ate it!  I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he-  Hello...?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?",spongebob,1
"That's exactly how I feel about it.  Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again.",spongebob,1
"Ah, don't watch that tape..!",not spongebob,0
"I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over.  Sheesh, Patrick's so excited, I better not keep him waiting!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut..! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing.  Whew...  Oh...",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, I-  Donut! You monster...! You monster!  Nothing goes with a video like toast! Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy!",spongebob,1
"Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow!",not spongebob,0
"Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go!",spongebob,1
...The attic!  Wait... I don't have an attic!   Oh... Ooh! I know! The attic.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Are you ready to-,spongebob,1
"I don't have anything behind my back, so don't look there!",not spongebob,0
Okay... No problem. Ready to see this?  The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy?,spongebob,1
"No!  I took it, SpongeBob! I took your donut...! I'm sorry!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick! You really need to see this video!  I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy...",spongebob,1
You mean...  This is mine?,not spongebob,0
Of course! It was your birthday!,spongebob,1
When?,not spongebob,0
"Last night, silly!",spongebob,1
"Oh... Thanks, buddy!  Hey, Wanna share it?",not spongebob,0
"Sure, pal!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, pretty good, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Alright, hold on a second there, free-loader! What are you doing here?",not spongebob,0
I'm here for lunch.,not spongebob,0
Did you bring money this time?,not spongebob,0
Yes!,not spongebob,0
"Let me see that.  Alright, tastes real. Now get in line!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, how's that new executive treatment sandwich treating you? Cause it's hitting all the quadrants of my hunger markets.",not spongebob,0
"Mmm, quadrants!",not spongebob,0
"You know, it reminds me of something I was thinking about business the other day.",not spongebob,0
The satisfaction earnings of the fourth quarter of my lunch are off the charts!,not spongebob,0
And I love the way it tastes!,not spongebob,0
"And business, my friend, is the business I'm talking about.",not spongebob,0
"Well, one can't have business without business right?",not spongebob,0
"Interesting point, Marv. How's your sandwich?",not spongebob,0
Absolutely spectacular! This new menu item is the business plan I can really get behind!,not spongebob,0
"I tell you, this is one dynamic little sandwich.",not spongebob,0
With levels of proactiveness that are off the charts. Business wise.,not spongebob,0
It really appeals to my demographic.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you are an executive in a fast-paced world of business.",not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha! That's for sure!",not spongebob,0
These guys talk funny words.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?",not spongebob,0
I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, the executive treatment.",not spongebob,0
Is that what you call it?,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wow! I'll take seven!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry.",not spongebob,0
But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the Donut and it was great! The donut is gone!  The donut is gone!,not spongebob,0
"First of all, a lot of that donut, it's still on your face!",not spongebob,0
"Now, where's my executive treatment?",not spongebob,0
"I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you  the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars.",not spongebob,0
Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?,not spongebob,0
"Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of  business glasses for additional 10 dollars.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'd be stupid not to!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you're half right.",not spongebob,0
Here's your 20 bucks.,not spongebob,0
Here's your glasses.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment, my good man.",not spongebob,0
Here's your executive treatment!,spongebob,1
Here you go.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, man!  It looks executively delicious!",not spongebob,0
"Carl, what are you doing standing around at a time like this? We're gonna be late for the big brainstorming meeting!",not spongebob,0
"But! But!  Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!",not spongebob,0
I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files.,not spongebob,0
What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!,not spongebob,0
No!  No!  No!  Not 4-B! No!,not spongebob,0
"Wow! You're very upset about conference room 4-B. And I can't say I blame you. Because conference room 4-B is the most terrifying conference room in the whole building. More people have been fired in here than all the other conference rooms combined!  Save it for the big brainstorming meeting!  Right here is where all the biggest business decisions in the business are made. Why if an impostor were to be caught in here, hmm...",not spongebob,0
He'd be given a sandwich and sent on his way?,not spongebob,0
"No, he'd be convicted as a corporate spy and sent to jail forever and ever and ever. Hey, where are you going?",not spongebob,0
I think I’ve forgot to water my manatee I'll just--?,not spongebob,0
"Gentlemen, please.",not spongebob,0
Where am I?,not spongebob,0
"Exactly. I like you, young man. Everybody scoot down and so he can sit next to me. And I won't intimidate him at all by my terrifyingly largeness and proximity. As this junior executive so eloquently put it, “Where exactly are we?”",not spongebob,0
"Ah, sir, if you take a look at this  I believe you'll agree that we’re perfectly positioned for our marketing to be number one across the business sector.",not spongebob,0
"I need a straight answer, not a bunch of meaningless charts! What do you give a disappointed stockholder to make him feel better?",not spongebob,0
A sandwich?,not spongebob,0
Get a load of this guy! A sandwich!,not spongebob,0
This guy has sandwiches on the brain!,not spongebob,0
No I don't!,not spongebob,0
That's just about the silliest piece of idea!,not spongebob,0
"Alright, hold it! Now all of you just hold it right there! It's easy to laugh and judge and heap a man with scholar when you hear an idea that stands out because it's so unusual.  So, everybody, just stop and think for a minute about what your colleague is really trying to say because I want to be the one to tell him, That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.",not spongebob,0
What if I had a meaningless chart?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, maybe I was too hasty about that.  Well, you're definitely giving a new meaning to the word “meaningless”.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait!  And here's a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean?  I guess he likes my chart, 'cause he's smiling.",not spongebob,0
He smiles like that when he's really angry.,not spongebob,0
Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?,not spongebob,0
Yes.,not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
"I don't know who you are, but you better not be an impostor. Do you know what happens to impostors in conference room 4-B?",not spongebob,0
"Well, uh, let's see. Uh, don't tell me! I-I know it's not sandwiches. They don't get sandwiches. Do they?",not spongebob,0
"Mister, this is the last straw!  Now, I'm just going to give you just 18 more chances to prove yourself.",not spongebob,0
Montage.,not spongebob,0
Jenkins!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir?",not spongebob,0
Mustache.,not spongebob,0
Here you are sir.,not spongebob,0
"And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report.",not spongebob,0
"You know, kid. We need somebody like you around here.",not spongebob,0
You do?,not spongebob,0
For me to fire!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you.  You can't fire me! I'm not an executive at all! I'm just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say!",not spongebob,0
You have a visitor.,not spongebob,0
Who is it?,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I heard you're in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. That's nice.",spongebob,1
"Yeah. Well, it's pretty nice I guess.",not spongebob,0
You know what that makes you?,spongebob,1
Nuh-uh.,not spongebob,0
An executive!,spongebob,1
"Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh! An executive treatment!,spongebob,1
What happened to prisoner 665321?,not spongebob,0
"Let's go home, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, but who are you?  No seriously. Who are you?",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"It's here! Yee-haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month!  Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day just keeps getting better!  Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!",not spongebob,0
"Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations,  now!",not spongebob,0
My mom says she wouldn't even try it. No matter how much I saw the lagoons.,not spongebob,0
"My daughter Amanda is exactly the same. It's always an argument, but I've tried to...",not spongebob,0
"Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter.",not spongebob,0
Excuse me?,not spongebob,0
"Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from.",not spongebob,0
Hey! Creepy squirrel! What's with all the eavesdropping?,not spongebob,0
"Take a hike, mammal!",not spongebob,0
Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably furrowed.,not spongebob,0
I gotta find new subjects.,not spongebob,0
Who won't mind being observed.,not spongebob,0
Eureka!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's my line!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?",not spongebob,0
Ooh! I could use a mint! (Rubs his tummy) Mmm!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology.",not spongebob,0
That doesn't sound tasty.,not spongebob,0
What do we have to do?,spongebob,1
It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal.,not spongebob,0
Act normal?,spongebob,1
Yeah. Just do what you naturally do.  Be natural. Starting... now!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, natural greeting to you, friend.",spongebob,1
Natural greeting returned.,not spongebob,0
Would you like to have some natural fun?,spongebob,1
"Oh, yes. Please.",not spongebob,0
Naturally.,spongebob,1
Aww. Alright. Experiment's done.,not spongebob,0
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?,spongebob,1
"Hey, did we do good?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, can I have an A plus?",spongebob,1
Oh! Oh! Yeah!  I want an A plus too!,not spongebob,0
Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?,not spongebob,0
Pretty please with sugar on top?,spongebob,1
"Yes, yes. You both get an A plus.",not spongebob,0
Whoo!,spongebob,1
I knew it!,not spongebob,0
Subjects acting natural. Resume observation.,not spongebob,0
We got an A plus!,spongebob,1
A plus! A plus! A plus!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, forget it.",not spongebob,0
"When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm...",not spongebob,0
Double eureka!,not spongebob,0
That's our line!,not spongebob,0
Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?,not spongebob,0
"Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or, or expose us to gamma rays?",spongebob,1
Yeah?,not spongebob,0
It's a guaranteed A plus.,not spongebob,0
Oh! It's like a dream!,not spongebob,0
Okay. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?,not spongebob,0
Easy sneezy!,spongebob,1
Ew.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.",not spongebob,0
Then off you go.,not spongebob,0
Time to get to work.,not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
Sandy!,spongebob,1
We're back!,spongebob,1
"Good job, fellers!",not spongebob,0
We're an awesome team!,not spongebob,0
"We sure are, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Okay, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount? Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later.",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, Captain Sandy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, and, Patrick, you're in charge.",not spongebob,0
All systems check.,not spongebob,0
"Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?",spongebob,1
I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.,not spongebob,0
"So what's it gonna be, boss?",spongebob,1
"Uh, the first one?",not spongebob,0
You're in charge.,spongebob,1
I'm in charge.,not spongebob,0
One.,spongebob,1
Ahem.,spongebob,1
I'm in charge.,not spongebob,0
Two.,not spongebob,0
Three.,spongebob,1
I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.,not spongebob,0
Forty-seven. Forty-seven?,spongebob,1
Uh. Huh? What?,not spongebob,0
Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven.,spongebob,1
I don't know if I wanna do it this way.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, boss man. How do you wanna do it?",spongebob,1
Uh...,not spongebob,0
How about you count the white and I count the black sand?,spongebob,1
"Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.",not spongebob,0
"Forty-eight, forty-... nine,  Oh! Oh, fifty!",not spongebob,0
"One, two, three, four, five. six,...",spongebob,1
"Seven, eight, nine, ten.",not spongebob,0
Time to initiate the first variable. One big bowl. One small bowl. Exactly eight ounces per bowl.  Free ice cream! Free ice cream! One day only! Get your free ice cream!,not spongebob,0
Oh boy! Let's go!,not spongebob,0
You're the boss!,spongebob,1
Free ice cream!,not spongebob,0
Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, boys! How'd ya like a nice free bowl of tootsie frootsie ice cream?",not spongebob,0
Okey-dokey!,not spongebob,0
"One free ice cream, please?",not spongebob,0
All sold out. Maybe I'll get some later.,not spongebob,0
Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!,not spongebob,0
Do you wanna trade?,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
You got more ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big.",spongebob,1
"Well, I wanna trade back!",not spongebob,0
There's only one fair thing to do.,not spongebob,0
What's that?,spongebob,1
"Patrick, you call that fair?",spongebob,1
I'm in charge!,not spongebob,0
Uh... Oh. Yeah.,spongebob,1
"Time for variable two. More free ice cream here! Now, with same sized cones!",not spongebob,0
Huh? I just got my slippers on!,not spongebob,0
Here ya go!,not spongebob,0
I'll take those my good man.,not spongebob,0
"But, Patrick, I...",spongebob,1
I'm in charge.,not spongebob,0
"One cone, please?",not spongebob,0
All gone!,not spongebob,0
For the love of Pete!,not spongebob,0
Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?,spongebob,1
Hmmm...  Rub my feet first!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come on!",spongebob,1
Who's in charge?,not spongebob,0
"Alright, I'll rub your feet.",spongebob,1
Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!,spongebob,1
Oh... I'll fix that.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you are making very poor choices!",spongebob,1
Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now count that bucket of white sand.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, I will!",spongebob,1
"One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three.",spongebob,1
Done! Now to count the black sand.,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's a pity.",not spongebob,0
Looks like you'll have to start over.,not spongebob,0
"Aaaah!  Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Yes, I am.",not spongebob,0
Would you like sprinkles on it?,spongebob,1
Hey!,not spongebob,0
Jeepers! I didn't see that comin'!,not spongebob,0
You're not leaving until I say so!,not spongebob,0
Sandy to Gary! Sandy to Gary! How serious is the situation?,not spongebob,0
"Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I didn't think this all the way through! I've gotta shut this down!",not spongebob,0
Ah-ha!,not spongebob,0
I want my free...,not spongebob,0
Open the door! The experiment is over!  Open the door!,not spongebob,0
You heard Sandy! Open the door!,not spongebob,0
You open it!,spongebob,1
"No, you open it!",not spongebob,0
"No, you open it!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!",not spongebob,0
It's me! Sandy!,not spongebob,0
The experiment is over!,not spongebob,0
But we didn't even finish counting the sand!,spongebob,1
I didn't care about the sand! I just wanted to observe you acting naturally. So I hid microphones and cameras around your house...,not spongebob,0
Cameras?,not spongebob,0
"Et tu, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
I was a monster! I deserve a Z minus!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk.",spongebob,1
I blame science! Stupid science!,not spongebob,0
Everybody gets an A plus and ice cream!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!",spongebob,1
What is going on?,not spongebob,0
"I know it's a stupid question, but is there any ice cream left?",not spongebob,0
Sorry. We're all out.,not spongebob,0
You ate it all?! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?!  There's gotta be some left in here!,not spongebob,0
Now let the real experiment begin.,not spongebob,0
"Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!",not spongebob,0
"Welcome, sports fans, to the 21st annual Bikini Bottom Fry Cook Games.",not spongebob,0
I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!,not spongebob,0
I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!,not spongebob,0
"So begin the 21st Fry Cook Games. I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum.",not spongebob,0
They come from everywhere microwaves hum.,not spongebob,0
Patties sizzle.,not spongebob,0
And heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm... and soggy. But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
Who could forget the year Mr. Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?,not spongebob,0
Not Plankton.,not spongebob,0
Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine... with a broken antenna?,not spongebob,0
Krabs wasn't moved.,not spongebob,0
"And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life.",not spongebob,0
"This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.,spongebob,1
To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!,spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!,spongebob,1
Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under...  …neath it!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games.",spongebob,1
Games? Can I play?,not spongebob,0
"Ah, sorry, Patrick.",spongebob,1
You have to be a fry cook.,spongebob,1
Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!,not spongebob,0
What do you mean easy?,spongebob,1
How hard can it be?,not spongebob,0
They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!,spongebob,1
"Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!",spongebob,1
Tssss...,not spongebob,0
"Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!",spongebob,1
"Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.",not spongebob,0
You take that back!,spongebob,1
Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!,not spongebob,0
You don't even have fingernails.,spongebob,1
I cannot believe what I am hearing!,not spongebob,0
How can you hear it?! You don't have ears either!,spongebob,1
Holes! Holes!,not spongebob,0

I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!,not spongebob,0
Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!,spongebob,1
What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!,not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah?! Well, I smell... Pew! He's right.",not spongebob,0
I love messing things up.,not spongebob,0
"Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.",not spongebob,0
"Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick...  ...your carapace!",not spongebob,0
"That's what you think, but I got me a champion-- SpongeBob! Show him!  Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!",not spongebob,0
"That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion.  Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!  Other way!  Imbeciles.  And... stop! Perfect.  Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium.",not spongebob,0
I gotta get outta here!,not spongebob,0
"Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of...  ...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant...  ...Patrick Star!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook.",spongebob,1
"Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.",not spongebob,0
Check it out!,not spongebob,0
I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust.",spongebob,1
Nuh-uh. I'm eating my own dust!,not spongebob,0
Not if I eat it first!,spongebob,1
Yellow!,not spongebob,0
Pink!,spongebob,1
"I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend.",spongebob,1
"Friend? Not in here, he ain't.",not spongebob,0
What do you mean?,spongebob,1
He's not really your friend.,not spongebob,0
He's not?,not spongebob,0
He's plotting your downfall right now!,not spongebob,0
He is?,spongebob,1
He's gonna stab you in the back.,not spongebob,0
He wouldn't!,not spongebob,0
Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!,not spongebob,0
He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?,not spongebob,0
No!,spongebob,1
Then get mean!,not spongebob,0
I'm mean!,not spongebob,0
Get angry!,not spongebob,0
I'm angry!,spongebob,1
Now get out there!,not spongebob,0
And win...,not spongebob,0
That...,not spongebob,0
Medal!,not spongebob,0
Ahhh.,not spongebob,0
"Our first event, the deep fry pole vault.",not spongebob,0
Win this one for the Krusty Krab.,not spongebob,0
For the Krusty Krab!,spongebob,1
Win this one because I told you to.,not spongebob,0
Because you told me to!,not spongebob,0
Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!,not spongebob,0
The next event: the chocolate high dive.,not spongebob,0
"Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.",not spongebob,0
"And now, absolute silence.",not spongebob,0
I scream for ice cream!,spongebob,1
Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.,not spongebob,0
He stuck it!,not spongebob,0
And just look at that even coating.,not spongebob,0
"Top that, Pinky.",spongebob,1
"Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!",not spongebob,0
Better than you!,not spongebob,0
Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!,not spongebob,0
Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.,not spongebob,0
Just look at that concentration.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.",not spongebob,0
But just look at that form!,not spongebob,0
"Take that, yellow boy!",not spongebob,0
"Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.",spongebob,1
"That's what you think, but it's not over yet.",not spongebob,0
"It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?",not spongebob,0
"Don't forget, he called ye yellow.",not spongebob,0
Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?,not spongebob,0
"Don't forget, he called you pink!",not spongebob,0
Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.,not spongebob,0
No! My name's... not... Rick!,not spongebob,0
I don't like you!,spongebob,1
I don't like you more!,not spongebob,0
I never liked you!,spongebob,1
I a thousand times never liked you!,not spongebob,0
Pink!,spongebob,1
Yellow!,not spongebob,0
Yellow?,spongebob,1
Pink?,not spongebob,0
You do care!,not spongebob,0
"Let's promise never to fight again, buddy.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, pal. Let's go home.",not spongebob,0
Hey! Where ya going?,not spongebob,0
Get back here and kill each other!,not spongebob,0
You're my best friend ever.,not spongebob,0
"You too, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"You know, these were white when I bought 'em.",not spongebob,0
"I suggested having this lesson in the cemetery because I thought you couldn't kill anyone here, but now I'm afraid you're disturbing the dead!",not spongebob,0
"Before they bury me, get me to a payphone.",not spongebob,0
I need to call another instructor for you. I just...can't...take it anymore!,not spongebob,0
Huh? You stopped in front of the prison? Never mind! Any place is better than in this boat with you!,not spongebob,0
What are ya waiting for? Step on it!,not spongebob,0
You must be the new driving instructor.,spongebob,1
"Student driver. That's me. I just don't take a bad picture, do I?",spongebob,1
"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm your new driving instructor.",not spongebob,0
Great! Look how I can tune the radio.,spongebob,1
Breaking news!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Notorious criminal, Stickyfins Whiting, has just escaped from prison.",not spongebob,0
"Very good radio tuning skills. Now, drive as fast as you can!",not spongebob,0
Stop! SpongeBob! Come back!  I can't believe I said that!,not spongebob,0
"Stickyfins, where are you? I can't be that late.",not spongebob,0
Follow that sponge!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you ain't Stickyfins.",not spongebob,0
"And you ain't a chocolate cake! Now, step on it!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, ma'am! Dorsal Dan at your service!",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Crater-face! We're being followed! Lose that tail!,not spongebob,0
I thought it'd made me look cool.  Guess not.,spongebob,1
Not that tail! The cops behind us! Drive crazy!,not spongebob,0
"Ohhhhh, that I can do!",spongebob,1
Wow! He's driving like a psycho! Who taught him how to drive?,not spongebob,0
Good baby?,spongebob,1
Waaaaaahhhhh!,not spongebob,0
Gosh!,not spongebob,0
"I say, how's my automobiling?",spongebob,1
Simply smashing.  You're simply smashing into things!,not spongebob,0
Let's see what's on the menu!  Oh! I'll take those!,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me sir, I'm in the middle of a driving lesson!",spongebob,1
"Look out, you maniac!",not spongebob,0
You're going the wrong way! Turn this thing around!,not spongebob,0
You got it! Turning around!,spongebob,1
"Oh, you're a great instructor! What now?",spongebob,1
Just...go with the flow.,not spongebob,0
"Looks like they shook us. Don't worry, we'll find them.",not spongebob,0
They'll probably revoke my teacher's license for this.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm a teacher too! I teach all kinds of things. Safe cracking, burglary, getaway driving.",not spongebob,0
I did notice you're a very good driver.,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, you ain't such a bad passenger yourself.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, my!",not spongebob,0
Here's your next test. Follow me.,not spongebob,0
Distracted drivers are dangerous. I want you to distract that salesman in the store.,not spongebob,0
I don't understand how this is gonna help with my driving.,spongebob,1
"It's, uh...abstract thinking.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, I've heard of that!",spongebob,1
Welcome!,not spongebob,0
Distract with the abstract.,spongebob,1
"Hey, shapes and noises! I love it!",not spongebob,0
What's the next lesson?,spongebob,1
The nearest electronic store.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy.",spongebob,1
Help! Help! I've been robbed!,not spongebob,0
"I've shopped in that place before, and I've been robbed too.",not spongebob,0
"What now, beautiful?",not spongebob,0
I wouldn't mind seeing you navigate a four-way stop.,not spongebob,0
Romance always has the right of way.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, my!",not spongebob,0
Ah! Wha— Oop.  Whoa!,spongebob,1
I need to launder these bills—fast!,not spongebob,0
"I know just the place! But first, let me adjust your seat.",spongebob,1
Ooh!  Hey! What's the big idea?,not spongebob,0
What is wrong with you?,not spongebob,0
I think your sponge should be around here somewhere.,not spongebob,0
I didn't even feel you slow down. You've got such a gentle foot on the pedal.,not spongebob,0
Gosh. No one's ever said I had a gentle foot before.,not spongebob,0
Oh—ho.  Oh! Oh!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Why's that jerk honking? Go! Drive!,not spongebob,0
Sorry about your gentle foot! Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
Hey—Owww!,not spongebob,0
"Oh! Ooh, driving range!",spongebob,1

Doh!  Doh—doh—doh—doh—doh—,not spongebob,0
"Doh! That kinda hurts, don't ya think?",spongebob,1

"For the love of Neptune, let's get outta here!",not spongebob,0
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh!  Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
"Ah!  Ha, ha!",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Ow!  Oh!,not spongebob,0
Ooh—ow!,not spongebob,0
I just wanna know...what'd I ever do to deserve this?,not spongebob,0
"Would you like to test me on road signs now? Let's see...  Stop, No Left Turn, and that one over there that says Falling Rocks!",spongebob,1
"Wait, what?  Ooh!  Oof!",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff!,spongebob,1
Stickyfins!,not spongebob,0
Dorsal Dan! Help meeeee!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mrs. Puff! The new instructor's been teaching me so much. Not as much as you. But y'know, different things.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you gotta keep your eyes on the road!",not spongebob,0
He hasn't taught me that one yet!  Oh!,spongebob,1
Ah! Get me outta here!,not spongebob,0
"Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks.",spongebob,1
This is the police. Pull over!,not spongebob,0
Right turn! Make a right turn!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, professor!",spongebob,1
"Yes! I'm back!  Thank Neptune! Don't let me out ever again! It's not safe out there! Lock me away! Forever, and ever!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Warden, I found this one pulling up outside the prison.",not spongebob,0
Dorsal Dan! The notorious getaway driver. Toss him in the clink!,not spongebob,0
"I'll wait for you, my little tenderfoot!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, where'd the new instructor go? Oh, well, I still have ten minutes left on my driving lesson.  Oh, Mrs. Puff?",spongebob,1
I'll confess to anything! Throw away the key! It's not safe out here! Let me in!,not spongebob,0
"Drive safely, and always wear your seat belt!",not spongebob,0
Grandma! No!,not spongebob,0
"Get her, Grandma!  I'm the ghost of Plankton! Wooo!  Hey, that gives me an idea.  Hmm, if I were a ghost, I could walk right through the walls of the Krusty Krab and take the Krabby Patty secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"Ah! All right, that's it! You ruined another movie night with your secret formula garbage.  I'm pulling the plug.",not spongebob,0
Ah. Let's see. Now all I need to do is invent a...  Ghost extracting machine!,not spongebob,0
"I look like I just saw a ghost.  Success!  You gotta give up the ghost if you wanna make toast.  What?!  No, no, no! Stupid ghost hands!  What?  What's so funny? Stupid ghost!",not spongebob,0
"You are, that's what. You can't just float in on your first day and pick things up.  Here you go.  Oh, grab it.  Grab it! Get it!",not spongebob,0
I can't grab it!,not spongebob,0
"I like you, squirt. I got a soft spot in me heart of thieves  I can teach you how to pick things up.",not spongebob,0
I love you.,not spongebob,0
"But first, you need to learn the basics of being a ghost.",not spongebob,0
First lesson... Shape-shifting.  Shape-shifting is one of the easiest things a ghost can do. You just have to think of a horrible thing and poof!  You become it!,not spongebob,0
"Now, you try.",not spongebob,0
I did it!,not spongebob,0
That's not horrible! What were you thinking?!  Bad ghost! Bad!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Now, that's horrible!",not spongebob,0
"Now, can you teach me how to pick things up?",not spongebob,0
"Not yet.  Next lesson, scaring.  Pay close attention, squirt. This is how you scare someone.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, my turn!  Shh. Someone's coming.  Watch me scare this dummy real good.",not spongebob,0
"Well, you scared yourself. I guess that counts.  Next lesson.  Haunting houses.  All right, pupil, it's time to apply all you've learned and frighten this guy's legs off.",not spongebob,0
With pleasure.,not spongebob,0
"Who's there? Ohh, is that you, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oooh. Monster mouth with a bucket of ghost goo—very good marks.  Nice haunt, swabby!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what a terrible nightmare. Oh, thanks for being here, Clarry. You'll keep the monsters away.",not spongebob,0
Give me that!,not spongebob,0
Clarry!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I picked something up! I can pick things up!",not spongebob,0
Look at you. You skipped ahead to the last lesson!,not spongebob,0
It's okay. You don't have to—,not spongebob,0
"Last lesson! How to pick things up.  As you discovered, to pick things up, you gotta get  really angry!",not spongebob,0
"Why didn't you say that before in the first place, moron?!",not spongebob,0
I have nothing left to teach you.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah?",not spongebob,0
My boy.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm really angry! Here we go!  Yup!  Blasted bottle! It's always something!  What?",not spongebob,0
"Guess you didn't think that one through all the way, did ya?",not spongebob,0
"Dead jerk.  Well, I'm calling it. This ghost racket is for the birds. I'm going back to my body where I belong. Hmph!  Huh? I don't remember leaving the lights on.  Wha—huh?!  Yeesh. You can't leave your own carcass alone for ten minutes in this town!",not spongebob,0
"And now, if anyone has anything nice to say about Sheldon, this would be the time.",not spongebob,0
"Um, Plankton was small and... And green and loud!",spongebob,1
"All right, come on. It's okay.",not spongebob,0
Yeesh. This is the worst funeral of mine I've ever been to.  But watch these idiots scream when I get back into my body and jump out of that coffin.,not spongebob,0
"Ya can't go back in your body now. You're dead, ya dodo!",not spongebob,0
"I'm not dead. I'm just a temporary ghost. My body is in suspended animation, that's all.",not spongebob,0
"You mean, this is an empty vessel? I haven't possessed a body in years!",not spongebob,0
You can't do that! That's my body!,not spongebob,0
Not anymore!  Rarg! I'm alive! It's great to be back!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Ta-da!,not spongebob,0
Plankton's alive? Hooray!,spongebob,1
I knew it!,not spongebob,0
He's alive?!,not spongebob,0
Let's squash him!,not spongebob,0
"♪Dee, dee, dee, dee, da, da, dee, dee, dee, da!♪  Wuh-oh.  Eh? Reowr?",not spongebob,0
Oh! I can't watch them do that to me!,not spongebob,0
"Here! Take it!  Those people are angry. Whew! I never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather be a dead me than an alive you. Bye!",not spongebob,0
My body feels great!,not spongebob,0
There he is!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, everybody.  Uh, who wants to hear a ghost story, huh?  Anyone?  You know something?  Ooh! It's great to be alive.  Ouch!  Ha, ha!",not spongebob,0
The end!,not spongebob,0
Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day! Best Friends Day!,not spongebob,0

"Patrick, I am truly honored and...",spongebob,1
"What's wrong, buddy?",not spongebob,0
"You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that.",spongebob,1
"Greetings. I am Robo 2.1, your personal robot servant. I am proficient in providing over 250,000 creature comforts. Would you care for a pastry?",not spongebob,0
"Yum! Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift!",not spongebob,0
"Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.",spongebob,1
"Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now! Come on, Robo!",not spongebob,0
"Coming, Master Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say goodbye to Gummy, do you?",not spongebob,0
"No, not at all.",spongebob,1
"Thanks. Goodbye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear?  I love you, too, Gummy.  Welp, he's all yours!",not spongebob,0
"O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you.  Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this! With a little karate! Hyah!  Whew! Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza.  Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick.",spongebob,1
You're...not... Patrick...!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go!  Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?",not spongebob,0
It appears that he is throwing Gummy away.,not spongebob,0
What? Is that true?,not spongebob,0
"No way, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Then how do you explain this?,not spongebob,0
"Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up!  Isn't this a cute look?",spongebob,1
"Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob! Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast.  Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Ahhh...!,spongebob,1
What are you doing?  I'm waiting.,not spongebob,0
"Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy, 'cause he is so attractive!  Allow me to demonstrate.  See, Patrick? The view is beautiful down here!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking up there? Alrighty, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?",not spongebob,0
"'Twill be my pleasure, master.",not spongebob,0
"By the way, your house looks a million times better!",not spongebob,0
"Thanks.  Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous!",spongebob,1
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"Wishful thinking, Gary. What burglar would want to steal that thing?  Shhh.",spongebob,1
Who are you? Where did you come from?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, up there?",spongebob,1
"Oh, thank Neptune! Hey, guys, I found a way out! Come on!  I'm free! I'm free! I'm sugar-free!  At last!",not spongebob,0
"What in tarnation?  Oh my gosh! SpongeBob! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob, open up!",not spongebob,0
Sandy?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy. Looks like I got myself into a pretty sticky situation.",spongebob,1
"Oh my gosh! How long've you been stuck there, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
All day.,spongebob,1
"Well, your ol' pal Sandy know how to cut you down.",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's just crazy talk. Hiyah!",not spongebob,0
Told ya.,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like... me!",spongebob,1
"Oh, come on now, there's gotta be a way.  I've got an idea.  Hang on tight, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, alrighty.",spongebob,1
"Come on, Ol' Blue! Don't you talk back to me! Do as your told! Do it!  Do it! Do it! Come on now, do it! Come on!",not spongebob,0
"What the...? Just let it go, Squidward. Let it go. Don't get involved, Squidward.  Of course.",not spongebob,0
I'm okay!,not spongebob,0
"What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?",not spongebob,0
"It's-it's...it's amazing! It's like a gummy wonderland! Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I have something to tell you.",spongebob,1
"Would you care for a massage, Master?",not spongebob,0
"Enough already! Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, well, how can I put this?",spongebob,1
"Aw, just come right out and...  Will you stop? Just stop!",not spongebob,0
"Get on with it, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Wrap it up.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me! I-I-I mean, your Gummy.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?",spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?",spongebob,1
Yes!,not spongebob,0
"It's yours, buddy. But first, you gotta get us out of this.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's easy!  Told you it was easy.  Wow! This is the best Best Friends Day ever!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you've sampled every flavor we have. Will you please just pick one?!",not spongebob,0
"Mm-mmm! Not so fast. I would now like to sample combinations of flavors, and I would like to use my spoon!",not spongebob,0
Security. We have a sample mooch at the counter.,not spongebob,0
Wow. I can't believe Goofy Goobers employees get to eat all the ice cream they want on this job.,not spongebob,0
Hmm?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but the rule is only on the first break. And for lunch,  and on the second break, and for dinner.",not spongebob,0
Wow! Ice cream all day!,not spongebob,0
Ice cream all day. All day. All day. All day.,not spongebob,0
Ice cream all day?  I'm getting a job at Goofy Goober!,not spongebob,0
Goofy Goober's and you.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, and welcome! As a new Goofy Goober employee, we'd like you to know that we appreciate you.  The story of our ice cream begins with our founder, Reginald Goober.  Who for some unexplained reason was nicknamed Goofy.  In 1842, he headed West in a covered ice cream wagon. In the days before cones and refrigeration,  he served warm ice cream on rocks and sticks.  From those humble beginnings, Goofy Goober has grown into a multibillion dollar business  that you, our newest employee, now have the privilege to work for.  We only ask that you, one, practice good hygiene,  two, maintain good work habits,  and three, believe in extraterrestrials.",not spongebob,0
"Peace, hugs, and ice cream!",not spongebob,0
The end.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Goofy newbie.",not spongebob,0
Can I have my ice cream now?,not spongebob,0
Not until your first break.  I'm your manager and I want you to know that I appreciate you. Now let's get you started.  You will be washing dishes today.  What do you think of that?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I had a thought once.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, you sure put the Goofy in Goober! I'll check on you in a few minutes.",not spongebob,0
Exceptional! Show me how you cleaned all these dishes so fast.,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
Never tell anyone you did that.,not spongebob,0
Is it time for my first break?,not spongebob,0
Not yet.,not spongebob,0
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"This should be easy.  Just unload the boxes of ice cream from the truck, and stack them in the freezer. Okay, repeat it back to me.",not spongebob,0
"When the bell rings, I peel a banana and run like the devil.",not spongebob,0
"Uh. Eh, close enough.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, good, good! The truck is empty.  That's hot!",not spongebob,0
Nothing's biting today.,not spongebob,0
"Newbie, why would you turn the heat on in the freezer?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it was freezing in there, and the fire I built wasn't doing it.",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Now, this should be easy for you. You just walk around as Goofy the Goober and wave to the kids. But a warning—Sometimes the kids get a little over-affectionate.",not spongebob,0
"I love you, Goofy Goober!",not spongebob,0
So cute. Good luck!,not spongebob,0
I want you to be my daddy!,not spongebob,0
I want to crack this nut!,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
Oh. Unattended ice cream.  Mustn't let it go to waste.,not spongebob,0
I think you better go home and clean up.,not spongebob,0
But I haven't had my first ice cream break!,not spongebob,0
"I'll give you another chance tomorrow. If it doesn't work out, I'm afraid you're fired... in a most appreciative way.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, mister. I thought this was my rock.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, this is your rock. I was waiting for you. How was your first day at work?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I can't do anything right. I'll probably get fired tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you poor little sea star. Tell you what, buddy—Tomorrow, I'll come with you to work and help out.",spongebob,1
"Oh, thanks, kind stranger!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, tell me for the gajillionth time, how is this gonna work?",not spongebob,0
"I'll show you.  If you put arm arms behind you, I can be your hands.",spongebob,1
"Ooh, so when I scoop ice cream—",not spongebob,0
I'll do the scoopin'.,spongebob,1
And when I give change—,not spongebob,0
I'll do the countin'.,spongebob,1
And when my butt itches—,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I'm not doing that.",spongebob,1
"Okay, ready for your second, and last chance?  Let me show you how to make—",not spongebob,0
Ice cream sandwiches?  I think I got this.,not spongebob,0
Time for my first break?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, no, no. Not yet, not yet.  But I think you're ready for the big time.  All right, kid. Relax, don't choke, and try to have fun.",not spongebob,0

"Great job, newbie. Now you can take your first break.",not spongebob,0
My break? I can eat ice cream now?,not spongebob,0
All you can handle.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for your help, buddy. Now, let's dig in.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'd love to.  But if I don't hurry, I'll be late for my job. Sure you can handle that ice cream all... by yourself?  Silly question.  Good luck, my employed pal.",spongebob,1
Oh! Only two more minutes for my break! And two more minutes for ice cream!,not spongebob,0

You are fired!,not spongebob,0

"La da de, la da dum, la da doo. La da dee. Ah, it's a great day for the art world.  Famous art critic Fredrick T. Nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. I love hearing myself talk.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Squid...  Whoa!  I love your hat.",spongebob,1
Don't touch it! And it's not a hat. It's a beret.,not spongebob,0
"A beret? Oh, where can I get one?",spongebob,1
"Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi.",not spongebob,0
You're an artist?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, I'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?",not spongebob,0
We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  I made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  And I also made this cute little scallop house.,spongebob,1
"And I made this wallet,  and I crocheted money to go in it.",spongebob,1
"So, you've been counterfeiting currency? And what's doorknob number two been up to?",not spongebob,0
"I've been making baskets, too.  Darn! This hammer is defective.",not spongebob,0
"Do you want to make crafts, too?",spongebob,1
Crafts?  This isn't summer camp. I am a true artiste.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, man. I'll never make art like you and...Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, don't be sad. You can be an artist, too. I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set.  Now let me see. Oh, this'll be perfect! Now, start with a rock...",spongebob,1
Uh.,not spongebob,0
A little glue...,spongebob,1
Uh.,not spongebob,0
Stick on a couple of googly eyes...,spongebob,1
"Whoa. Slow down, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
And presto: A rock with googly eyes!,spongebob,1
Whoa. I did not see that coming!,not spongebob,0
Now you try!,spongebob,1
I'm scared.,not spongebob,0
You can do this!,spongebob,1

"Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  Witness La Visti Squidward! Stunning, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
My considered opinion is Eww! I'll have to confiscate your artist beret.,not spongebob,0
"What? No! No, you can't do that!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, but I'm looking for a real artist!",not spongebob,0
I'm an artist! Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"An artist, eh?",not spongebob,0
"No, wait, come back!",not spongebob,0
"Now, which one of you two is the artiste?",not spongebob,0

Don't judge me!,not spongebob,0
"Holy guacamole frijoles! It's so, so, primitive and naïve! You're a genius!",not spongebob,0
Is that good?,not spongebob,0
I'll give you 500 bucks for it! And this hat!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
"You are a master artist, my friend",not spongebob,0
You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!,not spongebob,0
Who's the critic here?,not spongebob,0
"Wow! Did you hear that, Squidward? Patrick is an artist!",spongebob,1
"Oh, , selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!",not spongebob,0
"How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Well, about...Um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!",not spongebob,0
"#160;: Hey there, I noticed your hat. Are you an artist?",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Do you have any art? I have a real craving for creativity!,not spongebob,0
Um...okay!  Art!,not spongebob,0
"Thanks, man! Here's fifty bucks!",not spongebob,0
I'll bet he never sells another!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Ted! Where'd you get that art?",not spongebob,0
From that pink genius over there!,not spongebob,0
I want to buy one!,not spongebob,0
Me too!,not spongebob,0
I also!,not spongebob,0
I'll bet,not spongebob,0

"So long my dear, earnest, yet untalented friend!  One for you! And one for you! And one for...  I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!",not spongebob,0
Got anything else?,not spongebob,0
"Um, the artist needs alone time!",not spongebob,0
He's so eccentric!,not spongebob,0
"I'm all out of rocks! What am I going to do now? That was my thing! Oh!  Tartar sauce!  That stinks, too!  The artist needs a lunch break!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, not you again! May I take your order?",not spongebob,0
Um! Uh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
One Krabby Patty,not spongebob,0
But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable!,not spongebob,0
"Then, what do you want?",not spongebob,0
I don't know! I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!,not spongebob,0
"Hiya, Patrick! Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?",spongebob,1
"Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick, that's terrible..",spongebob,1
Just order already!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I want new ideas to satisfy a public hunger for my goodly goods!",not spongebob,0
Off the menu! Choose something off the menu! We don't serve artistic advice here!,not spongebob,0
"Well, then, why is it on the menu?",not spongebob,0
Huh? What?,not spongebob,0
"Get back to work, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"In case you haven't noticed,  this is not an artist hat!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you can borrow mine!",not spongebob,0
Beautiful.,not spongebob,0

This is Mr. Tentacles. He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!,spongebob,1
Mm-hmm!,not spongebob,0
Mm-hmm. Pleasure!,not spongebob,0
Here's your Krabby Patty!  Shall I put it on your tab?,spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah. Keep it open. We might be here all night! Let me just say up front, I'm a fan! I'm excited to learn from a master. My career in self-worth are in your hands! Let us writing on this. Okay... advise!",not spongebob,0
Why don't you just concentrate on your patty?,not spongebob,0
"Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do!",not spongebob,0
Brilliant!  I've never seen such an example of raw creativity! This will turn the art world on its head! I hereby declare this the next big thing!,not spongebob,0
"You did it, Patrick! You found your inspiration!",spongebob,1
And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!,not spongebob,0
"You got it, buddy!",spongebob,1
"Huh?  Ooh, money! Money, money, money, money, money, money, money!  What the?  SpongeBob!  Patrick!  What's the meaning of this?",not spongebob,0
"It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50.",not spongebob,0
Ha and ha!,not spongebob,0
"Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!",not spongebob,0
"What?!  It was your idea, huh?",not spongebob,0
Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases.,spongebob,1
"Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!",not spongebob,0
It's so inexpensive!,not spongebob,0
"And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!",not spongebob,0
It's such an honor to meet you!,not spongebob,0
"I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man.",not spongebob,0
"If you work real hard, you may be an artist too someday!",not spongebob,0
"Mm, probably not. Needs more glitter.",not spongebob,0
"What is it, boy?",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob?  There, there, kid. What's the big deal?",not spongebob,0
"M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs!  We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir.",spongebob,1
"That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days!",not spongebob,0
"I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?",not spongebob,0
"You never forget, boss man.",spongebob,1
"What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?",not spongebob,0
2,not spongebob,0
Turmeric.,spongebob,1
"What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt.",not spongebob,0
"That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?",spongebob,1
It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?,not spongebob,0
"Scabs, sir?",spongebob,1
Was it pustule?,spongebob,1
"Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all.",not spongebob,0
No need to wonder about this. I got your formula.  Yee-haw!,not spongebob,0
"Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this.",not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out of the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer.",not spongebob,0
"I'm warning you, Mr. Krabs, Patrick'll eat anything you give him!",spongebob,1
"Breaking news!  Earlier today, Mr. Eugene Krabs, proprietor of the Krusty Krab restaurant, parted  with his beloved secret formula. We now go to Perch Perkins live on the scene.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Elaine. Just moments ago, Eugene Krabs sent his famously delicious secret Krabby Patty formula packing.",not spongebob,0
"Take care of yourself, little formula.",not spongebob,0
"Good-bye, secret recipe!",spongebob,1
We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs  what compelled him to take such drastic measures.,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.",not spongebob,0
"All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.",not spongebob,0
I believe we were at turmeric.,spongebob,1
"Boy, I thought I told you--",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no we forgot to look at the...",spongebob,1
"Formula, yeah.",not spongebob,0
And that formula is...,spongebob,1
"On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.",spongebob,1
Think you're up for the challenge?,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,spongebob,1
"Well, all right then,  the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"This, No. This is the key to me heart?  This is the safe-deposit box key.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you Mr.--",spongebob,1
"Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. (takes the key) It shan't leaveth my sight.,spongebob,1
"(Plankton hears the conversation with some technology of his) Good, let's get you over at the train station.",not spongebob,0
"This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't wait up for me, baby. (cuts to train station)",not spongebob,0
The Oceanic Express. (train whistles) Wish me luck.,spongebob,1
"Remember what I told you, boy? Keep your eye on the key.",not spongebob,0
"I can take your luggage for you, sir. (grabs Patrick) Please follow me.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, a real-life butler.",spongebob,1
I am not a butler.,not spongebob,0
All aboard!,not spongebob,0
"Bye, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! (train starts to leave as a bus drives up)",not spongebob,0
"(gets out of bus and runs up to the train) Wait! Wait for me! (sighs) Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta-- (train steam sends Plankton onto the road when a bus immediately smashes him) Oh, now they're on time... Uh-uh... (cut to inside of train)",not spongebob,0
Your sleeping quarters. (tosses Patrick in there) I trust everything is to your liking.,not spongebob,0
"Couldn't be better, butler.",spongebob,1
Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me.",spongebob,1
"An honest mistake, monsieur.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, my good man. (hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper) I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy.",spongebob,1
Peek-a-boo!,not spongebob,0
"Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters.",spongebob,1
"(Patrick's reflection in the mirror gets an angry face while the real Patrick asks SpongeBob a question) SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you? (looks back at the reflection) I think he might be spying on us. (Patrick's reflection goes away) Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry. (Rubs his tummy)",not spongebob,0
"Well, then follow me to the dining car.",spongebob,1
(climbs on top of a bus) Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way! (Plankton jumps) Uh-oh. (An 18-wheeler blocks his way and he splatters on the windshield. The driver is disgusted by the large green smear and turns on the wipers to scrape squashed Plankton off. He floats on down to the train) I knew I'd make it... (cut to the dining car),not spongebob,0
Ooh Fancy.,spongebob,1
"Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks. (baby heard crying)",not spongebob,0
"Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella.",spongebob,1
I just can't get him to stop crying. The poor dear.,not spongebob,0
"(sits down) Hi again, kind butler.",spongebob,1
(sighs) So sorry monsieur. The dining car is closed now.,not spongebob,0
(looks at watch) But we haven't even heard the specials yet.,spongebob,1
"No, the dining car is over for you. You must leave now. (pushes SpongeBob away. He trips over a purse. A lady picks him up)",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, ma'am.",spongebob,1
"That's quite alright, handsome. (cut to a train terrace)",not spongebob,0
"Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. (SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there)",spongebob,1
What is that?,not spongebob,0
"That my dear Patrick is—the key! (sees it missing) Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. (Plankton is walking by angrily)",spongebob,1
Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.,spongebob,1
"Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet.",not spongebob,0
"Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you.",spongebob,1
You calling me a liar?,not spongebob,0
"Yes. Search him, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"(puts on latex gloves) With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, drat.",not spongebob,0
"(picks up bowl) Just after I scrub this bowl. (scrubs bowl) Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you. (takes out some clamps. Plankton gasps) After my tasty snack. (uses the clamp to crush the nut. Plankton runs and screams) He's clean. (drops Plankton)",not spongebob,0
(grunts) I told you I wasn't lying.,not spongebob,0
"Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.",spongebob,1
"(puts his head out the window) Cops, I need you! (cut to the Krusty Krab)",not spongebob,0
(chanting) We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!,not spongebob,0
"Just give me a patty, man.",not spongebob,0
"For the last time, we're out of patties. (customers shout) No need to get excited now.",not spongebob,0
"We want our patties, man. (destroys the cash register)",not spongebob,0
"That's Krusty Krab property. (another customer rips off a pole) That's a load-bearing column. (customer swings the pole at Squidward. He ducks) Hurry, SpongeBob. (cut to train being stopped and all riders are outside the train)",not spongebob,0
"As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act. (SpongeBob points at the baby) Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff.",spongebob,1
Oh brother.,not spongebob,0
Mr. Police Commissioner?,spongebob,1
"Yes, Mr. SquarePants?",not spongebob,0
I sub-- (turns around and walks into the policeman) I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.,spongebob,1
(nervous chuckling) I haven't stolen a thing.,not spongebob,0
"Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.",spongebob,1
"Yes, Mr. SquarePants. (uses tongs to dig into the diaper. A metal sound clinks) Aha!",not spongebob,0
The key!,spongebob,1
"(uses tongs to take out a huge diamond) At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang.",not spongebob,0
Triplets?,spongebob,1
(deep voice) I told you taking the train was a mistake.,not spongebob,0
"(reveals himself being the legs of the nanny) Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card.",not spongebob,0
"Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?",not spongebob,0
"Tell it to your cellmate, junior. (handcuffs the baby)",not spongebob,0
If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.,spongebob,1
(sighs) I certainly did not.,not spongebob,0
We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.,spongebob,1
"For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.",not spongebob,0
"You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? (there is a full moon. A fish walks up and grows hair and changes into a werewolf. He howls and runs off)",not spongebob,0
"Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! (gets hit with a piece of popcorn from Patrick)",not spongebob,0
Sorry. (chomps on his popcorn),not spongebob,0
"Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.",not spongebob,0
I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.,not spongebob,0
"Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.",not spongebob,0
"Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.",spongebob,1
"Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.",not spongebob,0
"I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. (a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets)",spongebob,1
"Nothing suspicious here. (the butler's mask falls off) Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches. (Patrick screams)",not spongebob,0
"After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. (sobs) I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.",spongebob,1
"(picking his teeth with the key) Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.",not spongebob,0
The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?,spongebob,1
I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little accident earlier.,not spongebob,0
"Well, that is great news.",spongebob,1
"(yawns) Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, yeah, me, too. (runs up into the train)",spongebob,1
"(hiding behind the door hinges) Me, three. (laughs. Cut to the train moving. SpongeBob and Patrick are grunting as they try to get cozy in their very tight space of cabin)",not spongebob,0
"Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.",not spongebob,0
"I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.",spongebob,1
"Here, maybe I can help. (opens window. SpongeBob and Patrick stick out their tongues like dogs)",not spongebob,0
(sighs) Fresh water.,spongebob,1
What a cool view.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, have a better look. (hits them both with a 2x4, sending them out of the train and down a sandy hill. Train whistles) And thanks for the key!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob? (SpongeBob runs off) Guess not. (runs after him)",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?",spongebob,1
"Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?",not spongebob,0
"That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? (they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off)",spongebob,1
"Great, now what?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, hop up on my back.",spongebob,1
"Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.",not spongebob,0
Just do it.,spongebob,1
"Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr-- (screams. SpongeBob jumped off the cliff) Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please! (crying. SpongeBob flips onto Patrick's back and turns himself into a hang-glider) Hey, we're flying!",not spongebob,0
"There you go, buddy. (sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton) Oh, Plankton!",spongebob,1
You can't hide forever. (both yelp as a bunch of luggage falls on them),not spongebob,0
Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. (Plankton runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick chase after him through many train doors of the caboose and the passenger coaches and head through the coal tender and enter the engine's cabin),not spongebob,0
"Alright, Plankton, end of the line! (sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there) Plankton!",spongebob,1
"Over here, choo-choo heads. (laughs as he closes the door and then separates the train by uncoupling the tender, passenger coaches, and caboose from the engine)",not spongebob,0
That was odd.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. (sees the engine leaving the train behind) Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look.",spongebob,1
"Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?",not spongebob,0
"That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there.",spongebob,1
"Hmm. In that case... (both he and SpongeBob scream. Back to the other train parts with the tender, passenger coaches, and caboose)",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's going on?",not spongebob,0
I've got places to be.,not spongebob,0
Let's go already!,not spongebob,0
(opens one of the train doors and we see Far-Out-Ville and the bank across the way) It's too easy. (back to the head of the train),not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.",spongebob,1
"What do I do? What do I do? (reads the brake signal) B-R-A-K-E. BREAK. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. (shows the brake signal in his hand that he just broke)",not spongebob,0
(peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off) You broke the brake?,spongebob,1
It told me to.,not spongebob,0
"What do we do now? (starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls) Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!",spongebob,1
"I'm on it. (starts shoveling coal into the engine's firebox) Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. (The train engine overheats and runs out of control as if it might fall apart. At a train signal station, SpongeBob and Patrick signal for help over the radio)",not spongebob,0
We're on an out-of-control train! (man spits out his coffee),not spongebob,0
This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train.",spongebob,1
"Kid, let me talk to the engineer.",not spongebob,0
"Um, who?",spongebob,1
The guy driving the train.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Hi.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the back of the train is gone!",spongebob,1
"Oh, no. (looks at map) The train's headed straight for the rest home. (picture of Rest Home) And that means...",not spongebob,0
"Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?",spongebob,1
"(snaps on helmet) It means that train's coming right through that-- (the train engine crashes through the train depot) Beware the twisted trestles, kid! (lets go of the train engine)",not spongebob,0
What is that?,spongebob,1
(points) That's that. (the train engine does some loop-de-loops. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and laugh),not spongebob,0
(sigh) That was fun.,not spongebob,0
"Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us! (runs faster than the engine and holds up a 'STOP' sign. The train keeps going. Patrick tries again but uses a lemonade stand) Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon... (groans. The train engine passes by) Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! (runs past the train again)",not spongebob,0
"'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... (Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks)",spongebob,1
"Hey. Hey, wait for me... (climbs into the engine's cabin) Hey, SpongeBob! (the train engine crashes through a tunnel)",not spongebob,0
Whoa! Whoa! (the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home),spongebob,1
There's a train behind you.,not spongebob,0
How many times do you think I'm falling for that one?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. (the train engine stops before hitting the Rest Home. One of the citizens peeks at the other ones cards)",not spongebob,0
Hey! (SpongeBob and Patrick sigh),not spongebob,0
"Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. (the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville)",spongebob,1
"Hmm. (reads the throttle letters) T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Break! I can do that. (breaks the throttle handle. Walks up to SpongeBob) You didn't need this, did you? (The engine starts to increase its speed and go faster and faster. Cut to the bank)",not spongebob,0
"Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha. (uses ladder to get up to the safe-deposit box) Come to papa! (opens box and gets formula) At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.",not spongebob,0
"Well, well. (turns on a light)",not spongebob,0
What? B-b-but how?,not spongebob,0
"You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?",not spongebob,0
"I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.",not spongebob,0
"(laughs) Sure. I believe ya. (grabs Plankton) Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton. (as he puts Plankton in his safe-deposit box, Plankton jumps out and gets the formula) Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?",not spongebob,0
"Checkmate, Krabs! (laughs evilly. The runaway engine runs into the bank and squishes Plankton) Ow.",not spongebob,0
"Good job, boyo.",not spongebob,0
"I simply refused to fail, sir.",spongebob,1
"(clears throat) That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?",not spongebob,0
"Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'! Take care of it, will ya boy?",not spongebob,0
"(grabs Mr. Krabs) Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.",not spongebob,0
Noooooooooooooooo!,not spongebob,0
75 years later...,not spongebob,0
(now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom) And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?,spongebob,1
"(playing a game) Shh! I just beat my high score! Oh, yeah!",not spongebob,0
Kids today. (snores),spongebob,1
"Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?",spongebob,1
Talk to me.,not spongebob,0
"Package, sir.",not spongebob,0
A-ha!  I can't believe it's finally here!,not spongebob,0
Here ya go!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Mr... mmm... Tennisballs.",not spongebob,0
That's Tentacles!,not spongebob,0
Squidward's last name is Tentacles?,spongebob,1
"Poor guy.  Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.",not spongebob,0
Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.,spongebob,1
"Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, a snail made out of bread.",not spongebob,0
"No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.",not spongebob,0
Training?,spongebob,1
For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.,not spongebob,0
Sunday?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?",spongebob,1
Papers.,not spongebob,0
Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.',not spongebob,0
"That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.",not spongebob,0
You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.",spongebob,1
"Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.",spongebob,1
"Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, your snail is a rock.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.",not spongebob,0
"Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.",spongebob,1
"Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's a rock.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.",not spongebob,0
"What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.",spongebob,1
"You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
"Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!",spongebob,1
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, what are you doing?!  Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony.",not spongebob,0
"And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano!",not spongebob,0
"Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts...  ...for Larry.  He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.",not spongebob,0
Two hours later...,not spongebob,0
He's almost a quarter of the way there.,not spongebob,0
The torch is lit! Let the race begin.,not spongebob,0
"Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.",not spongebob,0
"Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.",spongebob,1
I'll alert the paramedics.,not spongebob,0
"Good one, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
You guys ready?,not spongebob,0
A burglar!,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick, that's the official.",spongebob,1
"We're ready to start here, folks.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.",not spongebob,0
On your mark. Get set.  Slither!,not spongebob,0
"And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!",not spongebob,0
What!,spongebob,1
"Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!",not spongebob,0
"What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!",spongebob,1
"It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.",not spongebob,0
"Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!",spongebob,1
"And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.",not spongebob,0
"Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!",spongebob,1
I do not like the look of this.,not spongebob,0
"Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!",spongebob,1
That coach is pushing that snail too hard!,not spongebob,0
"Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout!  Oops, make that two, folks.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, Gary?",spongebob,1
"Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.",not spongebob,0
"Umm, Gary, you can stop now!",spongebob,1
He's losing control!,not spongebob,0
"You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.",spongebob,1
He's spinning out of control!  He's heading straight for the wall!,not spongebob,0
"No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!",spongebob,1
"Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
Gary?  Oh!,spongebob,1
Aww!,not spongebob,0
"My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary.",not spongebob,0
"Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...",not spongebob,0
And the winner is Rocky!,not spongebob,0
"I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.",not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win?",not spongebob,0
"That's for yesterday, SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, these are delicious.",not spongebob,0
What was that?,not spongebob,0
Think it came from Krabs' office. Maybe he's in trouble.,not spongebob,0
"I'll save you, Mr. Krabs!  Ooh, Mr. Krabs, thank Neptune you're okay.  Eww, what was that noise?",spongebob,1
"Huh?  Uh, I didn't hear nothing. Everything's completely normal. Okay, closing time! Everyone out!  Eh..o-okay...  See you tomorrow.",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and I don't want to leave work early. Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I could still—  A nickel?  And it's the same temperature as Mr. Krabs.  Ooh, he's gonna want this back.",spongebob,1
Follow that boat!,spongebob,1
"Sorry about all those speed bumps, kid. And the cactus patch and the demolition derby.",not spongebob,0
"Roast moblem, Orfficer.",spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing here, boy-o?",not spongebob,0
"I brought your nickel, silly.  What is this place? And what are you doing here?",spongebob,1
"Nothing,  I've never been here before in my life.",not spongebob,0
"Eugene, got your usual here: one big steaming plate of chum! Enjoy.",not spongebob,0
"Usual? Chum? Enjoy? Oh, I don't understand, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I suppose there's no hiding it, boy-o. It all started back in me old Navy days.  I was a young seaman on a dangerous mission deep in enemy territory.",not spongebob,0
Meal time.,not spongebob,0
"Somehow, in the madness of battle, I became separated from me crew.  It took hours of fighting and sneaking and scraping to get back to me ship, but by the time I got there, our supplies have been decimated.  All we had left was chum...and I hadn't eaten since noon.  I was starting to feel peckish.  But, oh, that flavor. Sweet and gamy with a cream, chunky mouthfeel.  Oh, I've had a chum monkey on my back ever since.  Been eating the stuff in secret for years now.  Just got a taste for it. One of them survival things, I suppose.  Oh, uh, look, SpongeBob, I don't want this getting out, you understand?  Especially to Plankton. So what do you say, huh? Keep me shame a secret, huh? For old Mr. Krabsy?",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. Krabs. My lips are sealed.",spongebob,1
"Glad to hear it. Okay, see you tomorrow.  Sal, I'm feeling hungry tonight. How's about another plate of chum?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Eugene, that was my last plate of chum, ever! I'm closing the Slop Pail permanently.",not spongebob,0
What?!,not spongebob,0
"Yep, I'm moving to Shell City to make it big in the pictures. Just imagine this mug on a movie screen 30 feet wide!  See you in the movies!",not spongebob,0
But where will I get me chum from?,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Mr. Krabs, I've never tried to make chum before. I don't even know what the ingredients are.",spongebob,1
"Ugh, well, uh, it's, uh—it's made from...",not spongebob,0
"Eww.  Um, I don't think I can make that for you, Mr. Krabs, but I can make you some chum-free chum. You won't even be able to tell the difference.",spongebob,1
I sure hope you're right.,not spongebob,0
Later…,not spongebob,0
Behold: three takes on chum à la SpongeBob.  The secret ingredient in this one? Krabby Patties. Well? Huh?,spongebob,1
It's delicious!  Too delicious!  Next!,not spongebob,0
"To capture the natural bouquet of the chum, I made this batch entirely from old snail litter.",spongebob,1
A little dry.  Next!,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I think you'll like this one.  I know I do.  It's made from wishes and love.",spongebob,1
"It's too sweet. Oh, none of these are right, SpongeBob. I think this old chum chewer needs some time alone.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, the Chum Bucket's the only place in town still selling chum, but I can't go crawling to Plankton for help. No, I won't. I got too much pride for that.  Oh, come on, there's gotta be some chum in here somewhere!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, hello?  Who—who's out there?",not spongebob,0
"All right, miscreant, come over here where I can destroy you!",not spongebob,0
Krabs?,not spongebob,0
What are you doing here?,not spongebob,0
"Nothing, nothing! I, uh,  lost my shoe! See? Found it.  Okay, bye.",not spongebob,0
"Hold it. What's going on with you, Krabs? Your clothes are a mess and your stomach's making strange noises.",not spongebob,0
"What are you talking—I'm... Oh, fine!  I'm hooked on chum, okay?!",not spongebob,0
Say what?!,not spongebob,0
Look at me now! Digging through garbage for scraps!,not spongebob,0
You actually like chum?,not spongebob,0
How is that possible? Nobody likes chum! It tastes terrible!,not spongebob,0
"Shh! Mute your speaker, Karen. This pathetic display is giving me an idea.  All right, Krabs, old buddy, how would you like a lifetime supply of chum?",not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Sure, for the low, low price of the Krabby Patty secret formula!",not spongebob,0
"No, no, I can't! Not me formula.",not spongebob,0
"You sure, Krabs?  Just breathe in that noxious smell.  You know you want it.",not spongebob,0
Ah-ah-ah. Not until I have the formula.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, fine! I'll be right back.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"What are you doing here, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, when I can't sleep, I come here to be close to the formula. It comforts me.",spongebob,1
"Well, comfort time's over now!  I'm trading the formula to Plankton for a lifetime supply of chum.",not spongebob,0
"I can't let you do that, Mr. Krabs.  You'll thank me for this later.  Okay.  Gotta get a better grip.  Okay, okay.",spongebob,1
"Plankton, where are you? I got the formula! I'm here to collect me chum!",not spongebob,0
"I'm up here, Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo! Just look at all that chum! And it's all for me!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm so sorry, Krabs. You foiled too many of my plans over the years for me not to double-cross you now.  This time, I have the upper hand!  Get it? Upper hand?  I win and you get nothing!",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"You and SpongeBrain can see yourselves out, Krabs. Ta-ta!  Alley-oop!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, this is terrible! Oh, my formula's gone! I'm ruined! And hungry!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, Mr. Krabs! Plankton is tiny. It'll take him forever to swim through that chum.  You can get to the formula before him, but you're gonna have to eat like the wind.",spongebob,1
"You're right, boy-o! I can do this!",not spongebob,0
"Whoo!  Go, Mr. Krabs, go! Whoo!  No, don't fill up on bread! The chum! Eat the chum!",spongebob,1
Right!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you did it! You saved the secret formula.",spongebob,1
"Oh, and I think I killed me taste for chum too. See?  I'll never touch another bite of this stuff as long as I live.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, where'd Plankton go?",spongebob,1
"Hold still.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  Hmm, could take him a while to get out.",not spongebob,0
What should we do while we wait?,spongebob,1
"You'll never get away with this, Dr. Kelpington!",not spongebob,0
"Mm, could you pass the popcorn?",spongebob,1
Get me out of here!,not spongebob,0
Shh!,not spongebob,0
"♪Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!♪  For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you sir.",spongebob,1
What I do?,not spongebob,0
"Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, that warm welcome wasn't for you.",not spongebob,0
It wasn't?,spongebob,1

"Then, who was it for?",spongebob,1
It's for him!,not spongebob,0
"It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver!  And his first born son, Tony Fast Jr.!",spongebob,1
I can't believe it's him! Oh...,not spongebob,0
I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities.,spongebob,1

Hooray!,not spongebob,0
"He is good... Gasp! If he's really that good, maybe there's a chance, just a chance, some of that good could rub off my incorrigible student SpongeBob SquarePants!  Yes!",not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff?,spongebob,1
Yes SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
What does Incorrigible mean?,spongebob,1
So you just want me to ride around with this dude for awhile?,not spongebob,0

Just driving!  W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean?,spongebob,1
"Relax, man. You gotta relax.",not spongebob,0
Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet!,spongebob,1

Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard!  Raw! I cant' relax!,spongebob,1

Oh would I?,spongebob,1
And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama!,not spongebob,0
Wow! They're so shiny!,spongebob,1
Pick your favorite!,not spongebob,0
My favorite? Oh I couldn't!,spongebob,1
Why sure you can! What's the big-,not spongebob,0
This one!,spongebob,1
Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice!  Want to take her for a spin?,not spongebob,0
A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!,spongebob,1
You don't need a boating license for a raceboat SquarePants!,not spongebob,0
Wow Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!,spongebob,1
You're telling me!,not spongebob,0
"Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous...",spongebob,1

"Well class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us...",not spongebob,0
Gasp!,not spongebob,0
"He was transferred to another school. However, I would think that Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson...",not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?,spongebob,1
Close... the lesson is: Never let you drive!,not spongebob,0
I wish to register a complaint!,not spongebob,0
An urchin!!,not spongebob,0
Yuck!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, lady, take your infested-patty with you! Okay, no need to panic, Squidward. It's just a puny urchin. Everything's gonna be fine as long as you... Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!  Whew!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone.  He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is.  This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot.  Would you like to see a menu, Monsieur?  Ow!",spongebob,1
"Okay, little guy, see you later.  Good thing he is a little guy. Ouch.",spongebob,1
"What the shrimp?  Hey, what's going on here?  Whoa! That's too hot!  Whooaaa!!!  Wow.  Oops.",spongebob,1

SpongeBoob? Why are you so small? Is this a trick?,not spongebob,0
Calm down. He's clean. I frisked him.,not spongebob,0
"I didn't mean to get small like you, Plankton. It was a freak accident.",spongebob,1

"Sorry, Mr. K. I shrunk myself by mistake. But I won't let it affect my job. I will get back to flippin' right now.",spongebob,1
"Hold on there, Tiny. I can't have you workin' the grill no more. Too dangerous for a little guy like you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, please, Mr. Krabs! There must be some job I could do! I don't care what it is! Please, please, please!",spongebob,1
"Alright, I'll think of somethin'. But since you're so small now, I can only pay ya a penny. A year.",not spongebob,0

"Well, see you later, bud.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, that's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!",spongebob,1
Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!,not spongebob,0
How about now?,spongebob,1
Yep!,not spongebob,0
"...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter.  The rest of my things are right over there.",spongebob,1
Weee! Haha!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, and quarter, thanks!  Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys?  Guys?",spongebob,1
"Welcome to Inferno Island!   What in the seven seas just insulted my ear drum!? Could that had been an unrequested sound-off? Well, it must had been my imagination! And you can all thank your lucky stars that  I have a very active imagination! Because it so happens that it is my sworn duty to think of fun things to do with the trash that society has thrown away!",not spongebob,0
I had always preferred to recycle.,spongebob,1
"Holy fishpaste! We got ourselves a couple of rabble rousers. What's your name, son?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob SquarePants!,spongebob,1
And are you a rabble rouser?,not spongebob,0
Funny you should ask... once I had...,spongebob,1

"Actually, I am a little hungry.",not spongebob,0
"Hungry?! Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack. On the double!",not spongebob,0
Ohh. These guys are tough!,not spongebob,0
The food coma is setting in.,not spongebob,0
Yeah. I could use a nap.,spongebob,1
"Did you just say nap?! Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal.  A couple days in the hole never hurt anybody.",not spongebob,0
This camp is very upscale!,spongebob,1
I had no idea that they had a hot tub!,not spongebob,0
Three days later...,not spongebob,0
"Alright! Let them out!  Now pay attention, worms. Watch the way they crawl out on their bellies, begging for mercy, and see what's waiting for you, next time you fell up to same way these two did!",not spongebob,0
"It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!",spongebob,1
Not bad! Except for this aftertaste.,not spongebob,0
"Cut your traps, all of you, because of that little outburst, I am going to treat you all to an activity so heart-wrenchingly boring, it physically exhausting, that it is guaranteed to render your souls broken beyond repair!",not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
"This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights.,spongebob,1
"Good night, ladies!",not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.,spongebob,1
"If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other.  Good night!",not spongebob,0
That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters!,spongebob,1
"Rise and shine!  Now, which one of you vile, low-down, vile miserable wretched swine left this pathetic, worthless, horror and meaningless...",not spongebob,0
Uh... abomination?,spongebob,1
Who said that?,not spongebob,0
"Me, sir!",spongebob,1
What is the meaning of this thing?,not spongebob,0
"It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration!",spongebob,1
"Good. Well then, I'll watch your play, and I will enjoy every act of your pathetic, meaningless, ridiculous, production. You know why?",not spongebob,0
Uhh...because you cherish the fine art of thespianism?,not spongebob,0
"No! Because this will be the last act you will ever perform in your pathetic lives! So, get to it! And I'd better be truly entertained!",not spongebob,0
Cool!,spongebob,1
Kid's wasting his time.,not spongebob,0
All done!,spongebob,1

"How's it looking out there, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K.",spongebob,1
"I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too.  Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?",not spongebob,0
"Oooh, let me see there was... none.",spongebob,1
"What?! What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?",not spongebob,0
"Ha! Nobody reads the Examiner, bud. It's all full of boring charts and facts!  The Bottomfeeder's where it's at! It's got like interesting stories and stuff.",not spongebob,0
"Fishboy Strikes Again?  Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. But they're selling!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, they certainly are.  Please, allow me.",not spongebob,0
Thank you!,not spongebob,0
"No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25¢ per word?! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea!",not spongebob,0
"What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?",spongebob,1
"Yep, another wonderful humdrum day slinging burgers.",not spongebob,0
"Off of your duff, boy! You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new Krabby Kronicle!",not spongebob,0
Oh! My very own press badge!,spongebob,1
"That's right, boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy?",not spongebob,0
"On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look.  No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for!  Patrick Star, I'm Scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?",spongebob,1

"I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.",not spongebob,0
We haven't sold any papers today.,not spongebob,0
What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the Krabby Kronicle.,not spongebob,0
Looks boring. Can I just have a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
Too boring?  SpongeBob!  What's the meaning of this?!,not spongebob,0
"Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Local Resident Watches Pole? No one's gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy.",not spongebob,0
Imagination!,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Maybe instead of Man Watches Pole, you could say something like... oh... Man Marries Pole. Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see?  Now that's a juicy story!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?",spongebob,1
"Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell!",not spongebob,0
Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this!,spongebob,1
"Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase! I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote.",spongebob,1
"That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way?",not spongebob,0
I can't believe such a little news story could have ruined my business!,not spongebob,0

"Not now, SpongeBob. Let me take in the fact that my life is ruined!",not spongebob,0
Ruined? What are you talking about?,spongebob,1
These lies someone wrote about me.,not spongebob,0
"Thanks for your business, and here's your paper.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?",spongebob,1
"Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!",not spongebob,0
"That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good.",spongebob,1
"Well, they're certainly doing me some good.  Can you believe it? Look at all this loot!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?",spongebob,1
"Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting for everybody else.  Now get out there and fetch another story!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Karen! I think this is it! The Chum Stick that's finally gonna drive Krabs out of business!",not spongebob,0
I think not. I'm Health Inspector Yellowtail. I'm officially closing down your restaurant.,not spongebob,0
Why? I haven't done anything.,not spongebob,0
That's not what this says.,not spongebob,0

"You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I... I know.",spongebob,1
"What's wrong, boy? You sick or something?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that.",spongebob,1
"Don't be silly, boy! We're a success!",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people!",spongebob,1
"Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!",not spongebob,0

"Aye-aye, sir.",spongebob,1
"Sorry, fellers, this is a private treedome.",not spongebob,0

You've really outdone yourself this time!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore.",spongebob,1
"Come on, that's a bunch of hooey!",not spongebob,0
I've seen people's lives ruined with my own eyes!,spongebob,1
People want wild juicy stories! That's what sells! Now I want your little yellow noggin to come up with the wildest story ever! One that'll top all the others!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir?",spongebob,1
"Surprise me! Give me a shocker!  Good night, boy. I'll check on you tomorrow morning. And remember, the wildest story ever!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, the wildest story ever, huh?",spongebob,1
"How's it going, lad?",not spongebob,0

How could you do that to such an innocent child?! That is sick and inhumane!,not spongebob,0
Not to mention the fact that he's written lies about us!,not spongebob,0
I lost my restaurant because of you! And I thought I was evil...,not spongebob,0
All the kids in town want to beat me up for lunch money!,not spongebob,0
And I've had to go back to watching...  daytime television!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's it! We're taking our money back!",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay?",spongebob,1
"How can I be okay when me money's gone?! All gone!  It just goes to show, trying to make an easy buck doesn't pay.  Or does it?  Get me some scissors, boy-o! It's time to use my imagination!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys. Could you fix me and the wife up a couple of Krabby Patties?",not spongebob,0
"What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  Whooh!  There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there!  I knew this place looked familiar.  What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look.  Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.",not spongebob,0
And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?,not spongebob,0
"Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.",not spongebob,0
"Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet.",not spongebob,0
"Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.",not spongebob,0
Come on in then.,not spongebob,0
Seems so much bigger once your inside.,not spongebob,0
That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?,not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...",not spongebob,0
Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself.,not spongebob,0
"Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?",not spongebob,0
Tell me about your giant soybean.,not spongebob,0
This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people.,not spongebob,0
Or a supply of entire rest---.,not spongebob,0

"Well, I suppose so. But only a single drop.",not spongebob,0
Fair enough.  Is it suppose to smell like that?,not spongebob,0
"If you two will excuse me, I need to pay a quick visit to a little squirrel's room.  Would you mind holding these while I'm gone? I'll only be a minute.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, we don't mind.  Heh heh heh, there.",not spongebob,0
But Sandy said-,spongebob,1
"Sh sh sh sh sh sh sh.  Thanks for the tour, Sandy, see you later!",not spongebob,0
"Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Waste of a perfectly Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
"Great, let's get into the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
Patty... becoming... awkward...,spongebob,1
"Oh, here, here.  Put it in this grocery bag.",not spongebob,0
Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?,spongebob,1
The grocery store.,not spongebob,0
"So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?",spongebob,1
"Heh heh, who cares. It's an endless supply of free patties! And cook them fast, boy!  We got customers!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Are you going to cook that thing or just stand there staring at it?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward. Coming right up!  Order up, Squidward!",spongebob,1
"All right, keep them coming!",not spongebob,0
You betcha!,spongebob,1
Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one.  There we go.,spongebob,1
"Ok, that's great SpongeBob, but you don't have to knock me in the-  BAGEGAH!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, why did you make that weird noi-  Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen!  Nooooooo! Huh?  Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!",spongebob,1
"Do you always go barefoot at work, or have I just never noticed before?",not spongebob,0
"Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward, behind you!  Abandon ship!",spongebob,1
It's a Krabalanche!,not spongebob,0
Hold it! And just what is it you two think you're doing?,not spongebob,0
The restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. We're getting outta here!,not spongebob,0
"Whoa ho, this is a dream come true! You can't just leave!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, do you have a better idea?",not spongebob,0
Stay?... And work?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, you go right ahead. But I'd rather stay alive than stay at work. That means you-",not spongebob,0
Cashy!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, look out!",spongebob,1
Aaah!,not spongebob,0
"I think it's our break time, don't you?",not spongebob,0
"What's this?  Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?!  Ah, I'd better get a closer look.    Out of my way, you fools!",not spongebob,0
"Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!",spongebob,1
"I can't hear you! I need to see this!  Holy mother of all creatures great and small!  It's the largest Krabby Patty the world has ever seen! It's... it's... gorgeous...  Oh, great patty! Take me! Take me home, daddy!",not spongebob,0
"Keep running, it's getting closer!",not spongebob,0
"No, it isn't! Look! Where I'm pointing! It stopped!",not spongebob,0
Hey! He's right!,not spongebob,0
Snookums! Look out!  You've got to promise mommy you'll be more careful! Neptune knows what he'd do if you were swallowed by the putrid ooze that's running rapid in our streets.,not spongebob,0
Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant Krabby Patty!,spongebob,1
Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!,spongebob,1
"Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
That wasn't a dream!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob! What do we do?,not spongebob,0
"We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!",spongebob,1
"I don't think she's home, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy, where are you?",spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Sandy?,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob! Up here!  And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what happened to your treedome?",spongebob,1
"Well, that giant soybean got too big, so I chopped it up into a giant salad. Anyone got any giant croutons?",not spongebob,0
...I think I'm gonna be sick.,not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, Patrick? Airsickness?",spongebob,1
No...the thought of a salad that size is more than I can handle.,not spongebob,0
"And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty.",not spongebob,0
Really? How?,spongebob,1
"The puzzle cube told me. The key to defeating the patty is you, SpongeBob! All I have to do is get you closer to the patty so that you can make direct contact.",not spongebob,0
Direct contact!? Are you sure?,spongebob,1
The puzzle cube never lies.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, we have visual. Putting you into position, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, bye.",spongebob,1
"Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait, what was I supposed to do again?",spongebob,1
Just make direct contact!,not spongebob,0
"Direct contact, you mean like this?",spongebob,1
It's working! Keep going! You can do it!,not spongebob,0
Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain.,spongebob,1
"Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body, come to think of it!",spongebob,1
Ok...what do I do now?,spongebob,1
"Step right up folks! For a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Two! Medium-rare!,not spongebob,0
Copy that. Over.,spongebob,1
"That's it! Don't crowd! While supplies last, don't be shy! Come on!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.  There we go.",not spongebob,0
"Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!  Fluoride to Desktop, I'm in a position to raise no suspicion, over.",not spongebob,0
"Cut the poetry, Wordsworth. Did you get Krabs' hair sample yet?",not spongebob,0
"Keep your pants on, woman! I'm gonna steal his hairs right out of his razor.",not spongebob,0
I'll just grab the razor here...,not spongebob,0
Wait! No!  Auugh!,not spongebob,0
Ehhh!,not spongebob,0
Now for the rest of it.,not spongebob,0
"Well, if it isn't my thieving husband. So did you bring me the—  Hair?  I only needed one.",not spongebob,0
"Hee-hee-hee! You married a genius, Karen. Using the DNA of Krabs' hair and my own DNA from my antennae—  Ouch!  I will create a combo-clone of me and Krabs to finally steal the secret formula!",not spongebob,0
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Behold PlanKrab!,not spongebob,0
Heh-heh-heh.,not spongebob,0
Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr!,not spongebob,0
How is this a good thing?,not spongebob,0
"Wake up, Karen! The Plankton side will know everything the Krabs side knows! It'll be easier than taking candy from a baby.",not spongebob,0
"Mm, and we know how successful that was.",not spongebob,0
"This is different! Isn't it, PlanKrab, my pretty? Now, here's my plan.",not spongebob,0
"Don't waste your breath, Plankteron. I already mapped out the perfect plot to swipe that formuler-ererer!",not spongebob,0
"Great! See you soon, P.K.!  I love that guy. Well, half of him anyway.  Still got a hair in there.",not spongebob,0
Where is PlanKrab with the secret formula? It's been over three minutes already!,not spongebob,0
"All right, Two-Face, what's the big idea? What have you been doing all this time?!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, nothing much-erer. Just stealin' the formuler-erer…",not spongebob,0
Uh-whaaa?,not spongebob,0
Taking over this restaurant-erer…,not spongebob,0
Hooray for PlanKrab! He's the best boss ever!,not spongebob,0
And kicking Krabs out on his booty-erererer!,not spongebob,0
B-b-but how?!,not spongebob,0
"All it took, me hearty, was a hearty handshake. The world's persuasive handshake, that is!  It's me latest creation. Put her there-erer, matey.",not spongebob,0
"An evil handshake. That's hands down the dumbest thing I ever—  Huh?  Oh. Ooh. Heh-heh, yeah. Oh, ooh, ahh, ahh. Yeah, yeah. Ahh! Yeah. Ohh-ho-ho!  Oh, your handshake is exquisite! I'd believe anything you say.",not spongebob,0
"Then believe this, swabby.  I'll also be commandeer-ering the Chum Bucket from now on.",not spongebob,0
"Ahh—ahh. Sounds great to me, P.K.",not spongebob,0
And I'm afraid your services are no longer required-ererered!,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, I still can't get over this handshake.  I'm over it now.",not spongebob,0
Plankton!  Some creepy one-eyed crab took me restaurant!,not spongebob,0
Wait a minute. I think he took mine too!,not spongebob,0
"I-I-I don't know what happened. But that was some handshake of his, huh? I mean...hoo—hoo!",not spongebob,0
"Snap out of the handshake! It's a trick, Krabs!  A dirty, beautiful trick!",not spongebob,0
"Say, this Krabby Patty tastes even better than usual. What's in it, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's the same old patty, except now each one has a pinch of chum added.",spongebob,1
A pinch of ch-ch-ch-chum?,not spongebob,0
"Good work, me boy-o.",not spongebob,0
Wow!,spongebob,1
Me boy-o?,not spongebob,0
"There's only one way to get our restaurants back, Eugene.",not spongebob,0
You don't mean...,not spongebob,0
We gotta work together...!,not spongebob,0
Hair.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what the...",not spongebob,0
"He may have taken our restaurants, but we'll take his customers!",not spongebob,0
This way! Drive-thru! Literally.,not spongebob,0
"All right, all right! I can't go any lower, Eugene! Please make it stop!",not spongebob,0
"It looks like there's only one way out of this one, Sheldon.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! You don't mean...",not spongebob,0
Yeah. I'm afraid so.,not spongebob,0
"That'll be all for now, Spongematey.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, could I just have one more handshake, Captain?",spongebob,1
Sure as yer born.,not spongebob,0
Ooh….,spongebob,1
"So you two scallywags want to work for me, eh?",not spongebob,0
I wanna be the manager!,not spongebob,0
"Well, you're both in luck. It just so happens I'm looking for two new manager-erers…",not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
To manage me toilets!,not spongebob,0
"Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten us into.",not spongebob,0
Hair.,not spongebob,0
The humiliation in here stinks!,not spongebob,0
"This is all your fault, Plankton. I'm gonna keel haul yer face at lunchtime!",not spongebob,0
Why wait? Let's take a coffee break!  Pow!,not spongebob,0
Swirly!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I'm trying to read!  Ahh! Hey!",not spongebob,0
Two guys...fighting...toilet paper everywhere!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah?  Who's defiling me rester-ereroom?!",not spongebob,0
He did it!,not spongebob,0
He did it!,not spongebob,0
"No, he did it! No, he did it! No, he did it!",not spongebob,0
"Get off of him, Plankton!",not spongebob,0
It was obviously Krabs' fault!,not spongebob,0
Why are you siding with Plankton?!,not spongebob,0
Why are you siding with Krabs?!,not spongebob,0
They're arguing!,not spongebob,0
And splitting up!,not spongebob,0
Stop hitting myself!,not spongebob,0
Ow!  Stop hitting myself! I'm sick of you!,not spongebob,0
What in Neptune's name is wrong with meself?!,not spongebob,0
"Jeez, is that what we sound like?",not spongebob,0
"I hope not, 'cause that's pathetic.",not spongebob,0
"I can't stop hitting myself, because I'm torn!",not spongebob,0
"All right, you clones, I want a clean fight. No rough stuff. Go back to your corners when the bell rings and come out fighting.",not spongebob,0
"But first, you gotta shake hands.",not spongebob,0
"Well, fine.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, this is a great handshake.",not spongebob,0
Splitting? So soon?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you.",not spongebob,0
Hair.,not spongebob,0
"Here, me bucko. Let me get that for ya.",not spongebob,0
Freedom!,not spongebob,0
"Well, good night, folks. Come again.  Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.",spongebob,1
"Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?!",not spongebob,0
"All ready, Mr. Krabs.  Just gotta clock out and...",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this?",not spongebob,0
"Spot, spot, spot!",spongebob,1
"That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...",not spongebob,0
"...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.",not spongebob,0
"Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone?",spongebob,1
"Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.",not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  You're a tough little guy, aren't ya?  This means war.",spongebob,1
"Wait here, please.  Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire!",spongebob,1
That is the last straw! I want you to remember...  you made me do this.,spongebob,1
I got to finish this.,spongebob,1
"I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the SpotMaster 6000.  Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleansing materials.  I call it...  ...Steel Wool! And it comes with...  ...a laser! Any last words?  Mmm... I thought not.  Power up!",spongebob,1
Water cannon... on!  No effect. Steel wool laser... on!,spongebob,1
"Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams!  More power!",spongebob,1
"Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.",not spongebob,0
More power!,spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, that can't be good.",not spongebob,0
More power!,spongebob,1
Let's see what he's done this time.,not spongebob,0
Maximum power! Ahhhhh!,spongebob,1
"Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?",not spongebob,0
"The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I'll clean your platter!  Come here, you!",not spongebob,0
Yes! My plan is working!  Now everyone in town will know what a jerk Krabs is. Yeah!  Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, you!  You're under arrest.",not spongebob,0
Arrest? For what? I didn't even steal anything this time.,not spongebob,0
"Vandalism's a crime too. You've been caught red-handed, Plankton.",not spongebob,0
"Eh, should've used the green paint.",not spongebob,0
"I usually laugh all the way to the bank.  But for you, Plankton, I'll laugh all the way to the clink!",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, the prison is full!  Looks like we'll just have to set you free.",not spongebob,0
"What, free?! But he's a criminal!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you know what they say. Don't stop the crime if you can't enforce the time.",not spongebob,0
"Eat it, Krabs! I'm off to re-offend.",not spongebob,0
It's a shame that there's no other place in Bikini Bottom to hold our extra criminals. 'Cause we'd give that place a lot of money.,not spongebob,0
"You got yourself a deal!  We can lock him up at my place,  the Krusty Krab.",not spongebob,0
"Well then,  this is for the prisoner.  And here's your cash.",not spongebob,0
"Whoa.  Thank you, Madame Officer.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, stupid barnacles, tartar sauce, fish paste—",not spongebob,0
"Enjoy your ride, Plankton?",not spongebob,0
Ow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Mr. Squidward. Didn't see you there.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison.",spongebob,1
He is. The Krusty Krab is a prison now.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hooray! Prison!",spongebob,1
"Oh, big deal. I've been a prisoner here for years.",not spongebob,0
"Hardy-har, Mr. Squidward.  You boys get back to work!  I'll be guarding Plankton in me office.  Into your cell, you miscreant!",not spongebob,0
"All right, I'm out of here.  Uh, pardon me, warden, sir, but is that a pretty penny on the floor?",not spongebob,0
Where? It's mine! It's mine! I saw it first!,not spongebob,0
The perfect escape.  YEEOOWW!!!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no you don't.  Trying to escape is bad enough, but lying about a penny? You're going in...  ...the hole.  Need one of your holes, boy-o.",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Warden Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hey, let's not do anything we can't—",not spongebob,0
And don't let him go nowhere!,not spongebob,0
"Aye-aye, sir!",spongebob,1
"All right, who turned off the lights?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me.",spongebob,1
That oughta learn him.,not spongebob,0
"Morning, Warden.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, me favorite paying police lady. Here to give me more money?",not spongebob,0
"Yup, more money for more prisoners.",not spongebob,0
More prisoners?,not spongebob,0
"Aye, the Krusty Krab. I used to eat here.",not spongebob,0
What a coincidence. I used to rob here.,not spongebob,0
"So, what do you say, Mr. Krabs?",not spongebob,0
I say... lock 'em up!  SpongeBob! Try to prison-up the place for our new guests. I gotta go incarcerate all this cash.,not spongebob,0
"I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!",spongebob,1
"Nice work, boy-o. Very prison-y.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, uh, what's with all the caged men in here?  They're making me a little nervous...!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, um, well we're a prison-themed restaurant now.  Do your time with our new Prison Patty.  It's served in a solitary confinement box, has its own prisoner number, and even comes with toy shackles!",not spongebob,0
Wow!,not spongebob,0
Looks delicious.,not spongebob,0
"At the Krusty Krab, you can lock up your hunger and throw away your keys!  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ooh, crisis averted. Okay, time to let Plankton out of the hole. Open her up, boy-o.  Hmm.  Pull yourself together, prisoner!  I got a new cell for you.",not spongebob,0
"The formula?! It's so close... I can almost touch it! No, no, no, no!",not spongebob,0
Good times. Good times.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have?  Toothy.  Four Eyes.  Lefty.  Fats.  Fingers.  Einstein.  Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky.",spongebob,1
"Thanks, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"No problem, guys.",spongebob,1
"Oh, morning, officer.",not spongebob,0
I'm here to oversee Plankton's release.  His sentence is up.,not spongebob,0
What?! But I have so many more punishments for him!,not spongebob,0
"Enjoy your Plankton-free prison, Eugene.  I hope it's worth what you're paying for it.",not spongebob,0
Hmm? Paying for it? Wonder what he means by that. Huh?,not spongebob,0
"More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing?!  Do you have any idea how much it costs to make a prison humane?! These down comforters, they're two-y.  This ain't no luxury hotel!  These televisions ain't free!  And neither are these massage chairs!  And this, your most expensive mistake of all!  From now on, no more patties for prisoners!",not spongebob,0
Cruel and unusual punishment!,not spongebob,0
And no more tomatoes either!,not spongebob,0
"Come on, let's find another prison to eat at.",not spongebob,0
What a rip-off! / Come on.,not spongebob,0
"No, no! Come back! Come back! I can't afford to lose me paying customers. Oh, I'm ruined!  All right, that's it!  No more prison! Everyone out!  Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here!  Oh, finally. The Krusty Krab is back to being a regular old money-making restaurant.  Problem solved.  I said problem solved!",not spongebob,0
Later at night...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?",spongebob,1
We want to go back to the Krusty Krab. We were having fun in there with you. See?,not spongebob,0
"Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in.",spongebob,1
The next day...,not spongebob,0
"Morning, Warden Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Morning, prisoners!  SpongeBob! What is going on here? I set all these criminals free last night! What are they doing back in their cells?!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—",spongebob,1
"You know it's a crime to release prisoners early, don't ya?  You're going to prison,  criminal.",not spongebob,0
"What? Oh, well, that's not so bad. Pencil me in for a 3:30 massage, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're not staying here. The Krusty Krab is full. We got a new prison just for you.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no... Let me guess...",not spongebob,0
"Mealtime, prisoner!  Right in the mouth.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, would you like any fries with that?",not spongebob,0
"Uh,  Hey, if I get some kelp fries, would you guys share them with me?",not spongebob,0
Do we know you?,not spongebob,0
"Two orders of kelp fries, please.",not spongebob,0
And two orders of—,not spongebob,0
I only said one order.,not spongebob,0
But you said two.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, I'll have two.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, order up.  Welcome to The Krusty—  SpongeBob, what in Neptune's...  SpongeBob?  Well, his spatula's still warm.  Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.",not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Squidward.  Good Neptune, SpongeBob. What has gotten into to you, son?",not spongebob,0
I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.,not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward. This is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days.  What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money!  It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date.  Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab?!",not spongebob,0
"That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say.  I rest my case.  Hey, in or out, mister? You're letting out the A.C.  Weirdo.",not spongebob,0
"Why, hello! You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't ya? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine...",not spongebob,0
"Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop! Don't you know our lives depend on his review?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00.",not spongebob,0
"M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please! Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely—  Complimentary.  Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all.  He's nobody.  We're doomed!",not spongebob,0
And there were no survivors.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Barbara.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Bob.",not spongebob,0
She is so tacky.,not spongebob,0
And now it's time for Bottom Feeding with Gene Scallop.,not spongebob,0
"Turn it up, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited--",not spongebob,0
"You're welcome, Gene.",not spongebob,0
"This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to run, since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.",not spongebob,0
"That bad, huh, Gene?",not spongebob,0
"Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not kidding when I say this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat.",not spongebob,0
"And how was the service, Gene?",not spongebob,0
"You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just coffin.  The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me in it.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, no, wait! Wait!",not spongebob,0
"However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking.  If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd over-sponge it. You can never have too much sponge.",not spongebob,0
"Well, back to work.",spongebob,1
"That's me boy, SpongeBob! That's me boy.",not spongebob,0
"La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow.",spongebob,1
"Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect!",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?",spongebob,1
"Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—",spongebob,1
"Umm— yeah, a little bit like that.",not spongebob,0
"Morning, Squidward!  Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes?",spongebob,1
"Look, it's him!  Mr. SquarePants, can I have your autograph?",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"But, why?",not spongebob,0
"Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. See?",not spongebob,0
Ow!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, what's going on over here?",not spongebob,0
"He hit me, just as I wanted his autograph!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for five bucks.",not spongebob,0
What a rip!,not spongebob,0
"Look at these, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Looks like some horrific shroud.,not spongebob,0
They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.,not spongebob,0
You really need to see a doctor.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes.",not spongebob,0
What's in them?,not spongebob,0
Condiments. We got Tangy Spongy Sauce and Mild Bobby Sauce for the not-so-daring.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, clever.",not spongebob,0
"Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!",spongebob,1
"I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward.  You're on grill duty now.",not spongebob,0
But that's SpongeBob's job!,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him.  Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train! Tickets are only $1.98. Seat belts not included.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm—  Mommy, is that you?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I really think I should be getting back to the grill now.",spongebob,1
"Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers!  Who's ready for another lap?  Keep on truckin', SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
"Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, tell them I'll be right out.",not spongebob,0
Got it.  Ow!,not spongebob,0
"And let's watch the language, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
"Just sign here, here and here.",not spongebob,0
My pleasure.,not spongebob,0
What the heck is all this stuff?,not spongebob,0
"I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws—  coasters—  bibs—  and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes!  Aww.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?",not spongebob,0
"Get back to work, SpongeBob! I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me.  Whoops!  There you go, Squidward.",not spongebob,0
Now what?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties!",not spongebob,0
Spongy Patties?,not spongebob,0
Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones.,not spongebob,0
Where'd you get them?,not spongebob,0
"They were just the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.",not spongebob,0
You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98!",not spongebob,0
All aboard...,spongebob,1
"Hey, we didn't pay $3.00 to watch you take a nap!",not spongebob,0
"That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen!  Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion?  Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!",spongebob,1
"Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.",not spongebob,0
"Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies!  Open up, open up, open up!",spongebob,1
Who?,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
SpongeBob—  Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money!,not spongebob,0
"Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look!",spongebob,1
I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.,not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patty?  Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty—",not spongebob,0
It's a... It's a Spongy Patty!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You've poisoned all these people!",spongebob,1
"No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I...  What the...?",not spongebob,0
"Tell it to the judge, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
Calling the courtroom to attention in the case People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs. The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.,not spongebob,0
Has the jury reached a verdict?,not spongebob,0
"We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene H. Krabs, guilty of all charges.",not spongebob,0
Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?,not spongebob,0
"No, your honor.",not spongebob,0
Very well.,not spongebob,0
"Eh, hang on a second there, judge! That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.",not spongebob,0
"Permission to approach the bench, your honor!",not spongebob,0
"Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position.  Take him around as many times as you like.",not spongebob,0
I just might have to take you up on that.,not spongebob,0
I love a happy ending.,not spongebob,0
I wanted to be Mermaid Man this year.,not spongebob,0
Trick or treat.,not spongebob,0
I love Halloween.  Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Ah!  Hm... Mm-hm. It's scary, but...  Oh. Hello.  Hm...",spongebob,1
Hello!,not spongebob,0
"Hello, Sir Patrick. How do you like my decorations?",spongebob,1
"Those are too cute for Halloween, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year.",spongebob,1
"I thought it was about getting your pants scared off. Hey, where's your costume?",not spongebob,0
Close your eyes.  Okay. Open 'em.  ♪I'm a lovely flower♪ Ooh...,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's not scary either, SpongeBob. Wait, I'll show you what scary is.",not spongebob,0
Let's go to this house.,not spongebob,0
Oh... There is no candy here...,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
Only onions!  Now move along. Ooh...,not spongebob,0
"No candy. That is so scary. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  SpongeBob, why are you hiding in there? You'll miss all the scary stuff.",not spongebob,0
"I don't want to see the scary stuff, Patrick. Okay? I admit it. I love trick-or-treating, but I am too afraid to go out on Halloween!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, don't you know the old saying? The only thing you have to fear is...  Yourself!  Aah! Stop staring at me like that! No!  See? It's all in your head, SpongeBob. You just have to remember one simple trick, and that is: scary equals funny.",not spongebob,0
Scary equals funny. Hm. Never looked at it that way before.  Doink. All right. I'll go out.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"Here I am.  Just looking for cavities. Nope. None here. Oh, let's go out and get scared.",spongebob,1
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Sure you can handle this, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll be fine, Patrick. Really. But can we hold hands, just in case you get scared?",spongebob,1
Deal.,not spongebob,0
Whoa...,not spongebob,0
"Welcome to my lab, SpongeBob and Patrick. I am the evil Dr. Franken-Cheeks.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, Sandy. I didn't recognize you.",spongebob,1
"Uh, yeah, great costume.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thanks, guys. Now, feast your fingers on my jars of horror!",not spongebob,0
Whoa...,not spongebob,0
Stick your hand in the jar and guess what's inside...If you dare!,not spongebob,0
"Oy.  Ew. Oh. Ew, it feels like worm guts.",spongebob,1
Wrong!  It's just noodles.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm savvy to this game, Sandy.  So these brains are probably a slimy head of lettuce, or maybe some boiled broccoli.",spongebob,1
Wrong! It's—  Patrick? Get out of there.,not spongebob,0
"Don't stop, SpongeBob. That's the spot. Ah...",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you really got me.",spongebob,1
Ew!  How impolite of me! I forgot to introduce you to my little friend.,not spongebob,0
Oh...,not spongebob,0
That's the most realistic fake monster I ever saw.,spongebob,1
"Who are you calling fake?!  Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the fear of a scared SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny.",spongebob,1
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
Come in and see the horrors of the Chum Bucket.,not spongebob,0
"Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm Plankton! Ha, ha, ha, I'm evil!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Scary.,spongebob,1
What are you two laughing about? There's nothing funny about the food abuse that goes on at the Chum Bucket! You should be terrified!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs, but our new philosophy is scary equals funny.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, and funny divided by two idiots equals stupid.",not spongebob,0
"I don't get it. When I was a kid, Halloween meant 24 continuous hours of screaming your head off! These kids today...",not spongebob,0
"Come to the Chum Bucket, and witness the horrors of the Krusty Krab! You may never eat a Krabby Patty again!",not spongebob,0
"Ready for more funny, Sir Clanks-a-lot?",spongebob,1
I'm driving!  Charge!,not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Welcome to the Chum Bucket. I'm Karen the cat.,not spongebob,0
Do the scary part.,not spongebob,0
"Ooh, scary!",spongebob,1
Scary? That's nothing.  Behold!  The horrors of the Krusty Krab.  Look down.,not spongebob,0
Hm?,not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"No dawdling! Step right up!  The evil Mr. Krabs and his band of jolly, mindless fools stalk Bikini Bottom by night for delicious victims then drag their lifeless bodies back to the kitchen, and grind them into grinders!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Plankton, you are a panic.",spongebob,1
And guess what? You're eating it! Krabby Patties are people! They're people patties! You're eating people patties!,not spongebob,0
Yeah!  Come on!,not spongebob,0
Boo!,not spongebob,0
"Ah! Music to me ears. Halloween night, and everyone is getting their bloomers scared off! This holiday is the worst!  Wait a millennium.  That kid isn't screaming with fear.",not spongebob,0
Huh. What do you want?,not spongebob,0
Scare and release!  I love this job.,not spongebob,0
Ugh.  Who dares to laugh at All Hallows' Eve?!  I'm going to find out.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, who would've thought I'd be laughing myself silly tonight?",spongebob,1
You!  You dare to laugh on Halloween?!,not spongebob,0
Um...I guess so?,spongebob,1
What's the matter with you? Aren't you afraid of scary things?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I was, until I found out that scary equals funny.",spongebob,1
Scary equals funny?,not spongebob,0
I love this guy!,spongebob,1
"I don't get it. How could anyone confuse scary with funny?  Hm. No wonder you're not scared. These decorations are laughable!  I'm sorry, kid. I had no idea how fright-deprived you were. Not to worry. You're in bad hands!  I'll show you something to scream about aboard me ship!  You interested?",not spongebob,0
Sure. Can I bring a guest?,spongebob,1
Does a bear fish sleep in the kelp forest?,not spongebob,0
"Where are we going, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny!",spongebob,1
"This music doesn't sound funny, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Stop that clanking!,not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
Oh! Hey!,spongebob,1
"All bilge rats on deck! We have company, and we want to show them a good time!",not spongebob,0
That tickled!,spongebob,1
"Hang on to your bloomers, SpongeBob! It's going to be a bumpy fright!",not spongebob,0
"♪When you hear the lonesome ring of chimes that bring the spirits singing, soon your spine is tingling and there's just one thing to say, ahh!  Eyeballs in the dark dilating, now your heart is palpitating, and there's only just one thought that you can convey.  Terror all around you! You can't get away! We take pride in making sure you have a frightful stay.  Join the wretched chorus in the nightmare play, and remember it's all you can scream at the ghost café.♪",not spongebob,0
Oh...,spongebob,1
"♪Terror all around you and we've just begun.  You'll be trembling helpless lump of fear when we are done. Grim unearthly creatures flaunting nauseating features make for ghastly midnight screechers, you'll be speechless but for Ahh!  Surrender to the horrifying phantom freaks who death-defying stunts of fearful madness startle with a shocking interjection from which there is no protection!  Boo!♪",not spongebob,0
Grr...How can he still be laughing? I've never been so humiliated. I got to do something here.,not spongebob,0
"Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place!",spongebob,1
Friends! He's got friends. That's it! I know how to scare this guy.,not spongebob,0
Happy Halloween!  W—what? Where?,not spongebob,0
Trick or treat!,not spongebob,0
Huh? Oh!,not spongebob,0
Hey!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob! Patrick! Help me!,not spongebob,0
That almost looks like Sandy.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Patrick!,not spongebob,0
Help us!,not spongebob,0
"That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton.  Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical.  Why aren't you laughing?  Patrick? What's wrong with you?",spongebob,1
"Help me, SpongeBob! My body's butt itches!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick? Is this really happening? Hey, this isn't funny.",spongebob,1
"I was wrong, SpongeBob. Sometimes, scary equals scary!",not spongebob,0
Hm?  Yup. I got the same answer. Scary equals Ahh!,spongebob,1
Success! I knew that would get him!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,spongebob,1
That's the scariest thing I ever saw in my life!,not spongebob,0
Me too. But we gotta go back.,not spongebob,0
Go back? Are you nuts?,not spongebob,0
Show a little backbone! We gotta save our friends!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, you're right. But I'm still scared. Will you hold my hand?",not spongebob,0
Deal.,not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
"You know, I gotta say, pretty impressed with your whole evil presentation here. Nice work. I could use a guy like you to walk through walls. I take over the world, and we split it, 70-30. How's that grabbin' you?  Yes, master...",not spongebob,0
"I guess with friends like SpongeBob, you don't need anemones, huh, gang?",not spongebob,0
You can't talk about SpongeBob like that!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah? If SpongeBob's so great, where is he? Huh?",not spongebob,0
"And, now, I'm going to roast your souls over a devil pit!  Just like Grandma used to!",not spongebob,0
The blue fire is so hot!,not spongebob,0
My puppet?,not spongebob,0
"You let my friends go, buddy boy!",spongebob,1
"You were trying to scare me? Now that is funny.  You couldn't frighten me in a million eternities, kid.",not spongebob,0
"I think he could, master. You've never seen what's inside his brain!",not spongebob,0
His brain? Ha! What's scary about that?,not spongebob,0
"I was in there once. It's too terrifying, even for ghosts!",not spongebob,0
I'll decide if it's scary or not!,not spongebob,0
Wa...Whoa!,not spongebob,0
Ah! Ah! Ah! Don't—don't!,not spongebob,0
That didn't scare me one bit.  I—I bet you don't have a scary thought in your entire brain!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures.",spongebob,1
I wuv you this much!,not spongebob,0
I'm actually scared!  So much horror!,not spongebob,0
Ahh!,not spongebob,0
Ooh.,not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Oh! I got my butt back!,not spongebob,0
"I don't know what's inside that brain of yours, but I sure hope I never see it. Thanks, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
But did we learn anything?,not spongebob,0
Sure. We learned not to be afraid to never be scared of being afraid again.,spongebob,1
My employee saved us! Party at the Krusty Krab! For a reasonable fee.,not spongebob,0
Ugh. What happened? Whew. Must have been a nightmare.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, guys! Free candy!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, I'm really late again. Maybe they'll finally fire me.  Locked?",not spongebob,0
This isn't happening. This isn't happening!,spongebob,1
Spongebob?,not spongebob,0
"The horror, it's unspeakable!  Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!",spongebob,1
You mean I got out of bed for nothing?,not spongebob,0
"The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone.",spongebob,1
"Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you're here!  Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space?!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Harsh.,not spongebob,0
"Arrgh, me back!",not spongebob,0
"Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze!",not spongebob,0
"Oh good, I thought you were hurt.",spongebob,1
"I am hurt, ya idiot!  I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind.  Oh, me back.",not spongebob,0
"Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?",spongebob,1
Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more.,not spongebob,0
"I'm serious, Squidward.",spongebob,1
So am I.,not spongebob,0
We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again.,spongebob,1
"What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you.",not spongebob,0
"That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea.  Thanks for coming with me, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store.",not spongebob,0
I've never seen so many mattresses.,spongebob,1
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
How many do you think there are?,spongebob,1
10.,not spongebob,0
Cool.,spongebob,1
There's plenty more than that. Try them out. Find one you like.,not spongebob,0
What are you morons doing?,not spongebob,0
Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress.,spongebob,1
"Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card.  Trying to outsmart me, will ya?  There, I signed it for all of us.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, you didn't even help pay.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy.",spongebob,1
"Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like...",not spongebob,0
Surprise!,not spongebob,0
"Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?",not spongebob,0
"We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress.",spongebob,1
So I suggested we get you a new one.,not spongebob,0
I thought it was your idea.,not spongebob,0
"So, where's me old mattress then?",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.",not spongebob,0
All my money was in that mattress!,not spongebob,0
What?! Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!,not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
And we got you a card.,not spongebob,0
Is there money in it?,not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?",spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.,not spongebob,0
It was SpongeBob's fault! Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea!,not spongebob,0
I knew it!,not spongebob,0
"Not so fast!  This card says This was all my idea. Love, Squidward. If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ... help you do it myself.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, he really does care.",not spongebob,0
What a dump.,not spongebob,0
"We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?",not spongebob,0
"Terrific, Patrick, you found it!",spongebob,1
What? Where? Lemme see. Where?,not spongebob,0
"Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.",spongebob,1
"Oh, that figures.",not spongebob,0
"Oh no, this is horrible.",not spongebob,0
"What is it, doctor?",not spongebob,0
This man has no insurance.,not spongebob,0
He'll never be able to afford this room!,not spongebob,0
"You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat!",not spongebob,0
"Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.",spongebob,1
"Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.",not spongebob,0
Why not?,not spongebob,0
"Because that would be rude, Patrick.",spongebob,1
And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
My pleasure. Now let's get a move on.,not spongebob,0
"Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.",spongebob,1
Wow.,not spongebob,0
What are you morons doing?,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.",spongebob,1
Where? I can't see them.,not spongebob,0
Wow.,not spongebob,0
Let's do it again.,not spongebob,0
What did you idiots do?!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch!",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!",spongebob,1
I didn't do it! You blockheads woke...  the... worm.,not spongebob,0
Doctor?,not spongebob,0
"Yes, doctor?",not spongebob,0
"Regarding your patient, doctor. I have come to this conclusion.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, go on.",not spongebob,0
We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar.,not spongebob,0
Of course. Nurse?,not spongebob,0
I'm on it.,not spongebob,0
Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.,spongebob,1
"Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.",not spongebob,0
Understood. Out.,spongebob,1
No! In! Out.,not spongebob,0
Understood. Out.,spongebob,1
"Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?",not spongebob,0
Affirmative.,spongebob,1
Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.,not spongebob,0
"Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.",spongebob,1
Why are we called 'Worm-bait?',not spongebob,0
"I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick!",spongebob,1
And my perfect plan falls into place.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I think I know why our code name is Worm-bait.,not spongebob,0
"Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm!",spongebob,1
"Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.",spongebob,1
See if he plays catch.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy!",spongebob,1
"Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, doctor.",not spongebob,0
"Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?",not spongebob,0
"It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr. Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk.",not spongebob,0
"Yes, yes he is.",not spongebob,0
"What were you thinking, man? We're trying to run a business. We can't leave patients on the sidewalk.",not spongebob,0
Not to worry. Nurse!,not spongebob,0
I'm on it.,not spongebob,0
"Alright, you two, what's the holdup?",not spongebob,0
We feel silly.,spongebob,1
"Come on, do it for old man Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Sure, but first, put on this cologne.",not spongebob,0
Steak sauce?,spongebob,1
"Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell Trick or treat! The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.",not spongebob,0
Gimme that cologne.,not spongebob,0
Now get in there!,not spongebob,0
"Happy Halloween, Squidward!",spongebob,1
I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
That guard worm doesn't look very happy.,not spongebob,0
"Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!",spongebob,1
"It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!",spongebob,1
Trick or treat.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed as meat?",not spongebob,0
"Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Oh, I give up.  Ahhh! Get away!",not spongebob,0
"Nothing like a fresh frozen Krabby Patty with extra freezer burn flavor.  Here we go... Hmm, grill look a tad dirty.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I like to order...",not spongebob,0
"Hold that thought.  SpongeBob, what is all that r...",not spongebob,0
"Uh, so I like to order...",not spongebob,0
Say! Who wants...the first patty from our freshly cleaned grill?!,spongebob,1
I would like a Krabby Patty.!,not spongebob,0
"Okay! How about you, Squid-",spongebob,1
No! I do not want a Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
You suuure?,spongebob,1
Don't touch me.,not spongebob,0
Why don't you want a Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
I've seen what he cleans the grill with.,not spongebob,0
Now all I need is a fresh patty.,spongebob,1
"Hey, where'd all this water come from?  There we go. Oh my stars and garters, the sink is clogged up.  Safety.  Now what seem to be the trouble?  Patrick, what happened?",spongebob,1
"There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then BOOM!  Some dumbbell put this thing in the way.  Whatcha doing?",not spongebob,0
Trying to see what has this sink all backed up. Would you excuse me a second?,spongebob,1
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"Ah-ha!  Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug.  Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug.",spongebob,1
"THE DRAIN PLUG!?!?!?  SpongeBob!!!  What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?",not spongebob,0
"The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug.",spongebob,1
Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?,not spongebob,0
"Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Why don't I, but...hmm...one sec.  Time for a scary story boys. The story......of the Main Drain.  Patrick.",not spongebob,0
Sorry.,not spongebob,0
As I was saying... It happened a long time ago... Patrick! ...to a pair of little kids.,not spongebob,0
Two little kids?,not spongebob,0
"Anyway,  it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell.",not spongebob,0
♪Dadadada-dum-da-dumdumdum.♪,not spongebob,0
Whooooo.,not spongebob,0
"One day, those two kids were wandering through the ocean, when they stumble upon it.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
The Main Drain.,not spongebob,0
"Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em.  And they pulled the plug.  The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down.  The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea!  And nobody was ever heard from...again.",not spongebob,0
"Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Well it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you.  So, so, so get out of here and stay away from that drain! No plugs will be pulled on my watch.",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies.,not spongebob,0
"The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous. I'm never gonna go near that thing.",spongebob,1
We should go find it! To protect it from people like us.,not spongebob,0
What if we get sucked in like those other two kids!,spongebob,1
"Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up!  Hey! A baby tooth!",not spongebob,0
Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?,spongebob,1
Owwwww!,not spongebob,0
Ewwwwww...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Hi Plankton!",spongebob,1
EEEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!,not spongebob,0
Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer.,not spongebob,0
What stupid question do you want the answer to? Idiots.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, and I are trying to find the Main Drain",spongebob,1
"The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, but Mr. Krabs said-",spongebob,1
"Krabs?! Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail. There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea. So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!",not spongebob,0
Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?,not spongebob,0
I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain...,spongebob,1
Old Man Jenkins!,not spongebob,0
Why are you two asking about the Main Drain?,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom.,spongebob,1
So we've been looking for it!,not spongebob,0
Does the Main Drain even exist?,spongebob,1
"Ohhhh, it exists alright. But it's been...uhhh... hushed up.",not spongebob,0
"Where is the Drain oh, wise Jenkins?",spongebob,1
I have no idea.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! We need to find that Drain!,spongebob,1
Why?,not spongebob,0
Isn't your curiosity piqued? What if somebody accidentally pulls it? What if- What if-,spongebob,1
"Oh man, I hope this question;s not for me. I hate questions.",not spongebob,0
"What do you think, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Dah-uhhh! 42. No, triangle! Meatballs! Screwdrivers! Pajamas!",not spongebob,0
I hear ya' Patrick! Let's go find that Main Drain!,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Let's start walkin',spongebob,1
"Oh, no thanks. I'm not into the whole walking thing.",not spongebob,0
"But, Patrick how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?",spongebob,1
Wait for it to come to us.,not spongebob,0
"Hmmmm...I have a better idea!  Well, what do you think?",spongebob,1
I love it!,not spongebob,0
ROAD TRIP!! WOAAAAAH!!!!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's out.",spongebob,1
Hmmmm...,not spongebob,0
I know!!,spongebob,1
AAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!,not spongebob,0
Another miserable day...,not spongebob,0
Ohh. How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?,spongebob,1
Hmmmmm...,not spongebob,0
Oh! Oh! I know exactly what to do!  NEEIIGGHH,not spongebob,0
Owwwwwww. That's better...,not spongebob,0
Doin' great Patrick! We'll be there in no time!,spongebob,1
"Owww. Oh.  Huh, I found it!",not spongebob,0
Wow. Good job...,spongebob,1
Let's pull it.,not spongebob,0
WHAT?!?!?! Why would we do that?!,spongebob,1
"Well, that was the whole point of coming here right?",not spongebob,0
NOOO!!!! We came to see if it was real!,spongebob,1
"Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?",not spongebob,0
We- We don't know...,spongebob,1
We won't know unless we pull it!,not spongebob,0
"But...if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end!",spongebob,1
"And if we don't, we'll never know...",not spongebob,0
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!,not spongebob,0
"Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain! You see...",not spongebob,0
We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug.,not spongebob,0
"That's right one day, Plankton and I were wandering around.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Mother of pearl!,not spongebob,0
"You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it.",not spongebob,0
We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made.,not spongebob,0
Pheeeww. That was a close one...,spongebob,1
"Yeah, We almost messed up big time. Pheeeww.",not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
,not spongebob,0
,not spongebob,0
It's the most realistic story I've ever heard!,not spongebob,0
"Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection.  It's a little land that's all mine!  Now it's snowing in my little land!  It's snowing again!  Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake.  Must have been an aftershock.  Uh, hey! No wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See?",not spongebob,0
"Much, much later...",not spongebob,0
"Snow globes are always funny.  Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks. Oh, hey, do you like to play tag?  Never played it before, huh? Uh, yeah, it's kinda hard to explain. Oh, how about hide-and-seek?  No, no, no, this one's easy. You just close your eyes while the other guy hides, and then you find him and you win. Okay? Ready, uh, now go hide.  1, 2, 3. You can skip a few, 100. Okay, ready or not, here I come!  Hey... Where'd you go? Why are you hiding from me?  This game's harder than I thought!  You want to smell my armpit again?  You win again! Hey, hey! You want to go meet my friend, SpongeBob? Oh, he's a little weird, but you guys will probably get along.  We can play more coral ring toss later.",not spongebob,0
"Dinnertime, Gary! And it's your favorite flavor—crushed anemone byproducts and krill.  What is that horrific banging?  Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!",spongebob,1
"Hey, hey!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's crying out for help!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands!",not spongebob,0
"Gary, this is even worse than yesterday!",spongebob,1
Yesterday...,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, I think your ice machine's broken.",not spongebob,0
Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, you're the owner here, aren't you?",not spongebob,0
That would be me.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I think your ice machine might be broken.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, try telling that guy over there.",not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, the ice machine's broken.",not spongebob,0
Noooo! Why?! Why?! Why?!  Why?!  It was horrible.  Patrick! Patrick!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten.",spongebob,1
"Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him.",not spongebob,0
I would be delighted to meet him.,spongebob,1
"Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?",not spongebob,0
Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me.,spongebob,1
"Okay.  Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"And you are?  Nice to meet you, Mr. Rrarrg!  Well, Rrarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home.",spongebob,1
And this is my home.,not spongebob,0
"Where is your home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home.",spongebob,1
"Doesn't have a home?  Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rrarrg.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, he smashed your house!",spongebob,1
Yeah!  He's gonna smash your house now!,not spongebob,0
"He's going to smash my house?! Gary!  Gary! Jump, Gary, jump!  Parachute, Gary! Use your parachute!",spongebob,1
He's gonna smash Squidward's place now!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick, I don't--",spongebob,1
"Encore!  Wow, the police have arrived.",not spongebob,0
"And they built a cute little fence around Rrarrg.  Hi, Squidward, you're home early.",spongebob,1
"Hold it, buddy. Where are you going?",not spongebob,0
I live here.  And what's so funny?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, the thought of anyone living in a pile of gravel.",not spongebob,0
"I'll have you know, sir, that my home is a-- pile of gravel?!",not spongebob,0
"Sir, don't yell at me. We don't want to alert the--",not spongebob,0
Alert the what?!,not spongebob,0
That big scary monster inside the fence over there.,not spongebob,0
"He waved at you, Squidward! That means he likes you!",spongebob,1
"He likes me? Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see.",not spongebob,0
What do you think he's doing up there?,not spongebob,0
Who?,not spongebob,0
The big guy.,not spongebob,0
I don't know.,not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
I said I don't know.,not spongebob,0
He's escaped!,not spongebob,0
"Quick, everybody into the...  Quick, everybody into the squad car!  Oh, darn it.",not spongebob,0
Now what are we going to do?,not spongebob,0
"We shall have to chase him on foot.  It's headed straight for town!  There, by the magazine stand! Hold it right there, bub!  This is a newsstand, not a library.  Okay, one more step, and I'll sneeze.",not spongebob,0
"Wait just one minute! This is my friend! If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me!",not spongebob,0
We're prepared to do that.,not spongebob,0
Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst.,not spongebob,0
"You mean, that thing can speak?",not spongebob,0
"Of course! He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.",not spongebob,0
That was...  beautiful. We still gotta run him out of town.,not spongebob,0
It really crushes my heart to see him go.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, crushes. Patrick, crushes! That gives me an idea!",spongebob,1
"Yeah? Okay.  Two cubes, please.",not spongebob,0
"Your ice cubes, sir.",spongebob,1
"What? Where?  Hey, thanks, buddy.",not spongebob,0
Don't thank me. Thank Rrarrg!,spongebob,1
"Attention, shoppers: We've got a SpongeBob on Aisle 6.",not spongebob,0
Make a sharp left!,not spongebob,0
We're here!,not spongebob,0
I still don't understand why you had me wear a blindfold.,spongebob,1
"Oh, um, I didn't want you to get anything in your eyes.  See?  Okay, thanks, buddy. I'm going to my club meeting now.",not spongebob,0
"What's your club, hmm?",spongebob,1
"Uh, it's the Empty Head Society. Eh, it's a place where guys like me can give their  powerful intellects a much-needed rest.",not spongebob,0
Whoa! I'd love to rest my intellect. Can I join?,spongebob,1
"Sure! Anyone can join. It's exclusive.  Oh, that's not how you open it.  You have to step on the automatic doormat.  Ding!",not spongebob,0
Wow. They do seem blissfully brainless.,spongebob,1
"Oh, oh, hold it!  You have to check your smart thingy at the door.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, numbskull.",not spongebob,0
"Hiya, dodo!",not spongebob,0
Shall we do the Empty Head handshake?,not spongebob,0
Okay!,not spongebob,0
What was that?,spongebob,1
The signal for the meeting to start. Come on.,not spongebob,0
"Good, I see everyone's in their assigned places. The secretary will now read the minutes.",not spongebob,0
"These are the minutes. One minute, twelve minutes, wait a minute, give me a minute.",not spongebob,0
Hike!  Are there any new initiates here tonight?,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, go up. You always wanted to join the club.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, are you sure you're, uh, brainless enough?  Perfect! You've earned your first badge.  It's time to pass the jar.",not spongebob,0
Hmm?,spongebob,1
Hmm? Uh...,spongebob,1
Drink! Drink! Drink!,not spongebob,0
Drink! Drink! Drink!,not spongebob,0
Ugh!,not spongebob,0
What? You said drink!,spongebob,1
Ahem.  Lemonade?,not spongebob,0
Huh?,spongebob,1
We just save and date the drool. But that was so dopey you earned another badge!  There! It's now time to go out in the community and help the citizens... of Bikini Bottom by doing our civic duty. Whatever that means.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, we're gonna do some civic duty?",spongebob,1
We call it the Nitwitting.,not spongebob,0
"♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks.  But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting. Has anyone seen my socks?♪",not spongebob,0
To the mini boats!,not spongebob,0
To the mini boats!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, why are we doing this, again?",spongebob,1
I have no idea.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, mister. You dropped your ball.",not spongebob,0
Keep running. I'll pace you.,not spongebob,0
These lights could use a smile.,not spongebob,0
I have a feeling you guys are a little confused about what civic duty is.,spongebob,1
"Uh, I don't think so! Civic duty is using your patootie.  No confusion there!",not spongebob,0
Why would people throw their stinky garbage in these beautiful cans?,not spongebob,0
Maybe their pockets were already full.,spongebob,1
Pockets full? I can clearly see you're not as brainless as us.,not spongebob,0
Aww…,spongebob,1
I can't see anything!,not spongebob,0
"Oh well.  I guess I'm just not Empty Head material. Well, bye, buddy.",spongebob,1
My name's Buddy now?,not spongebob,0
Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that's funny. I seem to be lost. Oh, I'll figure it out. I still got so life in the ol' brain stem.",spongebob,1
"What's a brain stem? I know! I'll just walk backwards and that should get me back to the beginning of the day.  I'm even more lost-er than I was before-er.  Oh, I will direct asking— Ask directions.  Excuse me, large lady. I'm a widdle girl who's misplace herself. Can you help find me?  I'm pretty.  Ow!",spongebob,1
Weirdo!,not spongebob,0
"Well, that didn't come out right.",spongebob,1
"Oh, I've forgotten how to sit!",spongebob,1
Obviously not the sharpest tool in the—the tool thing.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, there you are! You forgot your thinking thingy. I wasn't sure which one was yours, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, now my name's Buddy?",spongebob,1
"No, duh. That's my name! I think.",not spongebob,0
"No, not mine.  Wrong brain.  Oh, bad brain. Oh, I guess I'll take this stupid one.",spongebob,1
"Hmm...Hmm... Try saying, I'm ready.",not spongebob,0
"Slime ready! Uh, dime Betty!  Spaghetti! I'm sweaty! I'm all wetty!  I'm ready.  I'm ready! I'm ready! High-five!",spongebob,1
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I know you and the Empty Head Society mean well, but man, we sure messed up a lot of things in town today. So, I'm gonna reverse all the damage that we did during the Nitwitting!",spongebob,1
"Hey, you'd better hurry because you're getting smaller! What a guy. Hmm?  Nothing like a good sit in a chair.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's weird. Everything's already back to normal. What?  Hmm. Well, it's still a mess over here.  Sandy? You cleaned everything up?",spongebob,1
"Of course, SpongeBob. I belong to a club called F.E.M.A.  That stands for Fix the Emptyhead's Mess Again. Our civic duty is repairing the mayhem that the Empty Heads cause every month. You got some gunk on your tie.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, they're badges.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob. How would you like to join F.E.M.A.?",not spongebob,0
"No thanks. After giving my brain a vacation, I need a rest.",spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Uh-oh! Speaking of brain vacation.,not spongebob,0
"♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting…♪",not spongebob,0
♪Has anyone seen my socks?♪,not spongebob,0
I just can't decide what to order.,not spongebob,0
You already ordered.,not spongebob,0
"Don't rush me, young lady!",not spongebob,0
"Hurry up, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
What is taking you so long?,not spongebob,0
I'm adding the love!,spongebob,1
You're not being paid to love.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not here for the money.  I'll always treasure these moments we had together.",spongebob,1
Look!,not spongebob,0
Awww...,spongebob,1
"Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!",not spongebob,0
Krabs!,not spongebob,0
The Jim? He who flipped patties in the before time?,spongebob,1
"You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?!",not spongebob,0
"It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.",not spongebob,0
"Good ol' Jim. When you worked here, the place had class.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, that's new. Employee of the Month, huh?",not spongebob,0
That's me!,spongebob,1
"Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.",not spongebob,0
Your Best Employee Ever award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.,not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir.",spongebob,1
"After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.",not spongebob,0
Would you sign my Krabby Patty?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?",not spongebob,0
"You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!",not spongebob,0
"Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.",not spongebob,0
Yeah. Not unless you look right in front of you!,spongebob,1
"You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!",not spongebob,0
Now I feel complete!,not spongebob,0
Now how about that patty?,not spongebob,0
"Everyone, watch and learn!",not spongebob,0
No one watches Jim.,not spongebob,0
One patty! The right way.,not spongebob,0
It's a thing of beauty!,not spongebob,0
"What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?",spongebob,1
"Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?",not spongebob,0
"I'm the new fry cook, sir.",spongebob,1
"Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?",not spongebob,0
Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?,spongebob,1
Besides don't step on the food?,not spongebob,0
Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!,spongebob,1
Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it!  The pickle slices were too thick.,not spongebob,0
Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Now, too much mustard, see?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, man!",not spongebob,0
Am I a fraud?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?",not spongebob,0
Crying my eyes out.,spongebob,1
"Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.",not spongebob,0
"Why, Squidward?",spongebob,1
"Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!",spongebob,1
"Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!",not spongebob,0
"The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign.  Dear Mr. Krabs,...",spongebob,1
Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0

Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.,not spongebob,0
"Hip, hip, Hooray!",not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain.  Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.",spongebob,1
298 frozen patties later...,not spongebob,0
"Goodbye, freezer.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?",not spongebob,0
"He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!",not spongebob,0
Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.,spongebob,1
"Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.",spongebob,1
"What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.",not spongebob,0
But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.,spongebob,1
"Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions.  We should open our own restaurant and stop relying on old man K's pockets.",not spongebob,0
"No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.",not spongebob,0
What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.",not spongebob,0
"Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?",not spongebob,0
"Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.",not spongebob,0
"Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.",not spongebob,0
What now?,not spongebob,0
"You know, lay a patch.",not spongebob,0
'Scuse me?,not spongebob,0
"Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.",not spongebob,0
"A raise? That's not in my Hiptionary. Help me get with it, Jack.",not spongebob,0
Stop talking like that.,not spongebob,0
These sideburns aren't real.,not spongebob,0
"I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?",not spongebob,0
My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!,not spongebob,0
"Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then.",not spongebob,0
"You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!",not spongebob,0
Wow! I never thought about it that way!,spongebob,1
"So, you'll stay?",not spongebob,0
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Then back to work!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.",not spongebob,0
The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.,spongebob,1
"Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,spongebob,1
"You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!",spongebob,1
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!",spongebob,1
"Uhh, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!,spongebob,1
"Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.",spongebob,1
"Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net.",not spongebob,0
"Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloy netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.",spongebob,1
"Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Good night, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!",spongebob,1

"Oh, right. Pants.",spongebob,1
One pair of pants later...,not spongebob,0

I'm all done.,not spongebob,0
Maybe we should spread out a little.,spongebob,1
Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.,not spongebob,0
This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event.,not spongebob,0
"Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return.",spongebob,1
Reward? How much we talkin' about?,not spongebob,0
12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.,spongebob,1
I'm on the case.,not spongebob,0
"Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on.",not spongebob,0
Oh! Hello? Hello?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, did you get your net back?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?",not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net.",spongebob,1
Hello?!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I found your net!",not spongebob,0
"What?! Really, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever.",spongebob,1
"Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?",not spongebob,0
"No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.",spongebob,1
A present? What is it?,not spongebob,0
It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.,spongebob,1
"Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.,spongebob,1
Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.,not spongebob,0
"Um,  I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, maybe you should talk about it.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.",not spongebob,0
Tell Confess-A-Bear!,not spongebob,0
I've said too much already.,not spongebob,0
Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!,not spongebob,0
"I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear?",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we need to talk.",spongebob,1
"Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?",spongebob,1
I'm in here. Be out in a second.,not spongebob,0
Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.,spongebob,1
Hello.,not spongebob,0
"What's in your hand, Patrick?",spongebob,1
Nothing.,not spongebob,0
What's in your other hand?,spongebob,1
Nothing in my other hand.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I gotta go.",spongebob,1
"Okay, bye.",not spongebob,0
Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he?,spongebob,1
I would kill for a net like that!,not spongebob,0
"Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.  Good morning, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Good morning, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"What are you going to do today, buddy?",spongebob,1
"Eh, nothing.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick.",spongebob,1
Bye.,not spongebob,0
"Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants.",spongebob,1
Eight hours later...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go?",spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?",spongebob,1
"Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?",not spongebob,0
"I don't have any binoculars, see?",spongebob,1
You're acting weird.,not spongebob,0
I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird!  You're... acting... weird!,spongebob,1
"Okay, bye!  Hello! Who are you?",not spongebob,0
"Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.",spongebob,1
Oh. No.,not spongebob,0
Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.,spongebob,1
What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!,not spongebob,0
"Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net.  I will pay one billion dollars for that net.",spongebob,1
"I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net!  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, really?",spongebob,1
You can't have it for any price.,not spongebob,0
And why not?,spongebob,1
This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.,not spongebob,0
A-ha!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick,  I'm the scary mustache guy!",spongebob,1
"Why, SpongeBob, why?! Why would you wear such a scary mustache?",not spongebob,0
Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!,spongebob,1
What?! I'm your best friend!,not spongebob,0
"You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!",spongebob,1
How could you think that?,not spongebob,0
Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!,spongebob,1
Gift.,not spongebob,0
What?,spongebob,1
It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net.,not spongebob,0
For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick?,spongebob,1
"What'cha doing, best friend?",spongebob,1
I'm not your best friend. I'm a no-good jelly netting thief fish!,not spongebob,0
Where are you going?,spongebob,1
I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, no!  So, this is it?",spongebob,1
"Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.",spongebob,1
"What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two.  Look, you left your net on the bus again.",not spongebob,0
Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?,spongebob,1
You do it every week. Now can we get going?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.",spongebob,1
You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, come here, you big lug!",spongebob,1
Aww...,not spongebob,0
"They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.",not spongebob,0
I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!,not spongebob,0
Hooray!,not spongebob,0
You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net.,not spongebob,0
So did I.  My best friend made it for me.,spongebob,1
Whee!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, am I!",not spongebob,0
"Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.",spongebob,1
"First, I have to put away my secret box.",not spongebob,0
Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!,spongebob,1
"Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.",spongebob,1
You do?,not spongebob,0
I've got a gazillion secrets!,spongebob,1
Like what?,not spongebob,0
"Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.",spongebob,1
You wanna hear one of my secrets?,spongebob,1
Do I?,not spongebob,0
Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?,spongebob,1
"No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!",not spongebob,0
Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.,spongebob,1
"Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!",not spongebob,0
"Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the...  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word fancy in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.",spongebob,1
Gasp. I never would have guessed.,not spongebob,0
Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the mystery of the box.  Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna…  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!",not spongebob,0
"But, Patrick, I must know the secret!",spongebob,1
"For the last time, SpongeBob, no!",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick, just a peek?",spongebob,1
"Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!",not spongebob,0
"But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!",spongebob,1
"Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?",spongebob,1
Friends.,not spongebob,0
"What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?",spongebob,1
Meeh… No.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!",spongebob,1
Seee... cret.,not spongebob,0
I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.,spongebob,1
Duh... who's there?,not spongebob,0
Shhh!,spongebob,1
"Eh?!  Who's that?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie.",not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.",spongebob,1
Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!,not spongebob,0
Uh…,spongebob,1
"It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life!",not spongebob,0
"Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!",spongebob,1
"Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.",not spongebob,0
"No, really, Patrick! Look!",spongebob,1
"It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!",not spongebob,0
Our friendship ring! It is you!  How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?,not spongebob,0
"If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.",spongebob,1
"That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.",not spongebob,0
"Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?",spongebob,1
"Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?",not spongebob,0
It's just a string.,spongebob,1
A secret string!,not spongebob,0
"Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!",spongebob,1
"Good night, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!,spongebob,1
"Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the...  ...secret compartment of my secret box...  ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party!  Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Unacceptable!,not spongebob,0
Pearl!,not spongebob,0
"My friends will be here in 20 minutes for my slumber party, and you're laying around in your tighty-no-longer-whities.",not spongebob,0
A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend.,not spongebob,0
"If you trusted me, you would leave for the night.",not spongebob,0
You make Corn Crunch come out me nose!,not spongebob,0
Dad!,not spongebob,0
"Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt.",not spongebob,0
You promise?,not spongebob,0
I promise.,not spongebob,0
"Good night, daddy.",not spongebob,0
"Good night, sweetie.",not spongebob,0
Dad!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, hi, pumpkin. I was just setting out refreshments for you and your friends.",not spongebob,0
Crackers and tap water? You are the cheapest crab alive!,not spongebob,0
"Now don't say that. Here, would your friends like some pizza?",not spongebob,0
"Well, yeah. Yeah, we would.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, you can have your allowance early.",not spongebob,0
Ketchup?!,not spongebob,0
"See, you put it on the crackers,  and a mamma mia, you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay, I'm going.",not spongebob,0
Oh! They're here!  Hi!  Dad?,not spongebob,0
Just putting up the house rules.,not spongebob,0
"No dancing, no loud music after 7:30, no touching the root beer cellar?!",not spongebob,0
"And the most important one in all, no boys allowed!  Isn't it glorious?  Sweetie, you accidentally locked the door!",not spongebob,0
You’re not coming back in this house until after my slumber party is over!,not spongebob,0
This is mutiny!,not spongebob,0
What are you gonna do about it? Take away my allowance?  Here you go!,not spongebob,0
Open this door or I'll...,not spongebob,0
You wanna stay here? At my house? With me?,spongebob,1
"Whaddya say, boy?",not spongebob,0
Yee-hee! Slumber party!,spongebob,1
Maybe I should just sleep under the highway.,not spongebob,0
"We can stay up really, really late! And tell ghost stories! And trade socks!",spongebob,1
Is that what girls do at slumber parties?,not spongebob,0
No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!,spongebob,1
They what?!,not spongebob,0
You know how girls are.,spongebob,1
"Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?",not spongebob,0
Do I know any... no. But Gary does.,spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
We now return to tonight’s scary movie: Slumber Party Zombie Attack!,not spongebob,0
Pillow fight!  That tickles! Missed me!,not spongebob,0
Look what they’re doing to that man’s house!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it’s only a mov-",spongebob,1
"Quiet, boy!",not spongebob,0
Boys are here!,not spongebob,0
"Hi, girls. I brought my destructive friends.",not spongebob,0
Nice to  meet you!,not spongebob,0
Ha! Destroying other people's possessions is fun!,not spongebob,0
"Turn it off! Turn it off, I can’t take it!",not spongebob,0
I don't think this is the scary part yet.,spongebob,1
I… said… turn it off!,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies.",spongebob,1
"Not zombies, you barnacle brain!  Teenagers.",not spongebob,0
Zombie teenagers?,spongebob,1
"No! Pearl and her no-good friends! They're probably destroying me house right now! Like this!  Oops! I don't care! It’s not mine!  Oh, look! One of the home owner's most prized possessions!  La-di-da!",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs...,spongebob,1
"Ooh, this'll be fun to destroy!  Whee!  Now do you get it, boy?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect!",spongebob,1
That's what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?,not spongebob,0
"Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Then get into Pearl's party and find out what they’re doing!,not spongebob,0
"Leave it to me, Mr. K. I've got the perfect disguise.",spongebob,1
Hello?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, I'm here for the slumber party.",not spongebob,0
Do I know you?,not spongebob,0
My name is... um... Girly TeenGirl!,not spongebob,0
Uh-huh.,not spongebob,0
"Um, I just moved here from... um... Farawayville.",not spongebob,0
"I know it's you, SpongeBob SquarePants!",not spongebob,0
I don't know what you're talking about!,not spongebob,0
"You were sent to spy on me by my dad! Get him, girls!",not spongebob,0
I am so moving back to Farawayville!,not spongebob,0
Who the heck is that?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about.  Ta-daaaah! Huh? Huh? Huh?",spongebob,1
"You are one of a kind, boy.",not spongebob,0
Pizza delivery.,spongebob,1
We didn’t order any pizza!,not spongebob,0
Y-You didn't?,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, tell 'em it's from me!",not spongebob,0
Your dad sent it. It's already paid for.,spongebob,1
"I’d sooner believe space aliens sent me a free pizza before I'd believe my dad would! Now, who are you?",not spongebob,0
Um.. uh...  Hey!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"They're on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!",spongebob,1
"Right, boy!",not spongebob,0
"I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Get him!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, big surprise. Dad was too cheap to buy real pizza!",not spongebob,0
What's taking SpongeBob so long? I'm getting tired of looking through his stuff.,not spongebob,0
Hello?  Pizza!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you.",spongebob,1
"I know, son.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, that’s my eye!",spongebob,1
"And it's ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less!",not spongebob,0
Who is it?,not spongebob,0
Piano repair man!,spongebob,1
Okay! We'll be right out!,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, it's working!",spongebob,1
Have it back by tomorrow. Okay?,not spongebob,0
"Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy.",spongebob,1
"You get into that party, or you're fired!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
Whoever could it be this time?,not spongebob,0
"It's me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?",spongebob,1

"Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!",spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
Give me one good reason why I can't stay!,spongebob,1
I can give you a hundred million billion reasons!,not spongebob,0
"Yeesh, I only asked for one.",spongebob,1
Reason number one: you're just like my dad!,not spongebob,0
Really?!,spongebob,1
"A no-good, dried-up, old fuddy-duddy!",not spongebob,0
"So if I prove I'm fun, can I stay?",spongebob,1
"Sure, SpongeBob. If you can prove you're the most fun person on the planet in the next ten seconds, you could stay.",not spongebob,0
I only need eight!,spongebob,1
Whoo! Party!  Crank it up!,spongebob,1
Five seconds.,not spongebob,0
These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!,spongebob,1
"I’m allergic to newsprint!  Oh, ow!",not spongebob,0
"Two seconds!  Okay, okay, I got to admit. That was kinda fun.",not spongebob,0
I think he's hurt.,not spongebob,0
He's not hurt.  See?,not spongebob,0
Maybe he's a zombie!,not spongebob,0
"If he comes back as a zombie and eats my brain, I'm totally not going to be your friend anymore!",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. Fun!",spongebob,1
We now return to Slumber Party Zombie Attack!,not spongebob,0
A zombie!,not spongebob,0
This movie isn’t all that scary!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, that zombie looks totally fake!",not spongebob,0
Party!,spongebob,1
Zombie!,not spongebob,0

Zombie juice!,not spongebob,0
Run!,not spongebob,0
Who wants to dance?,spongebob,1
No! I already have a zombie boyfriend!,not spongebob,0
Let's boogie! Whoo!,spongebob,1
What in Neptune's toupee is going on here?  Me knick-knacks!  Me root beer!  Me pile of old newspapers!  I was maybe gonna read that someday!  I knew I shouldn't have trusted you!,not spongebob,0
Trusted me?! Your employee destroyed this house!  The only boy at the party!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are.  Ow!",spongebob,1
"It's your fault my party is ruined, and all my friends have zombie shock syndrome!",not spongebob,0
I'm too pretty to be a zombie!,not spongebob,0
"We were fine with a nice simple slumber party. But now, it's gonna cost you!",not spongebob,0
Cost me what?!,not spongebob,0
Money....!,not spongebob,0
NOOO!!,not spongebob,0
"Everyone having a good time?  Well, you can all thank my dad for making this possible! Thank you, Daddy!",not spongebob,0
"You're welcome, sweetie!  Oh, this is so expensive!",not spongebob,0
"You're not allowed any closer, sir.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I think I know what'll cheer you up.  A mug of ice cold root beer!",spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, that doesn't cheer me up at all!",not spongebob,0
Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...,not spongebob,0
Free drinks...,not spongebob,0
Free light bulbs?,not spongebob,0
"Aha! Top of the mornin', boys!  Whew! Next stop: gift shop.",not spongebob,0
"There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!",spongebob,1
"He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!",spongebob,1
Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!,not spongebob,0
This is the greatest day of our lives!,not spongebob,0
This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.,not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air!  Right? I'll try my oyster call.",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, come on, wake up already!  I think it's working!",spongebob,1
"Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!",spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, did I miss it?",not spongebob,0
"No, the show's about to begin!",spongebob,1
What's wrong with Clamu?,not spongebob,0
"Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?",not spongebob,0
"Now, this is a show!",not spongebob,0
"Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles.  Thanks for coming.",not spongebob,0
"You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster.  You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?",not spongebob,0
Uh...,spongebob,1
"No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Right.,spongebob,1
"Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like you... and... are ... and... a jerk!  Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?",not spongebob,0
"I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!",spongebob,1
"Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!",not spongebob,0
"Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home!  Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.",spongebob,1
"Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world.  A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens!  What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures?",not spongebob,0
Meow?,not spongebob,0
"No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?",spongebob,1
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?!,not spongebob,0

Um... have you found out anything?,spongebob,1

"I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!",spongebob,1

I was sure I was dead, but then I wasn't, but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?",spongebob,1

"That's a great idea, Potty.  Where's the remote?  Where's the remote?  Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things...  Eh...",not spongebob,0
Brawk!,not spongebob,0
"My remote!  Thanks, stranger!",not spongebob,0

Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.,not spongebob,0

Brawk. Failure ahoy.,not spongebob,0
"No!  Stop! Stop! Go back, infernal machine!  Oh no! I've ruined the lost episode! Now it's lost forever!",not spongebob,0
Brawk! Lost forever!,not spongebob,0
"Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds.  Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost.",not spongebob,0
"It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television.",not spongebob,0

Okay.,spongebob,1
Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television.,not spongebob,0

"If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,spongebob,1
"You're still there, aren't you?",not spongebob,0
"Good evening, Squidward.",spongebob,1
Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?",spongebob,1
Yeah. We're here...,not spongebob,0
"Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob?! Patrick?! Oh, what's the point?",not spongebob,0
Could you turn it up?,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?",spongebob,1
"Squidward, what's this about?",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, how come he's so emotional?",spongebob,1
Is he the bad guy?,not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1

Squidward?,not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen! Once again, I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet!  Enjoy my TV! PFAH!",not spongebob,0
"Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.",not spongebob,0
"I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. PFAH! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields.",not spongebob,0
"What is that thing, Patrick?",spongebob,1
I dunno. Let's get a closer look.,not spongebob,0
"Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, help him. Go away! Can't you tell nobody wants you?! You're endangered!",not spongebob,0
"Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.",spongebob,1
And some kibble.,not spongebob,0
"You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly, meet Gary.  Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary!",spongebob,1
I don't think Gary likes Smelly.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.",spongebob,1
Ah! He can come live with me.,not spongebob,0
"That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's.",spongebob,1
"No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control?! There's a wild animal loose in my house!  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back! Smelly!",not spongebob,0
Freeze!,not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, what's all the commotion?",spongebob,1
You're surrounded. There is no way out.,not spongebob,0
"Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.",spongebob,1
"Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em, boys.",not spongebob,0
Smelly.,spongebob,1
"Mommy, what is that thing?",not spongebob,0
"I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it?",not spongebob,0
This isn't good.,spongebob,1
You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.,not spongebob,0
"No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?",spongebob,1
"Oh, yeah.  This one, right?",not spongebob,0
"No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.",spongebob,1
"Mmm, good plan.",not spongebob,0
"All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me.",spongebob,1
You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah!,not spongebob,0
"Shh, we'll get caught.",spongebob,1
What?! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud!,not spongebob,0
"Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free!",spongebob,1
You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.,not spongebob,0
"Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick.",spongebob,1
I'll let Smelly go first.,not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us.",spongebob,1
I think we lost them.,not spongebob,0
"Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.",spongebob,1
"La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much.",spongebob,1
"Hey, I see light.",not spongebob,0
"You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way.",spongebob,1
"I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong.",spongebob,1

That is what we in karate call; the Smell of Death!,not spongebob,0
You know kah-ra-tay?,spongebob,1

Gee...I wish I had a karate belt,spongebob,1

Hm?,spongebob,1

Um...sorry. I'm confused.,spongebob,1
I am here to separate that wheat from the chaff! No?  That last one usually works...,not spongebob,0
What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.,not spongebob,0
But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?,spongebob,1
"It is simple. I conduct a series of tests, and if you pass,  I'll give you a belt that shows you know karate.",not spongebob,0
"The first test is simple. Split a log with one hand chop, like so.  Your turn,  Karate Man.",not spongebob,0

Please proceed.,not spongebob,0

No more talk! Only do!,not spongebob,0
Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow!,not spongebob,0

Here...I'm right here... I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired...,spongebob,1
You sure you want to do this buddy?,not spongebob,0
"Enough talk! If you want your belt, you gonna have to tussle it out! So let the match begin!",not spongebob,0
Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!,spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first!",not spongebob,0
"Most impressive, Sandy. But I am here to evaluate SpongeBob.  Let's see what he can do on the offensive!",not spongebob,0
Okay Sandy!  Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper!,spongebob,1
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Very good, Sandy! You put your opponent to sleep in under a minute!  Too bad your opponent didn't put up a fight. I was prepared to give you the lowest of belts,  The Clear Belt!  But now, I realize you're unfit to wear a belt of any kind, including the one that holds up your pants!",not spongebob,0
"Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.",not spongebob,0
"Easy for you to say, Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.",spongebob,1
And I'm revoking your black belt!,not spongebob,0
Hey! You can't do that!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, yes I can! For wasting my time bringing me this sorry, excuse for a student! Stick to something you're good at, son.",not spongebob,0
Yes Sensei...,spongebob,1
"That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend.",not spongebob,0
The Sponge-One will never earn his belt.,not spongebob,0
I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!,not spongebob,0
"Silence! No more chances! Sensei never gives two chances! If you really want to impress me, show me where I can get a decent meal around here. Lunch time approaches.",not spongebob,0
That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!,not spongebob,0
Who're you talking to?,not spongebob,0
"Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!",not spongebob,0
Squidward I...I failed my karate exam...,spongebob,1
"Which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!",not spongebob,0
"Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right!",spongebob,1
You sure you don't need an air helmet?,not spongebob,0
This won't take long. Fuzzy has trained himself to go hours without air.,not spongebob,0
How about them moves?,not spongebob,0
Pretty okay...for a fry cook!,not spongebob,0

He's on the offensive!  Time for you to end this!,not spongebob,0

"You brought me to the dance, but the universe is cutting in!",not spongebob,0

Oh no!,not spongebob,0
Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?,spongebob,1
"I was wrong about you, SpongeBob. You have bested Fuzzy, with your karate greatness!  You are now a karate master!",not spongebob,0
"For me? Thanks, Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible!  Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?",spongebob,1
I know what he needs! He just needs this!,not spongebob,0

"Okay, I will!",not spongebob,0
How does that help?,spongebob,1
"Well, now that my all over hurts, I'm not thinking about my mouth.  Ow! I guess that didn't work!",not spongebob,0
"That's it! I'm taking you to the dentist, Patrick.",spongebob,1
No way! I've heard horror stories!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't worry, Patrick. Dentists are our friends.  Huh? Patrick? Patrick?",spongebob,1
Oh.,spongebob,1
And we have a winner.,not spongebob,0
Thank you!,spongebob,1

Aww. Coochie coo!,spongebob,1
I still have a baby tooth?,not spongebob,0
Yes.  And the pain is coming from your adult tooth trying to push your baby tooth out of the way.,not spongebob,0
That's not right!,not spongebob,0
"It's the natural way of things.  If you want the pain to go away, then I need to extract the tooth.",not spongebob,0
"You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, come back!",spongebob,1
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island.",spongebob,1
Tooth Island?,not spongebob,0
Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows.,spongebob,1
Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can be free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities.,spongebob,1
"Hey, come on over! Come on!",not spongebob,0

It is baloney!,not spongebob,0
Who's got baloney?,not spongebob,0
"There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!",not spongebob,0
Eew!,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, why would you want to do that?",spongebob,1
"I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy.",spongebob,1
"That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage.",not spongebob,0
"You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out.",spongebob,1
You'll have to catch me first!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, wait!",spongebob,1
"Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!",not spongebob,0
The worms!,not spongebob,0
Not wanted. That fixes it.,not spongebob,0
"Mipsey, Pipsey, you bad girls! You get back on this leash!",not spongebob,0
"You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, they weren't mine.",spongebob,1
A likely story!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, can I show you something?",spongebob,1
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth.  Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart.",spongebob,1
I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?",spongebob,1
Don't listen to him! I still have all my baby teeth and look at me!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, SpongeBob. We can go.",not spongebob,0
"I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do.",not spongebob,0
I'm done.,not spongebob,0
That's it?,not spongebob,0
That's it.,not spongebob,0
You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, you don't understand! I'm just helping to get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy!",spongebob,1
"Oh, that's a good one.",not spongebob,0
It's true!,spongebob,1
How can I believe you? All the lies!  The chicanery!,not spongebob,0
"Look at how betrayed Patrick feels! Oh, this was totally worth staying up all night.",not spongebob,0
"You don't believe there's a Tooth Fairy? Well, follow me and I'll show ya.",spongebob,1
"Behold, the Tooth Ferry!",spongebob,1
This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island.,spongebob,1
There really is a Tooth Ferry!,not spongebob,0
Of course.,spongebob,1
All aboard!,not spongebob,0
Hello!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, here. This is yours.",spongebob,1
Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?,not spongebob,0
"Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal.",spongebob,1
"Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?",not spongebob,0
"Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy: They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!",not spongebob,0
"Open wide, Squidward!",spongebob,1
No.,not spongebob,0
You're it!,not spongebob,0
Not for long!,spongebob,1
"Hey, try to catch me, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Tag, you're it.",spongebob,1
"Oh, this game's too hard!",not spongebob,0
I know! What if both of us are it?,spongebob,1
"But then, who's gonna be not it?",not spongebob,0
Exactly! Neither of us will know!,spongebob,1
"Oh, I like not knowing! Let's play!",not spongebob,0
I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it! I'm it!,not spongebob,0
I'm it!,spongebob,1
"I'm it!  SpongeBob!  Hang on, buddy, I'm coming! Ahhhh!",not spongebob,0
"Whoa, what is this place?",spongebob,1
"Look at all this cool stuff!  I'm the captain!  Yo, ho, ho, ya mateys! Arr!  Got ya! En garde!  Thanks, SpongeBob. I guess we better be more careful.",not spongebob,0
Let's go back to the main deck.,spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Patrick!  I'm coming, buddy! Patrick?  Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Ooh, shiny and smooth.",not spongebob,0
"Wow, what's this?  Mauna Loa.  Oh, I'm late! Gotta get to work!",spongebob,1
"♪Mauna Loa, how I love ya, oh, my secret lovin' hideaway! My Mauna Loa bay-a bay!♪",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob! What are you doing? I've been saying I needed a Krabby Patty about a bajillion times! And you w— What the...? Ha ha ha! Nice patty, Michelangelo! Ha!  I hope you're not expecting an award anytime soon.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's just my secret—  Here you go.",spongebob,1
Porous freak.,not spongebob,0
"Whew, that was a close one!",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob, check out the new t-shirt I just made!  Secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hide—",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, please! What are you trying to do?! Give away our secret hideout?! Give me that!",spongebob,1
What's all the racket?!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry, sir.",spongebob,1
"Patrick, if you're going to distract me fry cook, the least you can do is buy some grub!",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Back to work, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Sure thing.  Arr! Oh, looks like the work day's over. See you tomorrow, sir!",spongebob,1
That's odd.,not spongebob,0
"Hmm, well, let's see.",not spongebob,0
"Come on, Patrick. We've got to get back to our playground.",spongebob,1
"Keep the change, my good man!",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says Mauna Loa.",not spongebob,0
"Mauna Loa?! As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa? Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies... in its ruins. I have been searching for this treasure nearly me entire adult life! Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every dumpster. Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!",not spongebob,0
"Well, I guess that explains this.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves. Come on, Squidward. We got to let those two ding-a-lings lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!",not spongebob,0
"Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but have fun with that.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?",spongebob,1
"Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?",not spongebob,0
Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?,spongebob,1
"No. It's just a secret that everybody knows about.  What's wrong, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Just as I thought. We're being followed. That's it!  Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!",spongebob,1
Found it!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, were you following us?",spongebob,1
No. I just saw the sign.,not spongebob,0
"So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr. Krabs, did ya?",not spongebob,0
"I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?!  You're a stonewall, eh? We'll see about that!  Where'd you two blunders find the gold coin?",not spongebob,0
"If my eyes weren't burning like they were full of lava, I could show you.",spongebob,1
"Heh, jokers.",not spongebob,0
"I knew I'd find it! Check it out, fellas, cool, hard doubloons!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, you might want to take a closer look at your coinage.",spongebob,1
Eh? What's this? Token Has No Monetary Value? Tokens?! This must be a decoy.,not spongebob,0
"Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Maybe they hid the loot off ship in that shed!",spongebob,1
"Whee-hee! What the barnacle? Well, it's just full of tickets!",not spongebob,0
"Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth.",spongebob,1
Ticket booth?!,not spongebob,0
And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?,spongebob,1
Must Be This Tall To Ride?,not spongebob,0
"Well, maybe they had something against short people. I like their little clothes.",not spongebob,0
"Captain's Quarters. There must be some treasure here, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"Out of me way, boy.  I knew it. The lost treasure of the Mauna Loa is finally mine! I can practically taste them jewels.  It's a little lighter than I thought. Huh? It's empty.  No good. Ha, ha, very clever, captain. Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens? It's not the Wreck of the Mauna Loa, It's The Wreck of the Mauna Loa amusement park ride!",not spongebob,0
No wonder we were so amused!,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not!",not spongebob,0
"Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout.",spongebob,1
This place ain't got no treasure! Keep your worthless hunk of junk!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!",spongebob,1
"Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun.  Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas. Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!",not spongebob,0
Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa. Arr. How may I help you?,not spongebob,0
"I'll take 10 tokens, please.",not spongebob,0
"Step right up, don't be shy! Experience the amusement and terror of The Wreck of the Mauna Loa!",not spongebob,0
"That's right, folks! We spare no expense to restore this plastic ship to its former glory!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, honey, but you'll have to come back when you're a big boy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh-ho-ho, I disagree. I'd say the little  feller's just right.",not spongebob,0
"It's gone, Patrick. Our secret paradise is gone forever!",spongebob,1
"And alas, even the joyous shrieks of children cannot lift my sunken heart!",not spongebob,0
How 'bout another ride to cheer you up?,spongebob,1
Let's do this!,not spongebob,0
"Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha! Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!",not spongebob,0
That was awesome!,spongebob,1
Yeah! Totally realistic!,not spongebob,0
Realistic? That realism nearly cost us our lives!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs put all our lives in danger with this careless contraption!,not spongebob,0
What were you thinking? Our little boy could've been hurt on your disaster of a ride!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!",not spongebob,0
"Too late for that, Krabs.",not spongebob,0
What—what—what are you talking about? You can't take me to the pokey! I—,not spongebob,0
"For operating a danger to public safety I can, and I will. Honestly, I think he'll be safer in prison.",not spongebob,0
"Well, Patrick, I guess we really lost our secret hideout this time.",spongebob,1
"And just when everyone was starting to find out about it, too.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, who knows, Patrick? The next fun, fun place might be just around the corner, huh?",spongebob,1
"Well, I doubt it.",not spongebob,0
"The Real Mauna Loa? Ooh, Patrick, do you want to keep a secret?",spongebob,1
Nope!,not spongebob,0

Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I need that order of six.",not spongebob,0
"Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything.",spongebob,1
Uh— yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: That which is fried, must be eaten.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is.",not spongebob,0
Where's my Krabby Patty?,not spongebob,0
"Right here, muscleboy.",not spongebob,0
It's about time.,not spongebob,0

"Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing.",spongebob,1
"What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it?",not spongebob,0
Great idea.,spongebob,1
I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.,not spongebob,0
"Enjoy, sir.",spongebob,1
"Can I eat this one?  What....? Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe.",not spongebob,0
"What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!",spongebob,1

"SpongeBob, how about another game of—  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.",spongebob,1
"Hi-yah!  Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.",spongebob,1
"Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for beboppin' all over Timbuktu.",not spongebob,0

Yuck.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.",spongebob,1
Your date's a...Krabby Patty?  Methinks the boy's really lost it.,not spongebob,0
What's that putrid odor?,not spongebob,0

"Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?",spongebob,1
"I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?",not spongebob,0

Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping!,spongebob,1
Can we come?!,not spongebob,0
"This is ain't no ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild, armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite . Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten. You have to be willing to do anything when you're alone in the wild. You two wouldn't last a single day!",not spongebob,0
Hey!,spongebob,1
Would so!,not spongebob,0
"We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills!  The Other Day",spongebob,1

"But, Sandy...!",not spongebob,0
No!,not spongebob,0
Ohhh...,not spongebob,0
Sshhh! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!  I guess the road smoothed out.  That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us!,spongebob,1
Weird. There's a door back here too?,not spongebob,0
"No, Patrick! No!  Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub.  Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter...",spongebob,1
And a nice fire to keep us warm.,not spongebob,0
"Say, where did you get the firewood?  You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something!  Hey Patrick, nice job.",spongebob,1
"Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we are going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!",spongebob,1
Gotcha.,not spongebob,0
Okay. Here's the plan...,spongebob,1
"Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. You made the last decision. It's my turn.",not spongebob,0
"Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?",spongebob,1
"Um...maybe,...uh...",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Patrick?",spongebob,1
"Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, sorry, take your time.",spongebob,1
Uhhh...  Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!,not spongebob,0
No hurry Patrick.,spongebob,1
Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?,not spongebob,0
Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there.,spongebob,1

"Huh? Nice. We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow.",spongebob,1
Home? This is your new home. You'll be here forever just like me!,not spongebob,0
"Aahh, good times.",not spongebob,0
What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?,spongebob,1
40 years I've been here. There's ain't no way out of this valley. You're stuck in here' with me for the rest of your lives!,not spongebob,0
We'll be here forever? We're doomed!,spongebob,1
"Are you kidding? That old coot's been here for years! Look at him: he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health.",not spongebob,0
"You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep?",spongebob,1
"I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home.  There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller,  comfy, safe and sound in my own little home.",spongebob,1
"Safe? You're never safe out in the wild! If I were you, I'd keep an eye on that big fella.",not spongebob,0
Patrick?  Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me.,spongebob,1
"He's a big boy! Just wait 'til when he gets hungry! Out here, it's eat or be eaten!",not spongebob,0
He's got the taste of flesh!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Hey, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Sounds like you're hungry.,spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, am I! I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge...",not spongebob,0
...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too!,not spongebob,0
It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?,spongebob,1
You've got to protect yourself! What you need is a fort!,not spongebob,0
"This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick!  He's onto me! Must hide! . Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, , I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here!  Spatula.  Now I just need some buns.  Oh, crunchy.  I can't take it!  I need some real food!",spongebob,1
"Remember, kid, it's eat or be eaten.",not spongebob,0
Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee!,spongebob,1
"Something smells good. What are you cooking, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!,spongebob,1
Why do you want to eat me?,not spongebob,0
"I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!",spongebob,1
"Well, not if I eat you first!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no you don't!  Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this?  Warm water?",spongebob,1
"You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, thanks, Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?",spongebob,1
"Oops, I forgot the bathbeads!",not spongebob,0

To find Nicktoons Animation Studio  and meet his idol  face to face for the first time  in  ten years...it's ten years ago.  It's ten years ago.  Let's see what happens, yeah.",not spongebob,0

"Sir, may I help you?",not spongebob,0

"Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir.",not spongebob,0
That's okay. I can wait.  SpongeBob?!,not spongebob,0
"Sir, please step away from the gate.",not spongebob,0

"Pearl, and her boyfriend SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
So there you have it. As time quickly runs out  still no word from the imperiled whale girl and SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! I'm out of coral on a stick!  Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!",not spongebob,0
"At this time survival looks bleek, for the little yellow sponge.",not spongebob,0
Nooooooo! This is my worst nightmare! I don't have a drink!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, doofus!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Your best buddy is trapped in the tunnel of glove and he may never escape!,not spongebob,0
You mean SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
"I'm coming, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
Hold it! No one beyond this point!,not spongebob,0
My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!,not spongebob,0
"No can do, big guy. Too dangerous.",not spongebob,0
"Fine!  Well, mister police guy won't let me in the front, huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!",not spongebob,0
"Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be?  Aha!  Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend!  Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you, buddy!  SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh, there you are!  Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles!  You're okay now, buddy! Go to your happy place! .",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, little girl! We're working as fast as we can!",not spongebob,0
"That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, little boy!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for . Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS.",spongebob,1
"Well, whatever, SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.",spongebob,1
Fine. After you.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... Snakes!",spongebob,1
"Those are streamers, fool!",not spongebob,0
Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.,spongebob,1
"Oh, grow up, SpongeBob!  There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and...",spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Or ghostly pirates!   Or laboratory creatures!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Or green beings from another planet!,spongebob,1
"Okay, SpongeBob. Okay.",not spongebob,0
Or bus drivers!,spongebob,1
"Ah, that's enough!",not spongebob,0
Shhh. Did you hear that?,spongebob,1
"Now I'm scared, SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
It sounded like a crawly were-clown.,spongebob,1
But there's no such thing!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, he's here.",spongebob,1
"A ha ha ha, he.",spongebob,1
"Not another skunk! How did you beat me again?  Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey, I am talking towards you.",not spongebob,0
Did you see the dimwit who ripped this apart?,not spongebob,0
"I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I do know that you've kidnapped SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
I don't know about your best friend. I'm just the electrician.,not spongebob,0
Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.,not spongebob,0
You need to relax. Have a seat and cool off.,not spongebob,0
Geez. Some people are so pushy.,not spongebob,0
Just don't sit on THE LEVER!,not spongebob,0
Oops.,not spongebob,0
Now the whole ride is stuck on Dangerous Super Fast Mode!,not spongebob,0
You told me to sit on it.,not spongebob,0
What was that?,spongebob,1
"I don't know. Hold me, SpongeBob",not spongebob,0
Huh!,not spongebob,0
Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!,spongebob,1
"Okay, okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall.",not spongebob,0
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,not spongebob,0
Wow! How romantical.,spongebob,1
Pssssst. I imagined it bigger.,not spongebob,0
"Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub.  Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil!",spongebob,1
Stupid kid.,not spongebob,0
Nice facilities. Great water pressure.,not spongebob,0
Neptune's mother!,not spongebob,0
What's that?,spongebob,1
,not spongebob,0
Uhhhhhh!,not spongebob,0
She's gonna blow! Noooooo!,not spongebob,0
I guess that turned out to be pretty fun.,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,spongebob,1
SpongeBob is your boyfriend.,not spongebob,0
How many times to I have to say it? Eww! Gross!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, don't deny it. You were totally hugging him, and everyone knows that totally means he's totally your boyfriend.",not spongebob,0
"Howdy, kids!",not spongebob,0
Crawly clown! Crawly clown!,spongebob,1
"You understand, girls. For posterity!",not spongebob,0
Are you gonna finish that?,not spongebob,0
"And how is everything for you today, sir?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, it's great! Just great!",not spongebob,0
"Fine, fine.",not spongebob,0
I just love this Krabby Patty!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, okay, always nice to hear.",not spongebob,0
My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties!  So luxurious!,not spongebob,0
You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!,not spongebob,0
No extra. It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty.,not spongebob,0
"Argh!  Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?!",not spongebob,0
"I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns.",not spongebob,0
My patty tastes like sadness.,not spongebob,0
"All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors...  ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!",not spongebob,0
What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.,not spongebob,0
"Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offense.",not spongebob,0
None taken.,not spongebob,0
Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it.,not spongebob,0
"Let me grab a pencil.  Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.",not spongebob,0
"Avast there, lad!  You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  Oh, I can't even cry right!",spongebob,1
"There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!",spongebob,1
How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, about $100 a semester.",spongebob,1
"$100 a semester?!  Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!",not spongebob,0
Really?,spongebob,1
"Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes.",not spongebob,0
"Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl.",not spongebob,0
"Thanks, Daddy!",not spongebob,0
"Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a...  professional to teach you how to drive.",not spongebob,0
"You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff...",spongebob,1
"Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.",not spongebob,0
It is?,spongebob,1
"And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!",not spongebob,0
Okay!,spongebob,1
"Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.",not spongebob,0
It does?,spongebob,1
"No, but you got the right fire in your belly.",not spongebob,0
I do?,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.",not spongebob,0
"This empty parking lot is just the ticket.  Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, you're so wise.",spongebob,1
"Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear!  Hmm.",not spongebob,0
"Rookie mistake, right?",spongebob,1
I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.,not spongebob,0
"Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch.",spongebob,1
"Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand.  Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh.   All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face.  Bleah! Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs?",not spongebob,0
"Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'll say.",spongebob,1
"Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night.  Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house.",not spongebob,0
Patrick's house!,spongebob,1
"I'll have one Krabby Patty, please.",not spongebob,0
Okay.,not spongebob,0
Upsell!,not spongebob,0
Would you like fries with that?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, sounds good.",not spongebob,0
Better.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, Put 'er into gear.",not spongebob,0
You missed one.,not spongebob,0
A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.,not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk.",spongebob,1
"Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat.  Or can ye?",not spongebob,0
"You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.",not spongebob,0
Now hand me one of them tokens.  You'll need your protective headgear.,not spongebob,0
Ready? Drive!,not spongebob,0
"I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat!  Uh-oh.",spongebob,1
Sixth place!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!",spongebob,1
"Great job, boy.",not spongebob,0
Phew.,not spongebob,0
"Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time.",spongebob,1
Saw that coming.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... ]",spongebob,1
"No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah.",spongebob,1
"You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?",not spongebob,0
You never!,spongebob,1
"That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping.",not spongebob,0
Snapping!,spongebob,1
"Oh, my gosh.",spongebob,1
"Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!",not spongebob,0
"Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go!  Atta boy!  There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, yeah, some of it.",spongebob,1
"Buck up, me boy-o.  It's your turn next.",not spongebob,0
"My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me.",spongebob,1
Not really.,not spongebob,0
"Sir, is this your vehicle?",not spongebob,0
"Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.",not spongebob,0
And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection?,not spongebob,0
"You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example.  I was teaching the lad to drive.",not spongebob,0
By putting a snail behind the wheel.,not spongebob,0
"Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.",not spongebob,0
Meow.,not spongebob,0
"Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but...",spongebob,1
"Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.",not spongebob,0
"Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir?",not spongebob,0
"Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?",not spongebob,0
"No, I'm married to my job.",not spongebob,0
"Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues.",not spongebob,0
"This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.",not spongebob,0
Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.,spongebob,1
"Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir.",not spongebob,0
Ha! What could be worse than spending money?,not spongebob,0
"All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
"Hello, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes.",spongebob,1
"One, two, three, four...",not spongebob,0
I declare a thumb war!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
Yah!,spongebob,1
"Now that was a great thumb war, mister!",not spongebob,0
"It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony.",spongebob,1
,not spongebob,0
"Great job, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot!",not spongebob,0
"Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great!",spongebob,1
"Boy, these Krabby Patties are delicious.",not spongebob,0
I'll say. They're absolutely stupendous.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you guys are stupendous customers.",spongebob,1
That thumbs-up really touched my heart.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, me too. It's like there's a thumbprint of happiness on my aorta.",not spongebob,0
Flipping.,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like I told to do?",not spongebob,0
"I sure have, Mr. Krabs. Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss.",spongebob,1
"Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say. Now back to work!",not spongebob,0
"Yes, sir!",spongebob,1
...,spongebob,1
"Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one.",not spongebob,0
"No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you.",spongebob,1
I've got two thumbs-up!,spongebob,1
Oh. That's... thank you. I think.,not spongebob,0
Whoo!,spongebob,1
"Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up.",spongebob,1
This old thing? It's just something I threw on.,not spongebob,0
"Well, girl, you really make it work.",spongebob,1
Okay.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, I'm trying to find the Goo Lagoon and I'm totally lost.",not spongebob,0
Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions.,spongebob,1
Hm... that way? Okay.,not spongebob,0
"You got the right stuff, golden boys.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, don't you think that you may be using the thumbs-up just a teensy bit too much?",not spongebob,0
Are you kidding?,spongebob,1
"The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!",spongebob,1
"Yeah, I know. But when you do it all the time the thumbs-up loses its meaning. It becomes not special.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up.",spongebob,1
"I don't know, SpongeBob. I think you should be careful.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale.",spongebob,1
What could do wrong?,spongebob,1
"Ah.  Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today.",spongebob,1
"Hey, guy. Way to wait.",spongebob,1
"Who, me?",not spongebob,0
Yeah...,not spongebob,0
"Hey, guy. Way to walk.",spongebob,1
,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this feels great.",spongebob,1
Way to flick that eye booger--,spongebob,1
Thumbhawk one. Thumbhawk one. This is Thumbhawk two. We got two thumbs down. Repeat. Two thumbs down!,not spongebob,0
"Thumbhawk one here, copy that. Initiate emergency procedures.",not spongebob,0
"Initiating on my count. Three, two, one.",not spongebob,0
My thumbs. My thumbs! My thumbs!,spongebob,1
"How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?",spongebob,1
"Well, I'm afraid it doesn't look good, SpongeBob. It seems you've severely damaged your ulnar collateral ligament, possible from some kind of repeated action.",not spongebob,0
An action like a thumbs-up?,spongebob,1
Certainly that is one possibility. Hitchhiking could be another.,not spongebob,0
"But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I can't say that for certain. I'm only a board certified thumbologist. I don't know everything. I can only say that we must give it time and see. There are limits to science. But you should prepare yourself for the possibility that you may never regain the use of your thumbs again.",not spongebob,0
"All right, you boneless invertebrate lazy bones...  Come on. Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days.",not spongebob,0
"Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Uh, let me give you a hand. My thumbs work.",not spongebob,0
No! I can do it.,spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, son, but I have a business to run. I'm gonna have to let you go.",not spongebob,0
"That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I understand.",spongebob,1
Now where's me new fry cook?,not spongebob,0
There he is. Come on in here.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?",spongebob,1
"Uh, yeah, I guess. I probably won't even be able to do good flipping.",not spongebob,0
"With a little practice, you could do anything.   Oh...",spongebob,1
"OI' Patty flippin' patties. Who'd a' thunk it, huh?",spongebob,1
Poor kid.,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob! It's me, Sandy!  Hey SpongeBob! I haven't seen you in days, whatcha doin'?",not spongebob,0
Waiting for autumn.,spongebob,1
"Come now, it can't be that bad!",not spongebob,0
"Leave me Sandra, forget you ever knew me! Erase from your memory the face of this useless sponge! With these......mutilated thumbs!",spongebob,1
Don't give up SpongeBob! You have to find something you love! Something to live for!,not spongebob,0
And what might that be?,spongebob,1
I don't know SpongeBob! That's a question you have to answer for yourself.,not spongebob,0
Sandy? Sandy! Sandy come back!  I need you to help me open this jar of peanut butter!  Enough sitting around feeling sorry for myself!,spongebob,1
"Uhhhhhh, turn over.",not spongebob,0
My thumbs are better and I am ready to work!,spongebob,1
The job's taken.,not spongebob,0
Well I'm taking it back.,spongebob,1
Just how are you gonna do that?,not spongebob,0
Thumb war.,spongebob,1
En garde!,not spongebob,0
"One, two, three, four. I declare a thumb war!",not spongebob,0
Admit it! You have been bested!,not spongebob,0
Never!,spongebob,1
Then prepare to be pinned!,not spongebob,0
Don't give up! Something to live for!,not spongebob,0
Something to live for!,not spongebob,0
Woooaaahh!,not spongebob,0
Yeeeaaahh!,spongebob,1
SpongeBob wins!,not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, you old patty junkie! Welcome home son!",not spongebob,0
"It's okay, I hate work anyway.",not spongebob,0
Oh Patrick!,spongebob,1
"No really, I do hate work!  Everybody's laughing! Oh hey SpongeBob, I got something for ya!",not spongebob,0
Yes Patrick?,spongebob,1
"It's time for another SpongeBob SquarePants special! But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was…  …one hundred million years ago! So prepare yourself for…  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  With your host, Patchy the Pirate!",not spongebob,0
"Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave? good question, you little...  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  ...back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now!  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures!  Your clothes always match!  You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya!  It was much easier to hit a baseball!  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids! Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is! Please welcome the Potty-dactyl!",not spongebob,0
Sorry I'm late.,not spongebob,0
Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!,not spongebob,0
"You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.",not spongebob,0
"What?!  That's not true! Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.",not spongebob,0
No he doesn't.,not spongebob,0
Yes he does.,not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
He most certainly does.,not spongebob,0
No he doesn't.,not spongebob,0
Yes he does!,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
I know for a fact that he does!,not spongebob,0
...not.,not spongebob,0
Meanwhile.,not spongebob,0

"I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with  two sticks?  Yeah… Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy!  Rubbing…  I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn.  Potty!",not spongebob,0

It's OK, Cavey.",not spongebob,0

Potty!! You're ruining me caveman show!,not spongebob,0
Attack!!!!! Attack!!!!!!!!,not spongebob,0
Will Patchy ever get control of the special?  What will SpongeBob do with fire?  Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out!,not spongebob,0
Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch!,not spongebob,0
This is great.,not spongebob,0

Bikini Bottom Triangle?,spongebob,1

Remember to drink plenty of fluids.,not spongebob,0
"Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song. The mermaids' song triggers this here contrapteron, to suck the sky like a vacuum, dumpin' all the contents here on this island.

Patrick!,spongebob,1
Have you found my cuff links?,not spongebob,0

"Like, this is the Bikini Bottom Triangle. Nothing ever leaves. Duh.",not spongebob,0
"Uhh, are you sure?",spongebob,1
"Look, little freakazoid, we only know one thing, and that's how to surround ourself with cool new stuff whenever we feel like it, anything beyond that is T.N.O.P.",not spongebob,0

He looks fine to me.,not spongebob,0
"What's the matter, boy-o?  Your Krabby Patty meter's on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or-  Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one-  ...Krabby Patty.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten.",spongebob,1
"Why, thank you, boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?",not spongebob,0
"Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there er... there is no way out.",spongebob,1
"Oh, really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, sir, I-",spongebob,1
"Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm will have 'em telling us exactly how to get out of this place.  So there's really no way out of this place?

No way!,not spongebob,0
We want to go to the mall!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, do you?",not spongebob,0
Uh-huh!,not spongebob,0
"Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.",not spongebob,0
"That's it, sir! It's the mermaids!",spongebob,1
It sure is- what?,not spongebob,0
The reverse switch is the mermaids! They just need to sing their song backwards.,spongebob,1
Yeah! Backwards!,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, backwards. What a stupid idea that-",not spongebob,0

Ouch.,not spongebob,0
Why would you play cards with him?,spongebob,1
"Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!",not spongebob,0
"Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1

"But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab!",spongebob,1
"I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!",not spongebob,0
"What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs!,spongebob,1
"This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For fifteen years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs!",not spongebob,0

"What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.",not spongebob,0

Hi!,not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!",spongebob,1
"Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.",not spongebob,0
Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.,spongebob,1
Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I usually cook on a grill.",spongebob,1
"You got it!  Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.",spongebob,1
"Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?",not spongebob,0
A little more to the left.,spongebob,1
"How's this, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Move it over a little more.,spongebob,1
Here?,not spongebob,0

So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?,not spongebob,0

Faster! Faster! Faster!,spongebob,1
"And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?",not spongebob,0
All this preparation is making me hungry.,spongebob,1
Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?,not spongebob,0
Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.,spongebob,1
"Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?",not spongebob,0

I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.,not spongebob,0

The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!,not spongebob,0
Yay!,not spongebob,0
"But, let me give you two a warning.  This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off.  So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job.",not spongebob,0
Patrick?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?,spongebob,1
"No way, SpongeBob. We're not getting paid to move stuff.",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.",spongebob,1
"Well, that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.",spongebob,1
"Good, just don't pay me.",not spongebob,0
"First, we need to set up the tarp.",spongebob,1
Tarp ahoy!,not spongebob,0
"We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about!  Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.",spongebob,1
That will never ever come off.,not spongebob,0
"And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.",spongebob,1
"And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the lid's already off.",spongebob,1
Oh...  now it's my turn!,not spongebob,0
"I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Well, that was a rip-off.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go...",spongebob,1
One hour later.,not spongebob,0
...Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall!,spongebob,1
Two hours later.,not spongebob,0
...I'm getting to the painting...,spongebob,1
Three hours later.,not spongebob,0
Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.,not spongebob,0
No problem. Here I go.  Yeah. Huh?  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?,spongebob,1
"Oh, I know...  TWO giant paint bubbles!",not spongebob,0
Noooooo!!  Patrick?,spongebob,1
"Yeah, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I don't think this bubble can get much bigger.,spongebob,1
Nonsense!,not spongebob,0
"Pat, no!!  We did it!  We painted the whole house! And without getting a drop of paint on anything but th--  FLAPPIN' FLOTSAM, WHAT'S THAT!?!?!?!?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?",spongebob,1
Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!,not spongebob,0
That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!,spongebob,1
"I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.",not spongebob,0
"Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.",spongebob,1
"Oh, now I see it!",not spongebob,0
"This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon! And when he sees what we did to his first dollar…",spongebob,1
AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!,not spongebob,0
"Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!",not spongebob,0
But Mr. Krabs said...,spongebob,1
Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!,not spongebob,0
Did it work?,spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Did it work?,spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
Did it work?,spongebob,1
Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!,not spongebob,0
Nothing's working!,spongebob,1
"Wait, SpongeBob, we're not cavemen!  We have technology!",not spongebob,0
It didn't work.,spongebob,1
"This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...",not spongebob,0
"Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.",spongebob,1
"I don't see where you're going with this...  Hey, a dollar!",not spongebob,0
"Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick!! No!  PATRICK, NO! WHY DID YOU PUT IT...  AHH! GRAB IT, PAT, GRAB IT! HURRY, HURRY! I...  Aww, Pat, no, no!  GET IT, PAT! GET IT! GET IT, GET IT!  No-o-o-o-oh!",spongebob,1
...Wanna bite?,not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!",spongebob,1
"You're on your own, pal.",not spongebob,0
"Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!",spongebob,1
What the…?,not spongebob,0
"We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you.",not spongebob,0
"You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...",spongebob,1
Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!",not spongebob,0
Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?,not spongebob,0
"It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!",spongebob,1
We didn't do it on purpose!,not spongebob,0
Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!,not spongebob,0
I don't want to be butt-less!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar!...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this doll-a-rama were perfectly aligned!",not spongebob,0
Mama.,not spongebob,0
"And you boys thought I wouldn't notice! Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what are you doing?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, you know, just hanging around.",spongebob,1
Boooooooooooo.,not spongebob,0
"Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.",not spongebob,0
"No, No, Mr. Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!",spongebob,1
Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?,not spongebob,0
"We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
We're so sorry!,not spongebob,0
And then did you draw on it with crayon?!,not spongebob,0
"I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it?",not spongebob,0
"All right, boys! You know what I've got to do now?",not spongebob,0
You mean our butts?,spongebob,1
Can I use mine one last time?,not spongebob,0
"There we go, good as new.",not spongebob,0
"But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!",spongebob,1
"Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Bikini Bottom! It's a very special day today because we have got the new single from Boys Who Cry: 'It's All About You'.",not spongebob,0

"You have no idea what day tomorrow is, do you?",not spongebob,0
None at all.,not spongebob,0
It's my 16th birthday!,not spongebob,0
"I knew that! How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?",not spongebob,0
"I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.",not spongebob,0
"Well, we don't want that to happen.",not spongebob,0
"Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap!  Hi, girls.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors?",not spongebob,0
Remember the time we all had to share one balloon?  Please.,not spongebob,0
Remember the pony ride?,not spongebob,0
I can't wait to see how he ruins this year.,not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
"Uh-oh. Everybody, brace for impact!",not spongebob,0
Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.,not spongebob,0
"Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors, bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast.",not spongebob,0
"Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties, but you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap!",not spongebob,0
I promise.,not spongebob,0
"Good, because I made a list.  Now I want everything on this list at my party.  Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.",not spongebob,0
"What's this, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.,not spongebob,0
I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?,spongebob,1
Exactly.,not spongebob,0
Wow.,spongebob,1
"Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.",not spongebob,0
Detective work. I'm going undercover.,spongebob,1
"So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Angela likes Brad.,spongebob,1
"Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.",not spongebob,0
I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic.,spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs, huh? Quick, how do you spell Krabs?",not spongebob,0
Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.,spongebob,1
"Close enough.  There you go, kid.",not spongebob,0
"That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.",spongebob,1
"Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.",spongebob,1
"Pearl, you have got to see this.",not spongebob,0
"Coming, Judy.",not spongebob,0
Oh...hmmm...,not spongebob,0
Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.,spongebob,1
This is the greatest thing in the whole world!,not spongebob,0
"The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.,not spongebob,0
"I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony?  Whee!,not spongebob,0
"Pearl, come here. This is so coral.",not spongebob,0
"Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.",not spongebob,0
"Hi, Billy!",not spongebob,0
Meep.,not spongebob,0
Isn't he dreamy?,spongebob,1
Price check on 4.,not spongebob,0
Meep.,not spongebob,0
"I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece.",not spongebob,0
Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.,not spongebob,0
Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.",not spongebob,0
"Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.",not spongebob,0
"You're a real fan, huh?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, yeah, I know all their songs.",not spongebob,0
All their songs?,not spongebob,0
Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?,not spongebob,0
"It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not.",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.",not spongebob,0
It's almost time for the party to start!,not spongebob,0
"I'm back, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?",not spongebob,0
The delivery truck will be here momentarily.,spongebob,1
"Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.",not spongebob,0
"Everybody, get into position.",not spongebob,0
Happy birthday!,not spongebob,0
It's a boy?!,not spongebob,0
Daddy!,not spongebob,0
Stale popcorn.  It tastes like dishwater.,not spongebob,0
It is dishwater.,not spongebob,0
Is that supposed to be me?  It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross!,not spongebob,0
Who wants cake?,not spongebob,0
"Well, the cake does look good.  It's made out of cardboard!",not spongebob,0
And frosting.,not spongebob,0
"Well, Pearl, sixteen lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.",not spongebob,0
"Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, even better, sweetie. Hit it.",not spongebob,0
"Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.",not spongebob,0
Yeah!,not spongebob,0
Boo!,not spongebob,0
What a rip-off!,not spongebob,0
This stinks!,not spongebob,0
"Daddy, how could you? I... gave... you... a list!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, come back!",not spongebob,0
"You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me.",not spongebob,0
"I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.",not spongebob,0
That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go!,spongebob,1
You bought me a boat?,not spongebob,0
I did? I mean...I did?!,not spongebob,0
Wow.,not spongebob,0
"Oh daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.",not spongebob,0
"Just watch.  Hit it, boys!",spongebob,1
Boys Who Cry It's All About You,not spongebob,0
"Boy, how much is all this costing me?",not spongebob,0
Here's the receipt.,spongebob,1
I ought to...,not spongebob,0
"Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.",not spongebob,0
"You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Don't push your luck, boy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.",not spongebob,0
"No problem, Pearl. You still going for that party tonight?",not spongebob,0
Oh-ho! You bet!,not spongebob,0
Nautical.  I'll pick ya up at eight.,not spongebob,0
"Again? Come on, Pearly-girl, we're running low on doors here!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited about going to the big party tonight!  I—I—I just had to...",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sweetie.  Daddy's going out to play cards with the boys tonight.",not spongebob,0
"But, but Daddy!",not spongebob,0
"No buts! I can't be worrying about you all night, honey.",not spongebob,0
"But, Daddy, I just want to go to the party!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, shrimp.",not spongebob,0
Whoa!,not spongebob,0
"Whew.  Hmm?  Ahh!  There, there, me little beluga. It'll be okay. I hired Mr. Squidward to babysit just like when you were little.",not spongebob,0
"Ew, Dad! Squidward is so lame.",not spongebob,0
"Lame, schmame. You and Squidward will have so much fun, you won't want to go anywhere. But just in case.  You won't be able to go anywhere!  Oh, just in time.",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Thanks for keeping an eye on me little Pearl tonight.,not spongebob,0
No problem.,not spongebob,0
"Remember our deal, Squidward. Keep Pearl out of trouble and I'll give you one shift a week without SpongeBob. But if anything happens to my little angel, I won’t give any shifts without SpongeBob...",not spongebob,0
"No! Please! Anything but that! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.  You can count on me.",not spongebob,0
I knew I could.,not spongebob,0
Whew!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thanks for watching the house tonight, Squidward. I'll be back late. So, you know, don't wait up for  me!",not spongebob,0
Your dad said we have to stay in tonight!  But that doesn't mean we can't have  fun!,not spongebob,0
Look.  We can play with this setaceous Sally doll.  Or we could color this princess coloring book.  Or we could sing along with—Ahh!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, Sally!",not spongebob,0
Outside the lines!,not spongebob,0
"Pearl?  Hello?  Hmm, hey, uh, Pearl. Um, whatcha' up to?",not spongebob,0
Arts and crafts!,not spongebob,0
"Hey, I dabble in the arts myself. Maybe I can help.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, never mind. Uh, you seem to have that under control. I'll just, um, be out here if you need me. Or not. Definitely not.  That is one morbid teen.",not spongebob,0
That outta keep him out of my hair.,not spongebob,0
It's go-time!,not spongebob,0
"Oh.  What's happening?  Pearl? Oh. You asleep? Aw, she must've tuckered herself out.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, no! Maybe if we get it on ice, then can reattach it— Ahh!",not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.",not spongebob,0
No prob.,not spongebob,0
She's gone! Krabs is gonna kill me!,not spongebob,0
"Um, that sign said surface. Are you sure this is the way?",not spongebob,0
"For sure, babe. We're going to a breach party.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, I've never been to one of those before. Sounds exciting.",not spongebob,0
Whoo!,not spongebob,0
"Hmm. Mm-hmm.  Hmm. Still warm.  The surface, eh? That SpongeBob-free shift will be mine!  SpongeBob-shift— mine!",not spongebob,0
"Mmm! Oh-ho, Dylan.",not spongebob,0
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!,not spongebob,0
Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach!,not spongebob,0
Whoo-hoo!,not spongebob,0

You have to come home right away! We can do whatever you want if we go back now! I'll even play us some jazz!  Kids love jazz!,not spongebob,0
"♪Come on, Pearl. Let's go home. I can't be here all alone.  Let's get back, before we're dead.  Skiddle-bobba-doo-diddle-bop-bop, yeah!♪",not spongebob,0
No! Jazz making me nerdier!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is so embarrassing!",not spongebob,0
"Forget him, Pearl. Let's breach.",not spongebob,0
Yeah!  Yeah! Yes! Yeah!,not spongebob,0
"Uh, I don't know. Is it dangerous?",not spongebob,0
"Uh-uh, babe. It's nautical.",not spongebob,0
Pearl! What about yo-yos? Kids love yo-yos!,not spongebob,0
"Okay, let's do it! One, two, three,  yahoo! This is so coral!  Dylan, help! This isn't nautical!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, man! She's beached!",not spongebob,0
We're gonna be in so much trouble!,not spongebob,0
Leave her! Let's cheese it!,not spongebob,0
Let's get out of here!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no!",not spongebob,0
"Pearl, are you alright?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.",not spongebob,0
It's okay! Let's just get you outta' here.,not spongebob,0
"Okay, okay, just hold on a second!",not spongebob,0
Hold on? What are you—Ahh!,not spongebob,0
Huh?,not spongebob,0
I can't believe Dylan ditched me! My life is over!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I don't think it's that bad.",not spongebob,0
"I'll, um, just get you home.",not spongebob,0
"Many, many minutes later...",not spongebob,0
Guess I'll just wait for my dad to get home.,not spongebob,0
"You know, there is a way we can still have a little fun tonight.",not spongebob,0
Really?,not spongebob,0
"Like, hello?",not spongebob,0
"Good morning, Gary!  Good morning, Mr. Mailman!",spongebob,1
"Morning, SpongeBob. Ah, it is a good morning, isn't it.  Ah!",not spongebob,0
"Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends...",spongebob,1
"Ah, stay away!  Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.",not spongebob,0
The best job...,spongebob,1
He's already ten seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this.,not spongebob,0
"And, of course, the bestest pet.",spongebob,1
Meow.  Meow!,not spongebob,0
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!,spongebob,1
"Hi, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick! How goes it?",spongebob,1
"Well, it was great until you showed up.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,spongebob,1
"Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. Idiot Boy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company.",spongebob,1
Squidward!,spongebob,1
Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy.,not spongebob,0
It's all done! My greatest invention yet!,not spongebob,0
Sandy! What a neat robot!,spongebob,1
No!,not spongebob,0
"Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.",spongebob,1
"Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got!  Get out of here! Idiot Boy!",not spongebob,0
"I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not!  SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.",not spongebob,0
"No worries, captain!  Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up...",spongebob,1
"Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar.  What the barnacles is going on?",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you okay?",spongebob,1
"I'm fine, as long as me money's okay.",not spongebob,0
"Although we've only known each other a short time, I want you to know... I love you.",not spongebob,0
"If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy!",not spongebob,0
"I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me Idiot Boy, it must be true, I know what must be done!  I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gare?",spongebob,1
"I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you.  Goodbye, pineapple.  Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it.  Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538.  Minus 1.  Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy...  Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump!",spongebob,1
"Patrick, where's SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake.,not spongebob,0
We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah!,not spongebob,0
Mrloooow.,not spongebob,0
"Gary? Where are you, little guy?",not spongebob,0
Mrloooow.,not spongebob,0
Gary? Gary?,not spongebob,0
Mrloow.,not spongebob,0
Gary! What happened to you?,not spongebob,0
Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow.,not spongebob,0
"A note.  To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy.",not spongebob,0
I could use this.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, I like these here.",not spongebob,0
This is top quality.,not spongebob,0
Hello there.  What's going on?,spongebob,1
"Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Are you talking to me?,spongebob,1
Isn't this your name?,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, is it?",spongebob,1
You don't know your name?,not spongebob,0
All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything.,spongebob,1
"Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!",not spongebob,0
"CheeseHead, huh?  Wait a minute, what's this?",spongebob,1
Bubbles?!,not spongebob,0
I wonder what got into them?,not spongebob,0
We interrupt this program for an important announcement.  Bikini Bottom is literally in a state of total chaos tonight.,not spongebob,0
Literally!,not spongebob,0
We go now to news scene chopper 7. What's up?,not spongebob,0
"Not looking too good out here, Perch. The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the hinges. Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties.",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!",not spongebob,0
"If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?",not spongebob,0
"Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...",not spongebob,0
Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
I think we just went through this...,not spongebob,0
"What he means to say is, no, we haven't.",not spongebob,0
"Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back.",not spongebob,0
"Let me see that.  To whom that may concern, ... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?!",not spongebob,0
What am I gonna do without my best friend?! I should never have been mean to you!,not spongebob,0
I should have never kicked you out of my house!,not spongebob,0
If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob--  I would have slammed the door in his face even harder!,not spongebob,0
"All right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!  Now...  how do you propose we find me money-making employee?",not spongebob,0
"Whoo, I live in a dump!",not spongebob,0
"Hey, watch where your stepping!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, sir, I was just-",not spongebob,0
"I know what you was doing. You was doing the old bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!",not spongebob,0
"I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I lead.  Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty.  Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere.  Help wanted?",not spongebob,0
"Well, Mr... BrownPants... you seem to have left this entire application blank.",not spongebob,0
I can't remember a thing.,not spongebob,0
"Well, do you have any special skills?",not spongebob,0
"Special skills... oh, I can do this!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, what do you think you're doing?!  Sorry, sir, but we run a respectable business here!",not spongebob,0
"Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand.  Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.",not spongebob,0
"That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding.",not spongebob,0
Then this might be music to your ears.,not spongebob,0
"Neptune's son, what are you doing?  You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired!",not spongebob,0
"I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me.  Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me?",not spongebob,0
"Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
You do?,not spongebob,0
"Yup, and it involves this.  It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.",not spongebob,0
"So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find--",not spongebob,0
"Oops, I dropped it.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Squidward! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape! And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.,not spongebob,0
"If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.",not spongebob,0
Ha! Is that your version of a threat?,not spongebob,0
"Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.",not spongebob,0
"Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any–  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!",not spongebob,0
Not so fast! Bring back me number one fry cook first.,not spongebob,0
"Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?",not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game.",not spongebob,0
I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat.  You guys mind if I bubble?,not spongebob,0
You can't do that here!,not spongebob,0
But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch.  See? Feeling better already.,not spongebob,0
Do you have any...  I think we've made our point with the snapping!  As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are?,not spongebob,0
"Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...",not spongebob,0
"Don't answer.  I'll show ya.  We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article one of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf.  You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city?! Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys!",not spongebob,0
Where'd he go?  After him!,not spongebob,0
"Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort.",not spongebob,0
You- you did it!  Do you realize what you've done?,not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0
"You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town!",not spongebob,0
"Thank you, CheeseBoy!",not spongebob,0
What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us.,not spongebob,0
"Actually, it's CheeseHead.",not spongebob,0
"Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets.  Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you...  mayor of New Kelp City!",not spongebob,0
All hail mayor CheeseHead!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
Buddy? You there?,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!  Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"There he is, guys!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.",not spongebob,0
"That's not SpongeBob, Patrick.  here's SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.",not spongebob,0
Oh.,not spongebob,0
Now let's see what that little critter's up to.  New mayor of...  SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!,not spongebob,0
"Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a leader. I'm not exactly sure what a mayor…is. But I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat, it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of New Kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.",not spongebob,0
CheeseHead BrownPants?,not spongebob,0
New Kelp City has brown-pants mania.,not spongebob,0
"Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here, but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, this is a surprise.",not spongebob,0
Surprised I found you?,not spongebob,0
"No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.",not spongebob,0
"It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel.",not spongebob,0
"You may not remember the weasel, but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?",not spongebob,0
"I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.",not spongebob,0
You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.,not spongebob,0
"Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact, I'm late for a meeting.",not spongebob,0
"SpongeBob, wait!",not spongebob,0
"Don't just stand there, get in.",not spongebob,0
Squidward?,not spongebob,0
"Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here I come.",not spongebob,0
Here it is! You must recognize this place.,not spongebob,0
Nope.,not spongebob,0
"Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.",not spongebob,0
I was a fry cook before?,not spongebob,0
"Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.",not spongebob,0
"Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers, I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city.",not spongebob,0
"Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!  Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook. You gotta pay up.",not spongebob,0
"All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.",not spongebob,0
Ohh! It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  NOOOOOO!,not spongebob,0
"You okay, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sandy-  Hey, I remember this place!",spongebob,1
SpongeBob's back!,not spongebob,0
"We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.",not spongebob,0
"I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Goodbye, everyone.",spongebob,1
"What? / Huh? / Oh, not again.",not spongebob,0
"He's leaving, again!",not spongebob,0
Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door.  This is a KNKC special report. Panic in the streets of New Kelp City as rampant bubbles bring visibility down to 0. The angry citizens here blame the apocalyptic scene on Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants and his newly-enacted bubble policy.,not spongebob,0
"If I ever see Mayor Brown Pants again I'm gonna grab his little, yellow head and literally rip his!--",not spongebob,0
Where's SpongeBob?,not spongebob,0
Order up!  Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friends?,spongebob,1
"Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty!  SpongeBob, another masterpiece.",not spongebob,0
"It's great to have you back, Spongy.",not spongebob,0
Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.,spongebob,1
"Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?",spongebob,1
A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left. Ha- Perfect!  Oww.,not spongebob,0
"Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!",spongebob,1
"No, he doesn't!",not spongebob,0
But just look at him go!,spongebob,1
"This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.",not spongebob,0
"Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.",spongebob,1
"Nope, Squidward's right. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators! I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it.",not spongebob,0
Thanks Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Sure thing, Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day!",not spongebob,0
"♪Oh, I wonder wonder wonder how many Patties must be made♪",not spongebob,0
"Wonder no longer, you only need one.",not spongebob,0
"♪rednow rednow rednow I, ho. edam eb tsum seittap♪  What do you mean one?!",not spongebob,0
Didn't you see today's newspaper?,not spongebob,0
No takers for 'McNulty Challenge'. Ha! What's that suppose to mean?,not spongebob,0
He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.,not spongebob,0
"I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet.",not spongebob,0
Hey at least we have Founders Day!,spongebob,1
"I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.",not spongebob,0
"I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties, please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry.  Squidward did you get a new haircut?",not spongebob,0
"Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!",not spongebob,0
I isn't Patrick?,not spongebob,0
"No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.",not spongebob,0
I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.,not spongebob,0
"I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he.",not spongebob,0
"You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!",not spongebob,0
"Ah! Oh no, that's gonna hurt!",not spongebob,0
"Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.",not spongebob,0
I like to eat!,not spongebob,0
Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.,not spongebob,0
"Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.",not spongebob,0
Tummies! Ha-ha-ha,spongebob,1
I like whistles!,not spongebob,0
Eat!,not spongebob,0
What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!,not spongebob,0
Gotta warm up my taste buds first.,not spongebob,0
"Son, can you eat faster?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, faster?",not spongebob,0
Four and a half patties in one minute! Well McNulty can eat a hundred in a minute! But you know I think your teeth might be getting in the way a little bit-,not spongebob,0
"Oh, why didn't you say so.",not spongebob,0
"Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.",not spongebob,0
I don't,not spongebob,0
"Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film.",not spongebob,0
"Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!",not spongebob,0
His homework?,not spongebob,0
Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.,not spongebob,0
His taxes?,spongebob,1
"Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys,  That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on  You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!",not spongebob,0
I don't get to taste?,not spongebob,0
This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.,spongebob,1
"Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need a hundred more patties.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, i'll get right on it.",spongebob,1
"We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting.",not spongebob,0
There he goes!,not spongebob,0
Our champion!,not spongebob,0
He's so dreamy!,not spongebob,0
"Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!",not spongebob,0
"Say, can my little boy ask you something?",not spongebob,0
Are you the brave man that's gonna bring the belt back to Bikini Bottom?,not spongebob,0
Inspiring words!,not spongebob,0
I hurted my foot on the playground.,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends!",not spongebob,0
"Dad, is that the bad man who took the belt away from Bikini Bottom?",not spongebob,0
Yes it is son.,not spongebob,0
"Looks like this crowd is hungry! For excitement that is, and also possibly food, any moment now these doors will open on what promises to be the most dynamic patty eating contest, in Founders Day history.",not spongebob,0
"Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!",not spongebob,0
"Today, our local hero, Patrick Star, the courageous underdog, is going against five time belt winner, Oswald McNulty from three towns over, one can only imagine the seeding tension pulling over right now, between these two titans of the sport, as they prepare for ultimate battle.",not spongebob,0
Hey.,not spongebob,0
How's it going.,not spongebob,0
Five short minutes to consume as many patties as they can.,not spongebob,0
Who's ready!,spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.",not spongebob,0
"Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.",spongebob,1
"I smell mutiny, what's going on here?",not spongebob,0
I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no problem,  here.",not spongebob,0
What's that?,not spongebob,0
"That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training.",not spongebob,0
But I didn't know I had to pay!,not spongebob,0
"Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son.",not spongebob,0
"Ow, my foot.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.",not spongebob,0
You made the right choice kid!,not spongebob,0
"There's the bell! And we're off and eating.  McNulty taking an early lead and really going to work with those patties, what a dynamo! A little skull from three towns over eating at a terrific pace! But what's this?  Patrick Star isn't moving, he seems stuck in the gate!",not spongebob,0
What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!,not spongebob,0
"McNulty is pressing forward, looks like this is gonna be a blowout!",not spongebob,0
"Patrick,  I believe in you Patrick.",not spongebob,0
"But wait! Patrick Star is on the move, patties are starting to disappear, look at that little sea star eat! He's inching closer to McNulty, and it look like McNulty can feel the heat, never have there been a more pretentious display of competitive eating! The amount of patties being consumed is astounding.  And now, yes, yes! Patrick Star has matched Oswald McNulty! And they are tied as they come into the home stretch! Both eaters are so full they could barely eat but eat they do, moving so slowly now. One can't help but wonder if they are going to hit the patty wall at some point. And, and,  Both eaters have stopped! With only seconds left, we are tied in patties eaten, and neither one seems to have the room to go on! Oh! What is this?  And down goes McNulty, down goes McNulty!  It looks like we do have a tie!",not spongebob,0
"It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.",not spongebob,0
"The taste, Patrick,  Remember the taste!",spongebob,1
The taste.,not spongebob,0
"What's this? Patrick Star has risen from his seat, and is pointing to center field,  No wait! He's pointing to a little boy with a hurt foot.  Ladies and gentleman, he's pointing to his mouth, as if to indicate something.",not spongebob,0
"Here you go champ, you can have one.",not spongebob,0
"And, he's eating! He's eating! The Great Starbino, is eating!  Patrick Star wins! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom!",not spongebob,0
"Here you go son, you earned it fat and square.",not spongebob,0
"Congratulations, Starbino. So, are you gonna defend the belt next year?",not spongebob,0
"No, this thing doesn't even fit!",not spongebob,0
Ow! My other foot.,not spongebob,0
Your turn.,spongebob,1
Now you.,not spongebob,0
"Hey, Patrick.",spongebob,1
"Yes, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with...  two sticks?,spongebob,1
"Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!",not spongebob,0
"I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing Stick in a Cup.",spongebob,1
Are you tired of playing with an old stick and a cup?,not spongebob,0
Yeah.,not spongebob,0
"Well, say goodbye to boring and hello to whirly brains! The exciting new toy that puts you in the driver's seat of your own mind! It's so simple! Just flip your lid, attach the propeller, and watch your brain soar hundreds of feet into the air as you control the action!",not spongebob,0

Sandy!,not spongebob,0
Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things.",spongebob,1
And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds.  Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.,not spongebob,0
"Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?",not spongebob,0

"Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!",not spongebob,0
"Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!",not spongebob,0

"Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?",spongebob,1
I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.,not spongebob,0
Patrick?,spongebob,1
My think is clogged.,not spongebob,0
Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today.",spongebob,1

For me? Thanks!,spongebob,1
"Oh, it's not a gift, it's an ankle alarm! And the next time you try to sneak into the animal enclosures, it's gonna do this!",not spongebob,0

And stay out!,not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's it now. Let it all out.",not spongebob,0
I-I just want to pet the critters. Does that make me an animal?,spongebob,1
That mean old zookeeper!  He even looks like a monkey and he smells like one too!  You should just make your own zoo.,not spongebob,0
My own zoo? That's a laugh.  Ooh...  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?,spongebob,1

Voilà! Our first zoo animals.,spongebob,1

I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!",spongebob,1
"Oh, sorry.",not spongebob,0
It's okay.  Why did you do that?,spongebob,1
"Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.",not spongebob,0
"Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.",spongebob,1
Then what is it?,not spongebob,0
It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.,spongebob,1
"A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind?",not spongebob,0

Who? What? Where? What? How?,not spongebob,0
"Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?",spongebob,1
Nope.,not spongebob,0
I'm wearing a wig.,spongebob,1
"Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?",not spongebob,0
Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?,spongebob,1
Umm...maybe.,not spongebob,0
"If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.",spongebob,1
I can't wait.,not spongebob,0
"Wig away!  Order up, Squidward.",spongebob,1
"Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob!,not spongebob,0
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
"What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?",not spongebob,0
"Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.",not spongebob,0
"Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.",spongebob,1
Happy?,not spongebob,0
"Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.",spongebob,1
I can imagine.,not spongebob,0
"Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.",spongebob,1
"Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.",not spongebob,0
"There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice?",not spongebob,0
"I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?",spongebob,1
Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0

Nice wig.,not spongebob,0
"Like to keep in style, huh?",not spongebob,0
You know it.,spongebob,1
"Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?",not spongebob,0
"Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.",spongebob,1
How 'bout a little off the top?,not spongebob,0
"Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.",not spongebob,0
"This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.",spongebob,1
"Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame.",not spongebob,0
"Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.",not spongebob,0
Fired?!,not spongebob,0
But why?,not spongebob,0
Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.,not spongebob,0
Ned!,not spongebob,0
"Good going, dude.",not spongebob,0
I can't help not having hair!,not spongebob,0
"When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that!",not spongebob,0
"We are selling records, not denture cream!  Either you come back with hair, or don't come back at all!",not spongebob,0
"Time to go home, boys.",not spongebob,0
"Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too.",spongebob,1
It's about as functional as your brain.,not spongebob,0
"Thank you, Squidward.",spongebob,1
That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!,not spongebob,0
I don't understand.,spongebob,1
Just look at yourself.,not spongebob,0
"Hello, handsome.  Sss.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before!",not spongebob,0
"Hmmm, I've never been tall before.",spongebob,1
That wig is infested with parasites!,not spongebob,0
That tickles!,spongebob,1
Can't you see how ridiculous you look?,not spongebob,0
I think that it looks cool.,spongebob,1
Hahahaha! You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer!,not spongebob,0
"For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.",spongebob,1
"Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work!",not spongebob,0
"But, Mr. Krabs...",spongebob,1
No buts!,not spongebob,0
So I can't have a wig or a butt?,spongebob,1
"No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt outta here!",not spongebob,0
I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard.  SpongeBob? Huh?,not spongebob,0
"Hi, Sandy. What do you think?",spongebob,1
We need to talk.,not spongebob,0
Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody.,spongebob,1
"Well, it does attract a lot of attention.",not spongebob,0
I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.,spongebob,1
"Neither can I, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it!",not spongebob,0
"Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.  and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me.",spongebob,1
"Hey buddy, do you mind?",not spongebob,0
Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie!,spongebob,1
"Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.",not spongebob,0
"Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!",not spongebob,0
"People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.",spongebob,1
That's a great idea! Let's start a riot.,not spongebob,0
I told you that movie was terrible.,not spongebob,0
"Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?",not spongebob,0
"I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.",spongebob,1
It's time to be strong.,not spongebob,0
"I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!",spongebob,1
"Hurry up, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again.",spongebob,1
"You did the right thing, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined!  Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.,not spongebob,0
"Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.",spongebob,1
"Oh, he's got your hair.",not spongebob,0
Thank you.,not spongebob,0
SpongeBob.,not spongebob,0
Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.,spongebob,1
Look at my new wig.,not spongebob,0
"Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.",spongebob,1
"Yeah, they were. But look...",not spongebob,0
"Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?",spongebob,1
"Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya!",not spongebob,0
I wish I had a wig.,spongebob,1
"Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it.",not spongebob,0
"Ah, Sandy Cheeks is going out of town and has asked SpongeBob and Patrick to do a little pet-sitting for her.",not spongebob,0
Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them?,not spongebob,0
Perhaps she should have asked someone else.,not spongebob,0
"Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.",spongebob,1
"No, that's Italian, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
"Okay boys, this here is Birdy's food. Feed him twice a day.",not spongebob,0
This whole sack?,spongebob,1
"No, just a cup's worth.  This here's my cricket.  He's saying hello to you. Ain't he cute?",not spongebob,0
"Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.",spongebob,1
And this here's Snakey.,not spongebob,0
What's that lump in its belly?,spongebob,1
"Well, that's his dinner.  Well, I guess that's it. I gotta go.  See you guys in a couple of days.",not spongebob,0
"Bye, Sandy!",not spongebob,0
Wait! You forgot about this pet!,spongebob,1
"Oh, that's only Wormy. He don't eat much.",not spongebob,0
"Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.",spongebob,1
"Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.",not spongebob,0
"Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998, 999, 1,000. Ready or not, here I come!",spongebob,1
You found me.,not spongebob,0
There you are!  He found us!,not spongebob,0
"Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.",not spongebob,0
"I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.",spongebob,1
"Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy.",not spongebob,0
"Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow.",spongebob,1
"Here I come, Wormy!",spongebob,1
"Me, too!  And then we're gonna play tag, and then we're gonna color, and then we're gonna build a house of cards!",not spongebob,0
"We're back, Wormy! Wormy, Wormy?",not spongebob,0
Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?,not spongebob,0
He's gotta be in here.  I think something bad happened to Wormy.,spongebob,1
He left his Best Friend ribbon behind!,not spongebob,0
What is that thing?!,not spongebob,0
"I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!",spongebob,1
Why does this keep happening to me?!,not spongebob,0
"Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door!  No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit!",spongebob,1
Now what? We're trapped in here with that... that... Best Friend Eater!,not spongebob,0
"Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  It’s eaten Patrick!  Patrick, you're alive!",spongebob,1
I am?,not spongebob,0
"Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!",spongebob,1
"Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.",not spongebob,0
"No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!",spongebob,1
It's for you!,not spongebob,0
It's working. It’s gonna answer it.,spongebob,1
Tartar sauce.,not spongebob,0
"You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net.",spongebob,1
SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!,not spongebob,0
"Hold on, Patrick!",spongebob,1
"I really don't taste that good, Monster.",not spongebob,0
"I'm coming, Patrick!  No, Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second.  Yeah!  We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now......heading straight for the Krusty Krab!  It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance.",spongebob,1
"Okay, hold still.",not spongebob,0
It's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs!,not spongebob,0
"Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!",spongebob,1
Say money.,not spongebob,0
Money!,not spongebob,0
"What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!",not spongebob,0
We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.,spongebob,1
Is it a paying customer?,not spongebob,0
"Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!",spongebob,1
Just like it ate Wormy!,not spongebob,0
"Um, Wormy?",not spongebob,0
Why? Why? He was so young.,spongebob,1
"We’ll never forget you, Wormy.",not spongebob,0
"Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster.  That's the monster?",not spongebob,0
"Pretty scary, huh?",not spongebob,0
A living nightmare!,spongebob,1
"I should have known.  Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.",not spongebob,0
Now just 'cause you swabs never seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.,not spongebob,0
We tried to warn them. I can't watch.,spongebob,1
Get a load of the scary monster.  Monster.,not spongebob,0
"Aww, it looks harmless...",not spongebob,0
It's kinda cute.,not spongebob,0
It reminds me of money!,not spongebob,0
Monster.,not spongebob,0
Squidward?,spongebob,1
Mr. Krabs?,not spongebob,0
"It ate them! And there it goes!  First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs!  That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll.",spongebob,1
"Aye-aye, captain.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity.",spongebob,1
Gotcha.,not spongebob,0
"Run, everybody, run!",spongebob,1
Monster on the loose!,not spongebob,0
Monster!,spongebob,1
"Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!",not spongebob,0
A monster?!,not spongebob,0
"Attention, attention! This just in!  A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom.",not spongebob,0
"We did it, Patrick! We saved the city!  Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.",spongebob,1
About the what?,not spongebob,0
"Shoot! Looks like a twister hit this place. Where is everybody?  Oh, hey there Wormy.  You weren't supposed to change till I got back. That oughta hold ya, little guy.  Howdy, SpongeBob.",not spongebob,0
Sandy caught the monster!,spongebob,1
"I didn't know I'd be missed so much. Golly, maybe I should go out of town more often.",not spongebob,0
Squidward!,not spongebob,0
What is your problem?,not spongebob,0
My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!,not spongebob,0
"Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?",not spongebob,0
Minding it for  which customer?,not spongebob,0
"I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!",not spongebob,0
SpongeBob's got that covered.,not spongebob,0
"Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking!",spongebob,1
That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!,not spongebob,0
"I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.",not spongebob,0
"Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!",not spongebob,0
"Already done, sir!",spongebob,1
"Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.",not spongebob,0
"Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!",spongebob,1
"Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep--",not spongebob,0
Done and dusted!,spongebob,1
"Nice working conditions, but, no thanks!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.",not spongebob,0
"Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, all out of polish.",not spongebob,0
"Well, I'm not!",spongebob,1
"Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.",not spongebob,0
"It doesn't matter what you want me to do, I won't do it!",not spongebob,0
"Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.",not spongebob,0
"Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?",spongebob,1
For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.,not spongebob,0
The Yeti Krab?,spongebob,1
"Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!",not spongebob,0
"Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge.",spongebob,1
"Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You will be eaten!",not spongebob,0
Squidward and I are as close as brothers!,spongebob,1
Ludicrous.,not spongebob,0
"You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...",not spongebob,0
Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!,spongebob,1
"Precisely. See ya, boys!",not spongebob,0
Whatever.,not spongebob,0
"Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!",spongebob,1
You sure it's not these you're smelling?,not spongebob,0
"If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!",spongebob,1
"Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!",not spongebob,0
"Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!",spongebob,1
"You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.",not spongebob,0
"You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay.",spongebob,1
Just then... By sheer coincidence...,not spongebob,0
"Let me out of here, you hairy brute! I can find my own food!",not spongebob,0
"Good day, sir. Are you Yeti to order?  Oh, Squidward!",spongebob,1
What? What? What? Wha... huh?,not spongebob,0
You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!,spongebob,1
"Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?",not spongebob,0
"Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!",spongebob,1
"Oh, yes I am.",not spongebob,0
"Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!",spongebob,1
I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?,not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!",spongebob,1
"Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob!",not spongebob,0
"Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded.",spongebob,1
"SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!",not spongebob,0
"Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant!",spongebob,1
"Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!",not spongebob,0
Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say!,spongebob,1
Guess I'm down to the comic section.,not spongebob,0
Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!,spongebob,1
"That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witless, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too!",not spongebob,0
T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs!,spongebob,1
"Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody!",not spongebob,0
"I'm back, fellas!",not spongebob,0
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.",not spongebob,0
"Uh, Squidward?",not spongebob,0
What?,not spongebob,0
We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!,not spongebob,0
"Guys, do you hear that?",spongebob,1
You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp?,not spongebob,0
"No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me.",spongebob,1
"Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idle? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!",not spongebob,0
No.,not spongebob,0

"Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing.",spongebob,1
And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem.,not spongebob,0
Huh? Did you hear that?,not spongebob,0
"What's wrong, Frank?",not spongebob,0
That song. It sounds just like Martha!,not spongebob,0
"Frank, how many times do I have to tell you? Martha's no good for you! She's just no good!",not spongebob,0
Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?,not spongebob,0
It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine.  Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!,spongebob,1
It must very challenging for you!,not spongebob,0

SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy.,not spongebob,0
Patrick won't share OUR toy.,spongebob,1
What you need is a mediator. Y'all best sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other.  So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now.,not spongebob,0
Water?!,spongebob,1
Oh boy.,not spongebob,0
That mediator lady made some good points.,spongebob,1

Yes.,not spongebob,0
"Well, you're in luck! You two seem so thrilled with the toy. I had an entire case of 'em made. They've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.",not spongebob,0
