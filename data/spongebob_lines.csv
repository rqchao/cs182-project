"Hold on, I'll check the textbook.  Ah, Your Mirror and You. Hmm, proper seat belt hygiene? No."
Hooray!
"Mrs. Puff! Oh, there you are.  I'll make it up to you, Mrs. Puff. I'll shine your shoes!  Dry your hair!  Oil your boat?"
I love cleaning!
That takes care of that.  Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.
"Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern.  The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster."
That box is haunted!  These stairs are haunted!  This trash is haunted.
Ahh! Ghost snail!
"Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie!"
"Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans."
"Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety.  What! Louie?  Well, that oughta keep you out of my HAIR!"
"Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside.  No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain!   And the bait: one can-o-patty."
"Gotcha!  I don't gotcha.  You got me.  Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh?  Huh, where'd Louie go?  Louie! Louie! Louie!"
"Louie! So this is where you've been hiding?  Nice snail, good Louie!  No, no..."
"No, not the Krusty Krab!"
Must... stop... lighthouse.
"Louie? Where's Louie?  Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning!  You were just protecting your cute little babies.  I guess I should call you Louise instead!"
"Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff.  These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse."
"Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!"
"See you next week, Mrs. Puff!"
Sir... Sir!
"Good morning, Mr. Krabs!"
Yae-yes!
Yup!
Of course!
"I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs."
"The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!"
Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.
"Whoa! Hello again, Mr. Krabs."
What can I do you for?
"A penny? Sure.  Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now."
"Well, I thought I did."
"Hmm, no."
Hmm-mm.
Nuh-uh.
"Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous."
"Well, I do have a tie pocket though.  No, not in there either."
"Well, I..."
"Hey, look, it's my brain!  Hey, where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Ugh!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here."
"What's the matter, Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?"
Nope.
"Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working."
Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
The sounds are coming from back here. What the?
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!"
Yay!
Just like me!
"Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?"
"But, but..."
"But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie.  Oh, well."
Squidward? You look beautiful!
My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag!
Mr. Krabs.
I would like to donate a penny.
If I only had one!
Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
"Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny."
"No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint."
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah, well, good night, Gary."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Affirmative, captain!"
Why wouldn't I?
"I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!"
"Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!"
"One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again."
I took him to see a hypnotist.
No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
What did I say?
He was a really good hypnotist.
Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
Hypnosis? No! Hold still now.
I don't think this is going to work.  This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work!
Gettin' there.
"Oh... shouldn't be too much longer.  Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like."
Okay.
"Pearl!  Pearl, what happened?"
"I mean, you're right. There's more."
Hmm... Water and... this soap?
"Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere.  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?"
More for me!
"No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing."
"Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?"
"Pearl?  Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever."
"Okay, I'm coming in!  Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano."
"I have no idea.  Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!"
"Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up.  Oops, I didn't mean it like that.  Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again."
Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
Hello?  Something there? Pearl?!  Mr. Krabs!
"Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?"
Soap press?
Leftover Krabby Patties?
"Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you..."
"Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?"
"Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!"
"Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea..."
"All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three.  And, ta-da. What do you think?"
We shall see shortly.
Shh. Trust me.
"You have a good time, carefree teens!"
Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
"I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise."
"Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted.  I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow."
"Okay! Okay!  Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday."
"No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them...  ...front of them looking...  ...at me  ...with their eyes!  Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!"
I never knew an audience can get so physical.  This changes everything.
"Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes."
"No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here.  Just pretend you're a student at his desk."
"Okay, here goes.  Boating safety is..."
"Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice."
Boating safe...
"Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?"
"So, without further ado...  Patrick?  Patrick, wake up.  What happened, Patrick?"
I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
Worse?
Okay.  Boating safety...  Boating safe...
"Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!"
Boating safe...
"Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick."
"What, a detention slip?"
Okay.  Boating safe...
Boating safety...
"Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working."
"Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything."
"Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license!"
"No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!"
That's still illegal. Give me the goggles!  It's not working.
"Eh! Ooh, they work."
Huh...?
"Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready!  I can do it.  Um...  Oh, no. Oh, no!"
"Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?"
"Okay.  Uh, my report...is on...  Heh! Must be last-minute jitters!  Patrick, where are those goggles?"
Thanks!
"Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ..."
Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because --
They're all staring!
I don't know how!
"Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do.  Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--"
--for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care.
"Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!"
"Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison."
"Oh, hooray! Prison!"
"You got it, Warden Krabs."
"Aye-aye, sir!"
"Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me."
"I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!"
"Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have?  Toothy.  Four Eyes.  Lefty.  Fats.  Fingers.  Einstein.  Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky."
"No problem, guys."
"More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles?"
"Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?"
"Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in."
"Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—"
"Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?"
"Thanks for your help, Gare!"
"Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories.  No!  Come on, you!  Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories.  Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?"
"Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special."
You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.
"Oh, perfect!  Ah, memories. Greasy memories."
"Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!"
"Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!"
"Oh, well, better get these precious memories home."
"♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪  Hey, Gary.  Oh. Safe and sound!  Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit."
"Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything."
Like the front yard!
Who is it?
How do I know it's you?
"Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?"
"Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning."
"Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy,  Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?!  You will be missed."
Hi!
Condemned? What does that mean?
Vacate? You mean I have to move?
Wait! Please don't condemn my house.
But isn't there anything we can do?
Throw them away?
I know.  I'm gonna miss them so much!
No. I'll be strong.
"That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!"
"Your pay, my good man."
"Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump!"
"Alright, nighty-night."
"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house."
"Ah, oh."
Wah!
"Just treasuring our time together, Squidward."
"No, it hurts too much!"
"Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!"
"Here you go, Patrick. Now we never have to be apart,  even when we're not together."
"Yeah, see you forever, Patrick.  Time for bed, Tiny Patrick."
"Good morning, Squidward."
"You sit right there, my hungry little sailor, while I whip you up some grub from the galley."
"Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot."
Huh?
"Stop!  Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm.  Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done.  Ah-yah."
"Brushy, brushy, brushy."
"Patrick, hi."
"So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here."
Good night.
"I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam."
Ah!
Ehh. Huh?
Huh?
Oh?
Ding!  Yah!
"Yes, Squidward, extra mayo, I heard you."
"Oh, hi, Patrick."
I don't remember us having a sleepover last night.
"Oh, hey, little guys. You're playing with each other. So cute."
Whew.
"Ah, ah."
Hey!
"Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives."
Poor little guys.
"Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea."
"You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick."
Ta-da! A tiny house for my tiny friend.
Ahh!
"Nice work, Patrick. Whoops!  Almost forgot.  You've got to have a Gare-Bear."
"Oh, yay!"
"Let's leave 'em alone, Patrick."
"This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick.  There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over."
"Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP!  Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close."
Thank you.
Let me help you carry this.
Oh—your unmentionables.
This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. I've got a visual on a cab. Can you get a make on who the passenger is? Over.
"Aw, he went inside! Patrick, wouldn't it be great to have another friend who could join our Junior Crime Breakers? Ooh, I gotta get a look at him!"
"No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man.  So, we gotta be sneaky."
Shh! He must've gone upstairs.
Eye have just the thing!  Ow!
Ow!  D'ow!  Ow!  Oof!  Ow.
"Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie."
Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood!
"Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit."
"But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—"
Mermaid Man! It's Man Ray! He's right inside Squidward's...place.  Too late. Man Ray must've gotten to them.
"Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week!  Patrick, do you know what this means?"
"Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of... Evil!"
"Patrick, is that..."
Ow!
"Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons?  So stale, yet so deadly."
♪Dum-dah-dah!♪
"Surrender, Man Ray!"
"Yeah, an evil holiday!"
Here's a dessert that's sure to hurt!
"All right, Man Ray. I will snare you in my clara-net!"
Evil never takes a vacation!
"Help yourself, Man Ray."
Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it.
Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers.  Huh?
"Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!"
"Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14.  We have super saliva!"
"Hello, Fred. Your leg! (28) Looks great."
"Oh, Fred, I'm so sorry I drove that freight train onto your leg! (30)"
"Heh, choo-choo..."
Flashbacks tickle.
"Ooh, I know. I'll protect his leg! (32) From harm, incognito."
"Ow, ow."
Yowch!
"This is his job?! Oh no. Not safe. Must think.  Welcome back, Fred. Nice leg (34) work. But you know, it's a lot safer if you use a... table leg (35) instead."
"Now Fred, I wouldn't pull your leg! (36) Watch this.  Huh?"
"Well, at least Fred's leg! (37) is safe."
"This is no time to be smelling stinks, Patrick. I need to protect Fred's leg! (39) And I can't do it alone."
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
All quiet on the right side.
"Sorry, ma'am."
"Mayday, Chicken Leg! (53) (41) We got a situation on the griddle!"
"Fred, you have to listen to me. Your leg! (55) (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?"
At least you know that your leg's! (58) (46) Perimeter is secured.
Why?
Ooh!
"Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt your leg! (59) (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?"
I'd say it's almost time for your break.
I should probably use something stronger.
Ahh?
Hmm.
"Trust me, Fred, your leg! (61) (49) Is as good as broken."
"And here comes the love train, right on schedule!"
"Mr. Robot, that is very rude. How are we supposed to break Fred's leg! (64) (52) Now?"
"Oh, is that all? Shucks, he can have my leg!  (67) (32) (55) It'll grow back.  Boink!  Enjoy."
"Now, don't put your tail between your legs! (69) (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do...  Heyyy! My leg! (70) (34) (58)"
"Oh, don't thank me, Fred. Your leg! (73) (60) Did all the heavy lifting. I can't wait to meet this angel goddess of yours."
Nurse Bazooka?
"Hey, I always wanted to show a little leg! (86) (73)"
"Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?"
Time off?
"Aye aye, Mr. Krabs."
"I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary."
"That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward."
What's a vacation?
No work?! But what'll I do all day?
But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Replacement?
I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.
"I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!"
"I'm not here to see you, Squidward."
I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
"You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!"
"You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty."
"Wait, it's not what you think."
But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
"Yes, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset."
"Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up."
"Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up."
"Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming..."
"You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house."
"Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here."
"Patrick, shhh."
"Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh."
"Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs."
"Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off."
"My house is back that way, Mr. K."
Where'd you say you were taking me?
"It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!"
Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
"I've been waiting for you, Patrick!"
"Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television."
"Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!"
You must've saved a fortune.
Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
"Hey, Patrick."
What you doin'?
"That's nice of you, buddy, but I already got an ice cream."
Why would ya? I already got one.
Wow. There goes the nicest guy.
"Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?"
"Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!"
Care to join me?
"Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?"
You have a secret?
"Aye-aye, sir. And who will be in charge while you're gone."
What?
I'm... in charge?
"Yahow!  I won't let you down, sir."
"Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?"
Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.
"Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge.  Charge. Charge."
Do you care now?
"Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle.  Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?"
"Well, it's just that I'm in charge and..."
Regulary scheduled nap?
Really?
"Well, I, um..."
"Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab."
"Order up, Squidward!"
"Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties."
And unclog the sink.
What kind of secret?
Yes?
Me?
"Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire."
I know your secret...
"Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!"
"Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?"
"First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula!  So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!"
Order #12!
Taking out an order!
They are?
"Oh! . It's all coming clear to me now.  There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink.  Enjoy."
"Ooh!  It's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!"
"Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!"
There's another secret? What's the secret?
How?
Sounds like the Chum Bucket.
"Ohhhhh...  How's this, Squidward?"
"You mean, lookin' bad! Enjoy our fine decor!"
"One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!"
Got it!  Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?
Initiating stage two: collateral damage!  How was that?
Ehh...
"Squidward, all the customers are leaving!"
Don't touch the material.
"Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!"
WAIT!!! You don't want to miss... This!
"And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho..."
"I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!"
"M-M-M-M-Mr. Krabs!  We're all out of Krabby Patties, sir."
"You never forget, boss man."
Turmeric.
"That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?"
"Scabs, sir?"
Was it pustule?
"Hmm, I know! To keep Gary out of the biscuit tin, I hide the biscuits somewhere far away, like Patrick's house. Unfortunately, Patrick ends up eating the biscuits anyway."
"I'm warning you, Mr. Krabs, Patrick'll eat anything you give him!"
"Good-bye, secret recipe!"
I believe we were at turmeric.
"Oh, no we forgot to look at the..."
And that formula is...
"Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula."
Uh-huh.
"Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, thank you Mr.--"
I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. (takes the key) It shan't leaveth my sight.
The Oceanic Express. (train whistles) Wish me luck.
"Wow, a real-life butler."
"Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Couldn't be better, butler."
"Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me."
"Thank you, my good man. (hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper) I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy."
"Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters."
"Well, then follow me to the dining car."
Ooh Fancy.
"Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella."
"(sits down) Hi again, kind butler."
(looks at watch) But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
"Oh, sorry, ma'am."
"Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. (SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there)"
"That my dear Patrick is—the key! (sees it missing) Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. (Plankton is walking by angrily)"
Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
"Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you."
"Yes. Search him, Patrick."
"Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops."
"As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act. (SpongeBob points at the baby) Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff."
Mr. Police Commissioner?
I sub-- (turns around and walks into the policeman) I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
"Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key."
The key!
Triplets?
If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
"Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself."
"I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. (a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets)"
"After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. (sobs) I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab."
The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
"Well, that is great news."
"Uh, yeah, me, too. (runs up into the train)"
"I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite."
(sighs) Fresh water.
"Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?"
"That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? (they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off)"
"Patrick, hop up on my back."
Just do it.
"There you go, buddy. (sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton) Oh, Plankton!"
"Alright, Plankton, end of the line! (sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there) Plankton!"
"Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. (sees the engine leaving the train behind) Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look."
"That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there."
"Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open."
(peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off) You broke the brake?
"What do we do now? (starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls) Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!"
"Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train."
"Um, who?"
"Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick."
"Oh, the back of the train is gone!"
"Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?"
What is that?
"'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... (Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks)"
Whoa! Whoa! (the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home)
"Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. (the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville)"
"I simply refused to fail, sir."
(now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom) And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?
Kids today. (snores)
"Whoo! Yeah!  Oh, oh!  Oh!  Ooh!  Oh!"
"Patty, no!  Oh, I can't quite reach it."
"Oh, boy! Looks like I'm taking my career to new heights.  Meep! All right, chimney, prepare to be swept.  There you are!  Good as new!  Hold on, patty! I've got you!  No!"
"Oh, you know, I think I'll just stay up here for a while. It's such a nice day, and all."
"No, I'm good!"
"Aw, thanks, Patrick, but you go on ahead.  I just can't do it. It's too far down!"
Really?
"Uh, never mind, Patrick. I think I'll stay where I am."
"Hey, it's not so bad up here. Pretty great, really. I sure do miss my friends, though. Hey, maybe I can see them from up here."
"Ooh, looks like Squidward has a date. Good for him. It can be so tough to put yourself out there.  Oh, no. Poor Squidward. He's all alone!  Ah!  Don't worry, friend. I'm here for you."
"Hmm, maybe he's hungry.  Come on, Squidward! Eat your...  Ow, hand cramp! Hand cramp! Hand cramp!  Ow-ow-ow-ow!  Guess he wasn't hungry after all. I guess there's nothing left to do but go to sleep.  Oh, I wish I had my bed...  Hey, that gives me an idea."
"Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah."
Perfect. Good night...  nobody.
"Oh, morning, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, Grilly, I thought I'd never see you again!  Something still doesn't feel right, though."
"Perfect! Just like my old kitchen.  I'm ready!  Squidward, order's up! Oh, yeah. I'm stuck up on this roof. Hmm...how do I get these patties down to the customers?  Eureka!"
Whoa! I better make more room up here.
Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.
"You got it, Mr. K."
Aw...
"Aye-aye, sir!"
Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing!  Whoo!
Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!
And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!
"Yes, the end.  Quitting time is almost too much to bear."
"Good night, sir.  See ya tomorrow."
"Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye  Toodaloo! Whoa!"
This isn't a pile of trash.  It's a free computer system.
"Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton."
Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
"Yeah, I think so."
Must be the dial-up thingy!
"Hey, there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean, you guys were made for each other. Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?"
"Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton."
All right!
"Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?"
"No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab."
"Well, we could rebuild Karen 2."
"Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?"
Who's that?
"Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!"
"Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick."
"It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!"
"Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back."
"No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?"
"Oh, Squidward, you jokester."
"Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?"
"It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-"
"Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them."
I don't think you should do that.
"Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy."
Please don't.
"Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started."
"Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?"
"Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control."
She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
Patrick?
"Aw, she's something, all right!"
"Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot."
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good."
You know what this means...
By the power of Neptune!
"Creatures of the deep, assemble!  Think... harder... Barnacle Boy...  Here they come!"
"Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful."
"If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak."
"Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave."
Reflecto has found our secret lab.
"Elaborate, you vile fiend!"
"Hmm, they must be working undercover."
"Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?"
Patrick! Can you believe it?
Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
But you can't retire. There's evil afoot!
"All I said was, there's evil afoot."
"Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
"What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience.  The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement!"
"Hey, Mermaid Man."
Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae.  And he globs onto the undersea dome.  And he starts sucking on the glass.
"You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement."
"No, but I'm married."
"Oh, myah. This purse is so big and heavy."
AHHHH! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
"Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?"
"Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open!"
"Excuse me, Mermaid Man."
This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile!
"Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Mission accomplished, Patrick!"
Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Boo! Who likes eggs?
"Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary."
Nice and cozy.
"Where am I?  Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets.  Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do?  Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive!  Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut.  I've got a lucky peanut!"
"I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes!  Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing.  Hello?  Shell-lo?"
"Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?"
"Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees.  Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars.  Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees..."
"There's another tree.  And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works.  Tree, tree, tree, tree."
Rawr! Hmm?
"Oh, hello."
"Wow!  Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it.  Wow!  I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals."
"Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!"
"Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty."
"I respect you, Barnacle Man!"
Evil?
Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble!
"Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?"
You can't give up. What if we help you?
Okay!
I do!
Wow! The Mermalair!
"Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too."
Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  You want to see me do it again?
Holy halibut! It's the chief!
"Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!"
Make that two!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...glad that's over!
You must be the new driving instructor.
"Student driver. That's me. I just don't take a bad picture, do I?"
Great! Look how I can tune the radio.
I thought it'd made me look cool.  Guess not.
"Ohhhhh, that I can do!"
Good baby?
"I say, how's my automobiling?"
"Excuse me sir, I'm in the middle of a driving lesson!"
You got it! Turning around!
"Oh, you're a great instructor! What now?"
I don't understand how this is gonna help with my driving.
"Hey, I've heard of that!"
Distract with the abstract.
What's the next lesson?
"Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy."
Ah! Wha— Oop.  Whoa!
"I know just the place! But first, let me adjust your seat."
"Oh! Ooh, driving range!"
How's my driving?
"Doh! That kinda hurts, don't ya think?"
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh!  Oh, yeah."
"Would you like to test me on road signs now? Let's see...  Stop, No Left Turn, and that one over there that says Falling Rocks!"
Mrs. Puff!
"Hey, Mrs. Puff! The new instructor's been teaching me so much. Not as much as you. But y'know, different things."
He hasn't taught me that one yet!  Oh!
"Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks."
"Aye, aye, professor!"
"Hey, where'd the new instructor go? Oh, well, I still have ten minutes left on my driving lesson.  Oh, Mrs. Puff?"
Wait for it...
"Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?"
Yeah.
"Aww, yeah."
"Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter."
Yes.
"Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts."
Who?
Who?
"He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?"
"Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?"
"Yeah, Strangler."
"Hey, that looks like me!"
"You nice officers will protect me, right?"
Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard!
"This would be him, Mr. Krabs."
"Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard."
"You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture."
"I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty."
"Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?"
Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium.
"Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?"
We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
"Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands."
"Quick is my middle name.  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?"
I'll take both!
Hmmm.
"I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?"
"Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have."
Protect me?
"Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?"
"Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?"
"Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible.  Ya."
"I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!"
"Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside..."
"Well, here we are."
"I know, isn't it great?  Ooh."
"A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?"
"Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest.  Ahh, alone at last."
"Just you, me, and the floorboards.  Yeah."
How did you guys know today is my birthday?
Thanks for coming!  Alone again.
Uh-huh.
Oh yeah.
Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
"So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy."
He's not?
"Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?"
"Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!"
I'm not safe! Come back!
"Good idea, bodyguard. They’ll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!"
The Strangler!
"Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test.  Mrs. Puff, you okay?"
"Right away, ma’am.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control..."
"Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-"
"I...I...  I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!"
"Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth?  Come back later; I'm wallowing."
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight."
"Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un-"
"Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?"
It's not working!
"Uh, where are we?"
Dr-iving test?!
"But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?"
"Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!"
"O-o-okay.  Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff."
"Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road."
Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.
Focus on the road.  There is nothing but the road.
"Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
Focus on the road...  There is nothing but the road.
"Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road.  Focus...  on the...road? What happened to the road!?"
"Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!"
"Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh...  The road!"
That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.
Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!
"Right. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road  I can't even see the road! ."
"Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?"
"Sorry, Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes!"
Huh? Oh! Okay!
Wooo-ooo!
"Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up!  Oh, aren't you just too cute.  Coochie coochie coo!"
"Oh, sure thing, Plankton.  Here you go, little guy."
Police! Police!
"Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby!  It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula!  What do we do, Squidward?"
"Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty?  That's it, drink up!  Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty?  Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of 20s?"
Plankton!
"Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!"
I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.
"What was that, sonny?"
What?
Catch who?
"Come back here, you little whippersnapper!"
I'm catching up with my knitting.
"What's wrong, little feller?"
"Hold still, Gary."
Almost done.
"That's great, Patrick. What's it for?"
For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?
"Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake."
"Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?"
Exactly!
"No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet."
"Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day."
But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.
"Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something."
Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Smaller.
Smaller.
The smallest you can think of.
Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.
"And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?"
"You have to work for it, remember?"
Pick up order!
"No, you have to take the tray to the customer."
Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.
Nope.
Let's try something different.
All you have to do is answer the phone.
"Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant."
It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?
You'll do fine.
"Keep trying, Patrick."
Kitchen!
"Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle."
"You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!"
"Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly."
"No, no, Patrick, you did it!"
"That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it."
"That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?"
"Well, back to the ol' grind."
Forget my hat.
Dropped my spatula.
Aha!  You're copying me!
Why are you doing that?
"Well, it's annoying, so stop it!"
"Say, you're good."
At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Stop copying me!
"Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?"
We'll see about that!
I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
"Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me."
"Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?"
"I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob."
"But, Patrick..."
Another trophy?
'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
"So, what are you gonna do, now?"
"This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty!  Whoo!  Whoop, whoop.  Ooh.  Aah.  Whew. ' Ow!"
"Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?"
"Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it."
"That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth."
Aww.
"Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer!  Ow!"
Why? Why did I pretend?
Huh...Patrick?
Whaddya wanna do today?
"Well, I guess we could play something.  How about a yo--?"
Yo.  Buried Treasure Board Game?
Dollies?
How about this?
"Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures! Ew. Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy."
"Ugh, there is just nothing to play with."
"Hi, Squidward. Can you think of anything fun we can do?"
Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest...  Toy store?!  Ahhhhh!
Oh yeah!
"Well, we're here."
"Well, I guess it's not open yet."
"I got it.  Patrick! Patrick, get up..."
"Look.  Wow!  Patrick, look at that."
That depends. Tell me. Do you like to  sing?!
Ahem!  ♪La...
"♪Toys! Glorious toys! La, la, la! Toys! Yeah!♪ Hey, Patrick."
It's not a tutu! It's a man-tu! You can tell because it has  extra support.  I got the last one.
What a great day! I hope it never ends!
Aw. The store's closing. We'll have to leave now.
"Patrick, we have to leave."
But they'll just come and kick us out!
Hide? Isn't that kinda sneaky?
No. But I do now. What do we do first?!
"Thanks, pal. Well, we did it. Yay!"
Nothing can ruin it!
"Patrick, is that you?"
"I said, Is that you?"
You have Night Vision?
How long have you had that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Calm down, buddy. We just need to find a light switch. But ya have to put me down first."
Yes.
By... toys?
Gah!  Eeeeeeee!
No.
No. We're going to fight back and we are going to win!
"Ready, Patrick?"
"It was nice knowin' ya, pal."
"Patrick, don't!"
My eyes!
What's going on Mr. Krabs?
"Whatever you say, cap'n."
"Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium."
"Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there."
"That's some good news, Mr. Krabs."
"Right away, sir."
"Get up, Patrick! It's time!"
The big shin-dig! Remember?
"That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship."
Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine!  I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend.
Guess what?
I'm going to the beach with my best friend!  Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!
"Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?"
"You know what this situation calls for. Patrick!  A few verses of the best friend tune! ♪Ohhhh best fr-♪  Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are."
No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here!
"Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!"
"I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name."
"Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll  toss it to you!"
Ready?!
"Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or..."
"I know, we can make sand castles!"
"No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?"
"Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over."
"I'm just trying to help, buddy!"
"Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side."
"All right, Patrick, have it your way.  You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine."
"I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh, sir, you built onto my side."
"So, you don't do that!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border."
But what for what!?
"Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?"
"Oh, is that so!? Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on!  Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off."
Fine! Have it your way.
Come on!  How do you like them apples?
"Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?"
Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
"All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun!"
Jumping jellyfish! WHOA!
Ohhhh.
"I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away."
"No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson."
Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
"No, I can!"
I can!
"Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over."
"But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill."
But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
"Order up, Squidward."
"Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders."
Because it growled at me.
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!"
"Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?"
"Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'."
"Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility..."
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs."
"Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning."
Wait just a burger-flipping second!
"That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea."
I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs!
"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!"
"Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing."
No.
"So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink."
"♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love cookin' me some Krabby Patties! Feedin' all the children and the mommies and the daddies! Love servin' up the most delicious dish, but before I can, gotta add a little of this!♪  Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce.  Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. Use on or before the date printed below.  This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?"
"Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy."
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the..."
"What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading."
"Hey, nice pass, Squidward!"
You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
A four-striped sock! Incredible!
"Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone."
"Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?"
After you then!
"You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would."
"Patrick, you're very good at that!"
"He shoots, he scores!"
"Hey, Squidward, what are you doing?"
"I know, but what are you doing?"
Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
"Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years."
I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here!  It's our favorite game!
"Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?"
My right foot was on blue.
Left foot on green. [kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick
Hmmm.
"Wow, a water fountain for short people! What will the future think of next?"
"Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?"
Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?
"Me too!  Do you want one too, Squidbeard?"
Whoa!
Ooh!
"What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred."
"Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?"
"Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?"
How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?
"Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy."
"Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory."
No problem.
"You love music, right, Squidward?"
Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!
See? Your happiest memory is forming!
Oops. That was a sour note.
"Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!"
Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!
Your happiest memory?
Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!
What a majestic view!
Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?
Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down!
Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles!
"Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!"
Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!
Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?
"Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? Hello!?  Hello?"
"Hi, Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?"
"Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!"
"Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?"
So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?
Sigh... he's so handsome!
"Are ya ready to go, Patrick?"
"Patrick, it's me!"
"Ew, what's this?"
It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
"You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet?"
"Hey, that's my comic book money!"
Patrick.
No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back?
Good luck.  Coming--
You have to think of the words yourself.
"Oh, Patrick!"
Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
No!
"You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?"
"Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?"
"That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window."
"Patrick, don't strain yourself."
"Come on, let's hear it!"
I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
"Uh, Patrick?"
It's really loud!
Oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
We need to get that song on the radio!
"Darn, I just got that arm back."
Did you see the look on his face?
"I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?"
I got an idea!  We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
Huh? Patrick--
"Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs."
"Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick!"
"Look at that, Patrick!"
"That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!"
"Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius."
"Good night, Mr. Krabs."
I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.
"Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?"
It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...
"Mr. Krabs, did you forget?"
Tomorrow is Bring Your Pet To Work day!
Umm... Can I buy that patty?
Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!
"Good idea!  Thanks again, Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!"
We're all out of Krabby Patties!
"I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!"
We don't have an attic.
"You sold it, remember?"
A fresh batch?
"When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?"
"Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!"
"No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!"
Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
"There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries.  I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy those.  Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary?  Gary?  Gary?!  Gary, not again. Come out of there, it's dirty!  Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou...."
"Great, Gary, just great. Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not gonna come down from there, are you?"
"Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning."
Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
Gary! The bath is ready!
Gary! Your bath is ready!
"Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for Bring your pet to work day! And today is the day!  First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!"
"Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?"
Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime!
"Bet that feels good, huh?"
"Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?"
Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
"You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick.  Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?"
Is that yes? Or no?
"Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals."
"Oh, Gary!"
"Please try to save him, doctor!"
Gary!
"You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh.  Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end."
"Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know, it's... it's really poignant."
"Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you!"
"Just a little further, Gare-Bare."
"Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear."
"Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay."
Marco!
Marco?
"Okay, bye.  Marco."
Marco!
Marco! Marco!  Marco?
"Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick."
Ugh.  Marco.
Marco!
Marco!
"Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance.  I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?"
What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
They are about to name the boy...
Polo.
Whoo-hoo!  Marco.
Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.
"Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪"
♪Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪  Ehh.
"The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo."
Old stuff? Like what?
"Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing?"
We could build sandcastles.
"Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles?  Nothing bad about a bubble."
"No, I just think we should act our age.  Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?"
"Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh."
"Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree."
"Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!"
Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
Are you ready to get down?
"No, not like that. Like this!"
"Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches!  Yeah!"
"Oh, clear!"
Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
"Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease, and sugar."
"Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this."
I can help you with that.  Eww.
"Old people, behave!"
Oh.
"I'm coming, Patrick!"
"Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer?  Whoa. Where have the years gone?  I'm losing steam."
Gotcha!
"Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?"
"Patrick, those are hash browns."
"Um, Patrick, the slides."
Now you put the slides in the projector.
"Ooh, a shadow puppet show!"
Sorry.
"Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?"
"Pal, what you need is a vacation."
"Yes, he'd like a vacation."
Stay home? That's it! You can take a stay-cation.
"Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free."
"All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation."
"Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?"
"Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star.  Patrick Star, room 801.  Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.  May I take your bags, Mr. Star?"
"Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way.  Your room, sir."
"Something wrong, Mr. Star?"
Arranged?
"Mr. Star, are you sure about this?"
The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.
"The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up.  Your diving board, sir."
"You okay, sir?"
"Oh, no!  Lifeguard on duty!  You okay, sir?"
This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.
"Follow me, sir.  If you would take your seat, sir.  Your dining bib, sir."
One Krabby Patty coming up.
"Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir.  Presenting the SpongeBob Follies!  What the hey."
"Well, what do you think?"
"Aw, it was nothing."
"What?  Oh, no, the Krabby Patty!"
"Mr. Star, your meal is ready.  Patrick, where is he?  Ah!"
"So tired.  Patrick, what are you doing here?"
"Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
Mm-mmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Good night, sir."
"Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!"
Ready to go?
"No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?"
How about now?
Now?
Now?
How about now?
Now?
Now?
Now?
Now?
Ready yet?
Sure we do.
Ready?
I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.
"Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!"
Does this mean you wanna go...
"Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops."
"Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!"
"Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm."
"You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out."
Onward... to Squidward's house.
"To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?"
Who?
"Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?"
"SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut."
"It says... It's dark in here. Got anything else, Sandy?"
"So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine."
"We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!"
"They're looking for an invention, right?"
So let's start inventing!
"It's time to get serious, Patrick."
"That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented."
"Light bulb, already invented."
"That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented."
Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.
"I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here."
Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!
"Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!"
My name is SpongeBob.
Professor?
She should be back any moment.
Patrick!
"Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?"
Well?
"Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!"
Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!
"Patrick, don't you think we should test it?"
That's not exactly what I had in mind!
"Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick."
Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.
Oh I really wish Sandy were here.
Sandy!
"I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay."
"Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!"
"Mr. Krabs, what do we do?"
"Well, I."
"Well, I've been thinking."
"No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish."
"I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles!"
"And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener."
It's all yours.
"All yours, old friend.  Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have."
"No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish."
"Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz."
"I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home!  Brothers and sisters, wait for me!  Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here!  Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go...  ...that way.  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  This is the life.  Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz?  Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are?  Uhh... nice to meet you."
"Patrick, I'm not coming home."
I'm happy here. This is my home now.
"Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this.  Patrick! What are you doing?"
Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now!
Patrick! No!
"Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters.  Mmm, jelly.  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning.  Greetings, comrades!  Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy!  Ah! Poison sea urchins!  Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches.  Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.  Krabby Patties.  Sandy.  What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up."
You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Don't mind if I do.
"Aye, aye, captain!"
Don't mind if I do.  Ta-da.  Aww.
It is great to be home!
What's going on? What could it mean?
I challenge your gadget! I declare patty war!
I won't be defeated!
I won't lose to that thing!
"Foul beast, do your worst!"
Whoo! Yeah!
"Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that.  It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual.  The customer is always right, when they have money."
"I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs."
Hmm?  Ow! Mr. Krabs!  You gotta calm down!
I feel so secure.
And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.
Order up!
"Psst, psst!"
"Come on, Larry. It'll be fun."
"Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?"
"Oh, no. They normally eat like this!"
"Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!"
"Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty."
"But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here."
"Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste."
"No, Larry. No."
I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.
"Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the..."
Larry?
Sorry!
Pardon my reach.
"Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym."
"Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired."
I'm on it!
Butter!  Lard!  Mayonnaise.
"And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise!  Here you go."
"Okay, that failed. What now?"
Gotcha!
"Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now."
What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.
"Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them."
"Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!"
Fire!
Yeah!
"Give into the flavor, Larry!"
"He's too fast. We need a distraction.  Here, use this."
"Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape.  Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers."
Order up!
"And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!  That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary?  Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary?  Well, I guess I should turn off the light now.  Sure is dark.  Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark.  Whoa! Another monster!  Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of!  What was that?"
"Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today!"
The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
"Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!"
"Great idea, Mr. Krabs."
"Yes, it's working..."
You want me to go in there?
"Save me, the darkness!"
Night light?
"Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Night light, night light... Oh!  Oh, it's beautiful!  Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?"
"Now that I can see...  Woo-hoo! I can sleep!  I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom!  Night light! Night light!  Oh, thank you, thank you!  There, there, there, and there.  I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary.  Now there's not one square inch of dark!"
"What was that, Gary?"
"You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me!"
"That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!"
"Wait, Patrick!  What is that, Gary?  Patrick, what are you doing!?"
"You know what that means?  Sleepover!  Your sleeping bag, sir."
"Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t..."
"The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us..."
"But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-"
"Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?"
"You said it, Pat!"
Mermaid Man!?
Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you."
"Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here!"
"Say, let me help you!  Is that enough light for you?  Well, he's all taken care of."
"The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon!"
"We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter."
Pat! Come ba...
"Uh, me make Krabby Patties."
"Um, Plankton, can I come out now?"
Yeah.
"You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn."
"Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas."
"Great! Well, see ya out there."
Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.  Let me have that diploma!
"Mr. Krabs, your diploma!"
Ta-da!
I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!
Why'd you do that?
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure."
I can't! I've got stage fright!
"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?  Huh? Oh!"
D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
"ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers."
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room."
"ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?"
"Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir."
"Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!"
En garde!
I learned a very valuable lesson today.
"Well, yeah, that, but  mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer."
Ow.
"What is it, Squidward?"
"Okay, Patrick! Here I come!"
"Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking."
Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
"Well, who knows how long it... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!"
"You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look, Patrick!"
Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
"Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up.  That's right, just bring in here. Careful, careful now. That's right."
"Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend?"
"That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley."
"Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft spots in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's right. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends.  Oh, my goodness! Patrick, oh! Oh, Patrick, please do something!"
"Okay, Patrick, see you later then."
"All right, Gary, just so there isn't more upset, I'm gonna ask that you sleep on the guest newspaper tonight, and Mr. Wormsley is going to be sleeping in here with me.  Now, now, Gary, there's no need for protest.  See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are.  Night, Gare."
"Oh, sounds like Patrick is having one of his night fits again. I'll just close the window.   Mr. Wormsley!  Whoa! I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move! Just, uh, read the sports section or something."
He's in here.  Oh! I can't watch!
Yes?
"Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle."
Wait till Gary sees.
"See, Gare? Right in here. They're gone asleep."
"Well, these things take time."
He's chased her away! Now who will care for her abandoned litter of adorable newborn infants?
"I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset."
"Nope, you and I are just gonna have to find loving homes for each and every one of these little guys. Right, Patrick?  Patrick?  Don't worry, little guys. Squidward is a really good friend of mine, and he really likes pets."
"Squidward, I came over with a very special surprise."
How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
Baby worms. See? Aren't they just adorable at that age?
"So, how many did you want?"
"Good morning, Mrs. Puff."
Would you like a baby worm?
"Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!"
"Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you.  Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some...  Ma'am?  That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?"
Probably not.
So I see.
"Oh, Larry, wait."
"Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms."
"Well, yeah!"
Really?
"Larry, no!"
"Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised.  Hello?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live."
Yeah.
Really?
"Well, okay."
"Oh, he likes you."
"Oh, well. At least I still have you guys."
"Enjoy your new home, little guy."
"That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs."
What's that?
Oh!
"Aah! Thanks, Larry!"
"Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?"
"Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?"
Squishy.
Hooray!
I'm ready!
"Yes, sir!"
"Ok, I will!"
"Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers.  Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, Beautiful Angel. That's normal, right?"
"I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things."
How am I doing?
"Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!"
I'll be there!
"Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh.  Only now, I'll do it on my back."
"I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not."
Always be hydrating.
Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
Yeah?
"Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!"
"Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?"
Larry?
"Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go."
"Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!"
"No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly."
"Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today."
"I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back."
Walk on your back.
And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
"I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs."
"You wanted to see me, sir?"
"I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty..."
This sounds great.
"Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!"
You mean a br-ug?
"Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!"
"Whoa, what happened?"
"Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!"
Br-ug.
"Oh, what a great day."
"Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking!"
"Already done, sir!"
"Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!"
Done and dusted!
"Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?"
"Well, I'm not!"
"Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?"
The Yeti Krab?
"Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge."
Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
"Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!"
"If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!"
"Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!"
"You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay."
"Good day, sir. Are you Yeti to order?  Oh, Squidward!"
You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
"Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!"
"Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!"
"Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!"
"Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded."
"Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant!"
Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say!
Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!
T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs!
"Guys, do you hear that?"
"No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me."
Done!
Done!
Consider it done!
"I think I can explain.  Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes."
"Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs.  Patrick, what's up, buddy?"
That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch.
"Patrick, that's not a...  trash bag."
"Good morning, Squidward!"
I'll help you Squidward!
"I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty.  Tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy.  I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!"
Please let me help!
Please?
Pretty please?
Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?
"Hi, lady!"
Can I help you now?
"Yay!  Thank you, Squidward."
"First, close your eyes!"
C'mon!
No peeking.
Okay! You can open your eyes now!
I put it in...
"Squidward, that... that's a beautiful thing to say!"
"I am angry? Squidward, why are you angry?"
Yes.
Your garbage.
On top of your garbage.  The dump was closed.  So I bought it here.
Like this.  Do you wanna try?
"Hey, Squidward..."
"Oh, a statue, eh?  Hey, Squidward! Look!"
Your very own statue!
You sure are!
"Oh, I'm bored."
Old Man Squidward's shed?!
"I don't know, Patrick."
It's Old Man Squidward!
"Yes, Patrick?"
"Yes, Patrick!"
"Don't hurt us, Squidward!"
We just wanted to play with your...  ...whatever this thing is.
"Thanks for letting us mow your lawn, Squidward!  Ahhh! My patty flipping hand!"
You're not The Flying Dutchman!
Ooh! It makes you look a thousand years younger!
"I'm sorry. But, we don't know what it's like to be ghosts."
We're ghosts!  Yaayyy!
It's SpongeBob.
"We're going to haunt you! Foreeever!  Oooooohhh—!  Well, that killed the mood."
"Good night, Patrick. Being a ghost can sure tire ya out!"
"That's odd. However shall I get in?  That's handy!  I am beat! Well, I don't have to take the stairs!  Ah. ."
"Hey, Patrick. I didn't sleep so good last night."
I'm late for work!
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'm here!"
"Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
"Aye, aye, old living employeer!"
"La la la la!  I can't cook Krabby Patties! I don't wanna be a ghost anymore, Patrick!"
Yeah! Let's go see the Flying Dutchman!
"Please, Mr. Dutchman, we can't take it! Constantly moaning and groaning!"
Living without a soul!
How could anyone live like this?!
Hey! We're still ghosts!
But we want to be normal now!
"We're still ghosts, because you can't go on your date?"
"Well, here we are several months later! I wonder how the Flying Dutchman's doing on his date!"
"Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!"
"Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer."
"With pleasure, sir!"
"Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?"
"Oh, boy! Jellyfishing. I can't wait! Can you, Patrick?  Patrick? Patrick?"
"Uh, I said...  Ow!"
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
"Hey, heroes! Is there anything we can do?  That's a heavy piece of nothing...  So, is that it?"
"Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582! Man Ray's power glove!"
The Dirty Bubble's bubble wand!
"Oh, where are we?  It can't be! Bikini Bottom has at least 39 people living here!"
Oh! Everything looks so old-fashioned.
"Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time. Hello, fellow citizen.  Hello, Squilliam."
Yeah.  Must be taking care of his community service obligations.
"Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city?"
"I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?"
"Even worse than that, Patrick. The police got new uniforms!"
"And yikes! What happened to the Krusty Krab?!  The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?"
"No, Patrick. It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past. And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler. Oh, we got to do something."
What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis. See if I still have a job!
"Excuse me, Squidw..."
Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here?
"Mermaid Man! He's wearing a hairnet!  What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?"
"What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight."
I am so sorry for your loss of... yourself.
"Sorry, Mermaid Man. We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help, of course."
Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?
Oh. Let's get the nasty thing off of you.
"I can't get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?"
Ta-daaa! You're free! Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?
"Actually, we're fighting Man Ray."
We just wanted to come back and revisit the day that evil was defeated forever.
"I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping.  Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly."
Mr. Krabs!
What is going on out there?
"I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around."
"Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?"
"Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures."
We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr-
"It's the only way, Mr. Krabs.  Alright, sir, it's time."
But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
I do.  Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
"It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties!"
"Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns.  No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope."
"Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed."
"Here let me help you, Squidward."
"Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!"
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this."
New... Different...  That's it!
"Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!"
All new free Krabby Patties!
It's working!
"We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!"
"Oh, money angels, can I make one?"
Hear what?
"So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So..."
"So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in."
They weren't overcooked at all!
"Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?"
"Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?"
Ooh!
"Yes, Squidward?"
"Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock."
"Why, thank you, Patrick!"
Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.
"How may I serve you, sir?"
"Oh, yes, sir!"
"Thanks, Squidward!"
"Aye aye, guest sir."
"Your room, sir."
"Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir."
"Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair."
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese."
"No good, Mr. Krabs."
There's room for you to sit up front!
"Me, too."
"Aw, thanks,  and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work."
I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
"Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh!  Hm!  Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze.  Whoa-ow-ow-ow!}"
Morning.
"Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time."
I hear 'em in there.
"Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner."
"Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!"
"Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?"
"I  Don't!  Know!  It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it,  see? There's room for one more."
"You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet."
"Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet?  So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?"
"Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean...  All right, I'll partner up with you this time.  Huh?"
"Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?"
Sorry.
Huh?
"You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal?"
Makeover?
New shoes?
"Hey, check out the dame."
"Oh, uh, we're playing Good cop, good cop. Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!"
Good contours.  And still warm. Story checks out.
"Mm, hmm."
"Squidward, wait!  Let him handle this."
Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?
I am so sorry for your loss.
Patrick Star?
Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...
"Right behind you, pal.  Huh?  Whoa!"
"Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play!"
"Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music."
"Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went?  Huh?"
"Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward!"
"There you are, sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton."
"Yes, sir!"
"I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!"
"Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!"
"But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!"
"Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!"
"Oh, yes, please, sir, please!"
"Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!"
"But, sir!"
"But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. Anything!"
Wh-what?
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh..."
A pro- a promo- a promotion?!
Register!
"It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!"
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
"Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window!"
"Alternate-Universe SpongeBob appears at the table, next to Mr. Plankton] I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did."
"A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!"
"No, sir, he's back."
Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!
He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!
He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.
"It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant."
Yeah! But the worst part is...
"I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes... no service!"
"Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!"
"You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!"
"Phone call, Mr. Plankton."
"It's laundry day, Gary!  Oops."
) Now to finish the day's chores.  Hello?
"Mm, speaking."
"Actually, Patrick, I'm kind of busy. Can it wait?"
"Gary, go check on the laundry in the dryer."
"Yeah, Patrick.  Gary?  They've shrunk!  I'm gonna need to get new pants."
"Oh.  No. Nope. Ew, not these. Uh-uh.  Whoa, these pants hug my body better than my own mother!  Hey, Patrick! Notice anything different? Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose."
"It's me, SpongeBob."
Patrick is so full of tartar sauce. I'm still me. It's just a pair of pants. It's not like my friends won't recognize me.
"Sandy didn't recognize me either. These pants are more powerful than I thought. Course it was just Sandy, and Neptune knows what goes on inside a squirrel's head.  But I know my best buddy Squidward will recognize me. We have been through so much together."
"Hi, Squidward!"
"Oh, Squidward! Guess who?"
"Oh, sure you do. It's me, SpongeBob... SquarePants."
"Well, maybe these pictures of us together will job your memory.  Me and you at my birthday party.  You and me at work.  That little slumber party we had last week.  I forgot when this was taken."
"Squidward didn't know me either. It's like we'd never met. Maybe Patrick is right.  Oh no, it's locked.  Gary! Hey, Gary! Can you open the door?! I left my keys in the other pants."
"Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob."
"Patrick, what are you doing in my house?"
"Oh, barnacles! I guess I'm not 'SpongeBob SquarePants' anymore. I'll have to start all over again.  Hello, sir. I'd like an application, please. My name is SpongeBob Sq...  Sorry, I'm a little...  I'm a little...  I'm a little nervous. My name is SpongeBob... RoundPants. And I would like to seek employment at this eating establishment.  Oh, dear! Are you ok, Mr. Cashier? Ooh!  Here are the applications.  Let's see here. Name.  SpongeBob RoundPants. Well, this is going well.  Hey, Mr. Cashier, looks like we're gonna be coworkers!  Question two. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Hmm, what's a felony?"
"Oh, yeah! Lots and lots of felonies."
I'm filling out an application.
Then I got the job?!
My first day on the job. I am so excited. Woo-hoo!
You've worked here a long time. Why don't you show this rookie the ropes?
Yay!
So what do I do first?
Shouldn't you watch it?
"Ooh, very Zen.  What next, oh, oracle of Krabby wisdom?"
"Hmm, I'll go, too.  How's it going in there, boss?"
"Going fine.  Oh, Mr. Squidward...  Whatcha reading?  Bathroom break. Check."
Be rude to customers and insult food. Nasally laugh.
No.
Oh I think you've had way too many of those.
"I am not SpongeBob SquarePants, Mr. Krabs."
"I mean, do these pants look square to you? They're round."
I can't be SpongeBob SquarePants with round pants.
Patrick.
"Order up, Squidward."
"Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?"
"Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way."
"Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots."
Who's that?
♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
And...
"Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!"
"Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?
"Or could he do this?  Or this?  And watch this, Mr. Krabs!"
"Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?"
"And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this."
"Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off."
"Good night, Gary."
Mr. Krabs!
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!"
"No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
"Yes, it is!"
They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots.
"I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants ."
"Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this..."
"Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?"
"You really think so, Mr. Krabs?"
"Bye, Mr. Krabs!"
"♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude♪"
♪I cherish my fellow residents...♪
"Oh, I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!"
"Hit it, boys! ♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude. A lifetime subscription to gratitude. Friend, you've got to change your latitude. Live an attitude of gratitude, I'm grateful for the life I'm living. Who knows how long I will have it? I'm thankful for all I've been given. We make appreciation a habit. There's no time like the present day to have a present come your way!"
So now I think that you will see.
"There's nothing more you need. My friend, this ain't no platitude."
Just an attitude of gratitude.♪
"Or, in your case, Squidward, an attitude of hattitude!"
"Wow, Squidward, you should really consider getting your plumbing looked at."
"Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand."
"No problem, pal."
"What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?"
"Well, it could be worse."
That's how.
"Sorry to interrupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it?  Fear not, shelter can't be far a-"
"Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something."
"Actually, I just had a question about these parking tickets. I don't have a car."
"Hey, Squidward, who do you think is the most miserable person?"
"But, Squidward, it's imperative that we..."
Wait! It is I who makes Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead.
Squidward!
"I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!"
"Squidward, I always knew you felt that way.  Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us."
"Well, I wouldn't say that."
"Yes, sir!"
"Oh, you can count on me, sir.  Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here.  Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?"
"Barnacles!  There he is. Just in time for breakfast.  Oh, I am such a clumsy oaf. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here.  Oh, no! Too late! No! No!  Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later."
"Oh, fishpaste!"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop.  There's your chum, bleep blap blop."
"Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me."
So you're saying that you love chum? And all that you ever eat is chum?
Interesting.
I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.
"Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist.  I mean, just think about that.  You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the..."
"Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!"
New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or--
"Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming.  Well, I'm not dreaming."
"Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?"
"That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal:  Stay back! I'm warning you!"
"No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy!  Holy shrimp! They're everywhere!"
"No, no! I want to live!  I want to live"
"Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties."
Spatular.
Grill.
What does this mean?
Wrestler?
"Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist?  Ow!  Hey, look at this! Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias. Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see...  Well, this looks like the place.  Hello? Doctor?"
"You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink . Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?"
"Oh, good."
Jumping jacks?
I see giant Krabby Patties!

They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back!

I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano.

Hypnosis?!
Where am I?
"Gee, thanks!"
"The king of flavored dairy drinks!  Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again."
In my heart?
It worked! I'm cured!
"Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!"
"Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all."
"Oh, Mr. Krabs...!"
I'm trying!
"Yes, Mrs. Puff!"
Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles!
"So, uh, how'd I do?"
But—but—
"I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!"
"Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?"
"Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later."
Ooh!  Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles.  Oh! That's it!
"All right, all right."
"Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?"
You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
Gary!
"You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!"
Then I made a right turn on red like this.
"You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!"
Hmm?
"Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats."
"Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves."
One bubble boat coming right up!
"I sure do, Plankton!"
"I'm on it, Larry!"
I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo!
"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P.  You'll be learning from a master."
Whoa!
"Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this."
Nice start.
"Mrs. Puff, you're ready."
Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there.
Nice and easy. Doing great.
"Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!"
It's okay! Just calm down!
Ah!
Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
Doh!
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles?"
"Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪"
"Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!"
"Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up."
That's good. I'm all warmed up.
Hi-uh!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Ahh! Ooh.
I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
Anti-gravity? Yes!  Yah!
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge.
"Hey, what happened to the surface?"
"Hmm. Huh?  Aw, gee, and I was so close.  Hmm? What is this place?"
Oh!
Uh-huh.
"This place is trash-tastic!  Ow!  Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh!"
Hmm? I thought I saw something over— Ow!  Hello? Who are you?
Ow! Old Man Jenkins?
"Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon!"
And you're Old Man Jenkins!
"Well, we could build a ladder out of this stuff and climb down—ooh, uh, down?"
Uh-uh. I'm juvenile!
Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that!  I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
"Oh, yes! It's the biggest whoop! Let's go home!"
I'm not shaking it!
Ooh-whaa!
Everybody climb back down! There's nothing up there!  I dove up and found Old Man Jenkins living among all these objects.
No! Ahh! Ohh—ow!
They called me a hero.
Your turn.
"Hey, Patrick."
Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with...  two sticks?
"I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing Stick in a Cup."
Free my mind! Free my mind! Free my mind!
I want it!
"No, I want it!"
"No, it's mine!"
"No, it's mine!"
"Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain."
"Step one...  Oh, I see what to do."
"It's just me, Patrick."
"Now, you do me!"
It's time to free our minds!
"Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angle before!"
Eye bump!
"Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?"
"Hey, Patrick. I know who we can spy on."
"Hey, where's Squidward? I'm sure I saw him in here."
Found him!
"Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!"
"Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!"
"Hey, what's going on? Everything went dark! Uh, Patrick, can you see anything?"
"Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!"
"Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!"
"Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy!"
"Brainy, where are you?"
I've found mine too!
"Oh, darn it. I still can't see."
"Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something."
Ew! Give me that!
"Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy."
"Patrick, I meant on the phone."
"Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things."
"Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room."
Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again!
"Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Patrick?
"Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today."
"Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?"
Are you ready to go crazy?
Are you ready to—
"Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!"
Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!
What do you think we should do first?
"Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?"
"You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!"
"I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late."
"Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?"
"Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?"
"I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?"
Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker.
"Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself."
Only the cool kids.
"We're not lost, I've got my compass."
"Goodbye, pals!"
Here we are: The Wash.
"Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool."
"Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!"
You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.
"Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!"
"So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?"
"Don't worry, you will.  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?"
"Patrick, that's not a ride."
"Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?"
"How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?"
Lame?!
We score here all the time.
"Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!"
Why didn't you ask?
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs."
"Good night, Mr. Krabs."
"Psst, try the coral bits."
What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
"Congratulations, Mr. Krabs."
"Wow, a trip!"
"Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?"
Okay!
Here she comes...  ...she made it!
I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.
"Aye aye, captain!"
"Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary."
"Oh, I get ya."
"Actually, it's Coral Blue number t-"
Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
What do you mean?
"Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you-"
You're right. How do we get outta here?
Okay.
"Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives.  Why couldn't it have been me?!"
"Why did he have to go like this, why?!"
"Wow, how did you get it back?"
What did you give him?
"Oh my. It's time to go home. Squidward, what are you still doing here?"
What am I gonna do with you? I can't throw you away.  Bleh!  But I do have to throw away the trash.
"What's this? Someone threw away a book. You shouldn't throw away books.  Ooh, Sandy, you're a trash monster?"
Wow!
Let's see. Ooh. World's longest tongue.
"Hold tight, Sandy."
"That's it, Sandy! You did it!"
Let's see... Yikes! Sweet mother of Pearl!
"Yeah, you could say that. You have to eat as much chum as you can."
Raw!
"One order of chum, please."
"Oh yeah? Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did."
For 30 seconds.
"Ok, Sandy, eat up."
"Sandy, you did it! You survived!  Uh, oh. Hold on, Sandy!  I know just what you need!  A Krabby Patty!"
Oh no! I forgot my camera!
I'll go get the camera.
Oh my.
You bet ya!
"Wow, Sandy! What is all this?"
Here you go.
Ouch!
Say cheese!
Here you go.
Got it! You OK?  Do you smell soup?
Say cheese!
Nice snakes.
Got it! So uh how do you stop?
I said How do you stop?
How do you stop?
"I don't know, Sandy. It is getting kinda dangerous."
Oh my.
That's amazing! Get in front so I can take a picture.
"Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox better go clean it. Now!  I think you broke a record today, Gary. World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww!  I'm worried about Sandy. She's got record-breaking fever!"
You're right. She does need my help. I must stop this madness! It's all that book's fault! The book is evil! The book must be destroyed!
Why don't you take 5? I will hold the book.
"Oh hey, Sandy."
"I came to save you from, from this book. I'm going to destroy it before someone gets killed! I don't wanna lose you, Sandy!  I don't wanna lose you!"
"Um, hurray!"
I thought you left your swim suit at home.
Rotten eggs?!
Who's Craig Mammalton?
"Wow, Patrick, an invitation to our first summer shindig! And here it is!"
It seems to be stuck.
Must be this tan to enter.
"Why, thank you."
"In fact,  it's time for another coat."
"There, now that we've turned your rock into a tanning bed, we're sure to get tan enough for the party! Let's just test it out first to be sure."
"Ooh, Patrick, how do you feel?"
"My turn!  Remember, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly."
"No, no, Patrick, 15 seconds exactly! It's really important...  It's working!  Okay, Patrick, I'm done.  Patrick? Patrick, you there?  Patrick?"
"Uh, Patrick, it's time for me to get out!"
"Well, Patrick, how do I look?"
"What, what, what do you mean?"
I must have been under the tanning machine too long!
"I'll ask Squidward, he's always so helpful. He'll know what to do.  Hi, Squidward."
"Oh, I'm not a ghost, Squidward.  I used Patrick's tanning booth, and I stayed under too long."
"Huh, now I'll never get into that party."
I look... amazing! Time to go to the party!  Oh what a cute wittle baby. Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
"Oh, yeah, that hit the spot."
"Oh, I think you'll have to go to the party without me, Patrick. There's just no way I can get that golden brown in time. But that's no reason you shouldn't go.  Patrick, why did you..."
"No, really, Patrick, what are you...  Ugh. I feel sticky."
"Wooh!  Thanks, Patrick!  Uh, I'm stuck."
"Oh, no! Caramel, hardening! Gotta get out of here!   Patrick? Patrick?"
Can I get a little help here?
"No, Patrick, I..."
"Hey, Patrick. Do you think that maybe too much sun is a bad thing?"
"Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him."
"Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique."
"Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are…  sorry, sold out."
You forgot to buy a ticket?
"Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?"
You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.
I am?
"Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be."
"Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G!"
"You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!"
"Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir."
"Whoa, just look at that lemonade line."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh! Why don't I get one for you?
"It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—"
"Alright. One lemonade, coming up."
Look what I found!
Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand!
"Hey, nice tune.  Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?"
Are you friends with Squidward?
"Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people."
Wow!
"Patrick, what brought you here?"
"It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa—"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience."
Oh! Oh!
SpongeBob SquarePants.
Hey.
Whatcha doing?
How busy would you say you are on a scale of eight to nine?
"Squidward, I'm no mathematologist, but that sounds like a lot!"
"Okay, quick survey. Are you busy busy, or just busy?"
I found a jump rope!
Oh! Who's the lucky...
Somebody like me?
I like openings.
"Come on, jump rope. I guess it's just you and me."
Of course I'll go to the opening with you!
"Oh, he said he had a package for the Widow Duncan. I think he went..."
I'll be your friend.
"It's me, SpongeBob."
Yes? I'm still here.
You don't have to ask me three times.
Oh.
Okey-doke.
Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
"You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you, like this. Wanna play?"
Will do.
Anything for a friend.
"Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!"
"Ah, perfect."
"Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet."
Hi there!
How's it going?
"Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff."
Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!
"Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?"
"Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!"
Cool ice cave!
"No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!"
"Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic."
Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything.
"Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today."
"See ya later, Patrick.  Gary, I'm home!  Boy, this backpack got heavy."
"Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue."
"I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight!"
Ah!
"Good morning, Squidward!"
I do relish...  making the relish!
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?! You called me?"
"Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir!"
"No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!"
Phew.
"But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me!"
"I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent!"
See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!
Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to.
"Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me."
Ooh?  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!
Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?
"Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone."
"Oh, you like that, huh?  Ah!"
"Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!"
"Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!"
Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!
"Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here."
"Right by my side.  Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other.  Let's get them, Patrick."
"I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?"
"Oh, what are you...  Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like!"
"Patrick, look out, behind you!!"
We’ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals!
"We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat."
"Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement."
"Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?"
There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?
"You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!"
Echhh!
"That's okay. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, I said..."
Really?
"Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me."
What are you saying?
"Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you."
But being clean is so much better.
Clean!
Clean!
"Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!"
Ha! Got your nose!
Not until you wash your hands!
"Eww, brain juice!"
"Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me."
Really?
Satisfied?
"You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
"You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!"
"A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  You got to brush in little circles!"
"You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this!"
"Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose."
"Booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!"
"Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon!"
"A Krabby Patty? What are you going to do, eat it?"
"No, not patty socks!"
You better stop that!
You stop that right now!
"Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!"
Try me!
It's too late for that!
I'm covered in muck and scum!
It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!
I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!
And dry-clean my uvula!
"Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean."
"No, Patrick, thank you."
"Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?"
"Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth."
"And what is that, my son?"
"Come, Patrick, my work here is done."
Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
"Oh, dear Neptune."
"We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three.  Spat?"
Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
"WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming, Spat!"
"Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together."
"Thank you, Doctor."
Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!
Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.
OW!
I'm sorry.
"I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?"
How about now?
Now?
Now?
That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
"Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking?  Ooh, breezy today."
"Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny."
"Soon, everyone will know of your beauty."
"All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma."
Anything you want and more.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do."
"No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master."
"Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact..."
"Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job."
"One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?"
"But, but, I thought we were friends."
"Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something."
"Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs."
"I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!"
"You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula."
Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late!
I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
"Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?!"
&#160;: All that glitters is not gold.
"Goodbye, best friend!"
"I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us."
"Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three.  D'oh!"
"Nope.  Oh, wait, now I do."
"Um, just kinda sitting there."
"Still just like kinda sitting there, same thing."
What time is it now?
4 days.
"Patrick, it's moving!"
"Like Mr. Krabs says, it's now or never!"
Usually on his way to the Men's room. Bunsai!
"Patrick, he's taking evasive action."
"I'll fake left, you go right!"
"Other right, Patrick!"
"Ow, I think I ruptured a spleen..."
Your what?
Patrick! There it goes!
"Don't stop now, Patrick, we're gaining on him!"
Ehhh.
"Well, actually Patrick has been trying to shed a few-"
We're really sorry about interrupting your-
Umm...
...specifically.
"Look, Patrick! He's gonna play us a little song."
Short song.
"Challenge? ] Patrick, we don't even have an instrument to play."
Huh! Patrick! Hang on...
"Wouldn't dream of it, Patrick."
"Well, Patrick, even though you won, it looks like he was the real star. Hahaha."
"Patrick, it's a singing competition. What are we gonna do?"
"Hey, give me some of that!"
"Looks like we're on a roll, eh, Patrick?"
My compliments to the chef.
"Hah! Well, actually, my friend and I, we don't like to wrestle."
"No, we're not the wrestling sort."
"Well, uh-uh, we like to go jellyfishing!"
"Well, it goes something like this:"
"Now, Patrick!  Well, something like that anyway..."
"Well, I guess if I were to say one thing, and I think I'm speaking for Patrick and myself here, is that y'all are a bunch a' real kind folks and it's been a real hoot gettin' to know y'all!  Farewall, friendly trenchbillies. See ya' 'round."
Over to home.
For the rest of our natural-born lives?!
"Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!"
"Oh please, Mr. Trenchbillie, where can we-"
Mr. Krabs! We just escaped from an angry mob of deep sea bunkins!
Because they followed us here.
"Aye', captain! I'm gonna get some more buns."
"♪Oh, it's drawing very near. My favorite time of the year.  The snow is falling and the cold wind blows.  Christmas is almost here.  And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me!  It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little...  Eyes on me.♪"
"Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today?"
"Okay...  ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!♪  Ooh, what's that?"
Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats?
"♪Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee!  And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?♪"
"Merry Christmas, Sandy!"
"♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me.♪ Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas?"
Don't you mean the season of giving?
"Hey, Plankton! What've you got there?  Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya?"
Ooh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot!  Wow! This is great!
No.
Mm-mm.
No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious!
Don't mind if I do!
No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer?
Well...  I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!
"Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat?"
Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in!
I knew you'd like it.
Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
"Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy.  Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”!"
"Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché.  Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!"
"Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake."
Have some fruitcake!
"Merry Christmas, fellas!"
"Gee. That wasn't very nice.  Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!"
"What's that all about?  Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?"
"Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters."
"Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will."
"More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help.  Squidward!"
"Oh gosh, what do I do now?"
"Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home."
"Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why."
"Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem."
"Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own.  Whoa!"
"What is it, Sandy?"
"From Plankton, he baked it."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
"Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song!  Sandy, The song is the antidote!"
"Ahoy, everybody!"
"♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!  Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas! When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪"
"♪Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!♪"
And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute.
"Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!"
"Oh, no!"
Naughty list?!
But---!
"But- but- but- but- but- but---!  But, Santa, you've got it all wrong!"
"If you want Santa, you gotta get through me!"
Is that all you got?
"You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter!  Hot from the oven, full of lovin'!  Hurry up, Santa, hop on!"
"Oh, it was nothing."
"Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?"
Oh! It's cartoon time! I'll get our Sir Urchin hats.  Whoa.
"It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library."
A library is a...playground for your mind.
"Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?"
"Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly.  Ow!  Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell."
"Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous."
"There are logbooks,  unabridged books,  and books with bridges."
Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks.  I can hear the ocean.
"Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious."
"Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack!  It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book.  Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick."
"To continue the story, you have to turn the page."
Then feast your eyes!
"He likes it! Hey, Patrick!"
"Ooh, Patrick, your head is absorbing all the book knowledge just like a sponge!"
"Go, Patrick! Get those words! Get them good!"
"Wow, what a bookworm!  Whoa."
"Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full."
"Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream."
"Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!"
"Eh, wha what?"
I got it.
"Little bit...  Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?"
"Okay, sure. Let's give it a try.  Gary! Speak to me. Oh...  Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere.  Slime! That's it!  Slime it up, Gar-bear."
"Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out."
Hey. Head Shrinking for Beginners.  Hm...
"Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary."
You'll need to dumb down to get free!
"All right, Patrick! Let's get stupid! Yeah!"
Electronics.
Whew. I hope this works.
"We've got drool! Patrick, it's working!"
"We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!"
"Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella."
"Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?"
"That's right, Patrick.  Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh?"
"Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway."
Patrick!
Patrick!
Patrick!  The road!  Patrick! What are we gonna do?
"Sit tight, Patrick! I'm coming to get you!  No!"
"Hey, Patrick.  Patrick! Call me!"
SquarePants residence.
Hmmmm... have we ever dug a tunnel between our two houses?
Patrick?
Tag! You're it!
Tag! You're it!
Peek-a-boo! I see you!
You're it!
Who's there?
"Ohh... Patrick, check out these roots!"
"Do like the roots do, and do the Dirt Dance, baby!"
Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy.
It ate Squidward!
Yeah! We're reprobates!
"You told us not to walk on your yard, so we walked under it."
Somebody wants to play Tag!
Not it!
Squidward wins!
Oh boy!
"Hi, Squidward"
Yuh oh!
Must dig! Ohhh! The rock's too hard!
"Ahhhh.  Good morning, Squidward! Another beautiful day under Bikini Bottom!"
"Good morning, Gary!"
"A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day."
"Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab."
"Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready."
"But I don't have time to wait in line. Sorry, but I can't be late today."
"Sorry, everyone, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir."
"Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward."
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs."
"Yes, Sir?"
"Oh, but Mr. Krabs."
I thought you said that I would be in charge of decorations.
I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!
Wow! Fifty cents!
Yee-haw!
You come here often?
There we go.
"Your change, sir."
"Every word, Squidward, every word."
"Yes! Yeah! Ooh, I almost forgot. Mr. Krabs, wait! There's one last decoration!  I present to you...   I present to you...  ... my ode to the Krabby Patty  made entirely out of ice."
"Ready? Set?  Guys, I'm okay. No need to scream."
"Oh, no. Patrick, stand up!  We're locked in!  This is gonna spoil the eleventy-seventh anniversary."
How do we get out?
"Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized."
"Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts."
Don't worry Squidward. We'll find a way out and then we'll have the best eleventy-seventh anniversary ever. All we have to do is stick together.
Oh. My house is on TV.
"Gary the snail, you get down from that bed this instant."
"Look, it's Sandy!"
"Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Dental hygiene is very, very important."
"I think it's us, Patrick.  But, who are they&#160;?"
"That might just be my hand, Mr. Krabs."
Lead them? I can finally  use my leader hat...  and my lederhosen.
Follow me!
"Guys, its a dead end."
"Plankton,  you're trying to steal the Krabby Patty recipe again."
"You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories."
"Well, okay. Mr. Krabs called me into his office."
You mean?
"We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned close and whispered the recipe."
"But, Squidward, you're glad I moved in. Remember that day.  ah-uh.  Nah.  No."
"It's beautiful.  I'll take it.   Hi, neighbor!  I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.  And we're going to be bestest friends.  Hey Patrick. Guess, who just moved in right next door?"
Oh. If only Sandy were here. She could help us.
Remember the day Sandy and I got married?
Mm-hmm.
I do.
"♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪"
Ready!
"Yeah!  Hello, Krusty Krab!  ♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪"
"♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪"
I'm ready!
Ready!
"Well, hello.  Are you okay?  Mister?"
We didn't even get to celebrate the Krusty Krab's eleventy-seventh anniversary. We missed what could have been the greatest party ever!
"No, Patrick, I don't want to give up."
"Guys, we can't give up now. We got into this mess together, and we'll get out of it the same way."
No. By using our heads.
No.  As a battering ram.  Hup.
Okay. This is the one. Feel very good about this. Okay. Ready?
"Oh, it was not for nothing, Squidward. I spent the whole day with my best friends.   You, Squidward.  And you Patrick."
And let's not forget the man who made it all possible. Mr. Krabs. What could be better?

It's coming back!
"Patrick, let go of that pie!  Bad Patrick, bad!  Yah!"
Take this instead
"Wow! In Surface Land, everywhere you go is full of surprises!"
"Best birthday ride ever!  I've read about this place, Patrick. It's the Paperclip Jungle!"

I love this guy!

No!

"Uh,  I'm just gonna head back to my seat."
"Wait, Rube! We can't leave all these fish behind!"
Ooh!  Whee!
Did you see that?
"Good-bye, sweet Surface Land. I'll never forget you."
"You were right, Rube, that was..."
"Well, how about now?"
Nice try! Maybe next year!
"Well, of course I'm here. Great job with your walker! You walked really far."
"Why don't we just let Old Man Walker get home, Patrick?"
I hope I'm that spry when I'm his age.  Huh. Must have forgotten to take my keys.
A surprise party? For me?
"Oh, thank you, everybody. You've made this the best birthday I ever had. My spongy heart is bursting with joy 'cause I know I have the love of my pet, Gary..."

Hi Patrick. Where's your sleigh?
Hop in. We'll give you a lift.  Come on Gary!
Squidward! Buddy!  He doesn't look so hot. We better take him with us.
"Patrick, do you hear that?"
"No problem, right, Gare?"
Hi Mr. Krabs.
"Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!"
This is a dead end!
Hey! How about a campfire song?
Gary!
What is that formidable creature?
I thought that was just a myth.
"Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!"
"Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale."
Hm? Oh! Ew.
"Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!"

"Attaboy, Gary!"

"Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--...land?"
The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach.
"Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch."
"No, we're not!  Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body."
Mr. Krabs!
No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!
"Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?"
Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
Hooray! We made it.
Perhaps over there..

It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working.

"Mr. Krabs, you didn't... forget... to pay the power bill again, did you?"
What?
"Oh, that noise was Sandy."
"Aloha, Patrick!"
"Ha, ha, ha! That's a good one Patrick: on-board! Whoa!"
Patrick! Look out!
Just dragging it around.
Huh?
Island?
We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?
How did you guys get here?
Why do they call you Twitch?
Never mind.
So what did you say this house is made from again?
"Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon."
O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom?  Aaaaahhhhhh!  I don't know how to surf!
Cool!
"Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?"
Down here!  See? It's a picture of Squidward!
What's he saying?
Who?
"Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch."
How far up stream did you say it was?
Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys! I found the Cove!
"Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here."
You've got to stop judging people by the way they look.

"Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home?"
"I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?"
"Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?"
"Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson."
Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
Yup.
"He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed."

"Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye."
"Keep paddling, Patrick!"
It's... the Big One!
"Patrick, grab on!"
"Hang on, Squidward! This is it!"
Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
Mr. Krabs! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
JKL!
No!
"Hey, Twitch!"
JKL!
"Turn it up, Chip!"
"You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!"
"Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!"
Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!
"Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever."
"Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloy netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world."
"Good night, Patrick."
"Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!"
"Oh, right. Pants."
"Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!"
"Put one over there, Patrick."
Maybe we should spread out a little.
"Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return."
12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.
Oh! Hello? Hello?
"Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!"
"No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net."
Hello?!
"What?! Really, Patrick?"
"Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever."
"Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday."
"No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?"
"Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present."
It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
"Patrick, we need to talk."
"Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?"
Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.
"What's in your hand, Patrick?"
What's in your other hand?
"Well, I gotta go."
Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he?
"Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.  Good morning, Patrick."
"What are you going to do today, buddy?"
"Well, I'm off to work. See ya later, Patrick."
"Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants."
"Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go?"
"Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?"
"I don't have any binoculars, see?"
I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird!  You're... acting... weird!
"Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean."
Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.
"Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net.  I will pay one billion dollars for that net."
"Oh, really?"
And why not?
A-ha!
"Patrick,  I'm the scary mustache guy!"
Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?!
"You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!"
Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!
What?
For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you! Patrick?
"What'cha doing, best friend?"
Where are you going?
"Patrick, no!  So, this is it?"
"Patrick, don't go! I'm sorry I accused you! It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me."
Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?
"Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by."
"Oh, come here, you big lug!"
So did I.  My best friend made it for me.
"Hi, mailman!"
"Okay,  see you tomorrow!"
"Let's see...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!"
"That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest."
Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
"This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!"
"Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?"
What kind of things?
"That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!"
"Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?"
"No, something real, an item, something you would pay for."
"That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!"
"Fancy living, here we come!"
"Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead."
"Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some  chocolate?"
"Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step!  Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?"
"Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!"
Wow... what is it?
Let's try next door!
"Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?"
We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
"One chocolate bar, coming up!"
I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice—
"—lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic."
"No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?"
That's it! He made us feel special!
"No, wait, Patrick!"
Why don't we try being nice?
"Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good."
"I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try."
"Um,  H-H-How you doin'?"
Wanna buy some chocolate?
We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.
Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Let's shake on it.
"Remember, Patrick, focus."
"Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars."
I can't understand what were doing wrong.
"There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!"
They are most certainly not delicious!
Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
"That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!"
"We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!"
"Hello, young lady."
We're selling chocolate.  Is your mother home?
"Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for..."
"If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!"
It'll make your hair grow.
They'll make you sound smart.
They'll make you fly!
They'll bring world peace!
You'll rule the world!
"Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!"
"Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation."
"Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding."
"Quick, Patrick, let's help him!"
"Careful, put him down gently."
"Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?"
"Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to."
"Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures."
Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Thank you for your patronage.
"Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money."
"So, how long have you two ladies known each other?"
"Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪  ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪  ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants."
"I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine!"
"That, Patrick, is a flying machine."
What's so funny?
"Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff!"
Don't remind me.
"Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?"
"It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh!"
"This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! Behold."
"No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board."
"Patrick, get ready to say Eureka!"
Go!  It's working! I'm flying!
"Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite."
"Local nutcase tries to fly?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!"
You'll see.
"Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!"
Huh?
"Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon."
"There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality."
"No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Mama? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!"
♪I'm flying. I'm flying!♪
"♪They laughed, they scoffed, before I had liftoff.♪"
♪I'd love to hang around to say I told you so.♪  ♪But it's off to Jellyfish Fields I go!♪  ♪Roads and streets are not for me.♪
"Gotcha!  Next time, try the elevator."
♪I have never felt so free!♪  ♪High in the sky is the place for me.♪  ♪Helping friends from up above.♪  ♪These are the things that I love!♪  ♪I'll help Mr. Krabs reclaim his dime.♪
♪And I'll save Patrick from this mime!♪
"♪Even Plankton needs some help, when he gets tangled in the ke-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-elllllllp!♪"
I'm coming!
That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish.
"But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality."
"Let's roll!  Where to, Mr. K?"
"You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?"
I think my pants can handle it.
Yes?
Clean up crime?
That's your emergency?
"All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs."
"Aw, shrimp.  Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!"
Patrick's in trouble.
"What is it, buddy?"
"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are."
Dennis?
"If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish."
I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it!
"Well, it was fun while it lasted.  I guess I'm not meant to fly after all.  Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show...  ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪  ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪  ♪Kites are made for windy days. Lawn chair with balloons... fly away♪  ♪Inflatable pants... you may as well skip!♪  ♪If you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. Yeah.♪  Goodbye, jellies! You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was."
"No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish."
Did Patrick just...?  Nah!
"I'm down here, sir."
Squidward said I could help by burying myself.
Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me!
"It's almost on, Gary."
"Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history."
"Look, Gary! It's on!"
"THERE I AM, GARY, THERE I AM!"
"LOOK, GARY, THERE I AM AGAIN, LOOK!"
"That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed.  Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place."
"Top of the morning, oldster."
You did?
"You're right! Wow, he recognized me."
"Weren't you that guy on TV? Yes! I am that guy.  How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I..."
"Oh, please excuse me, sir."
"Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for...  Why, sir, I'm flattered."
You're on your way.
"Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?"
"F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him."
"No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy."
"Yes, I am that guy on TV."
"Please, good people, no photos at work."
"Well, maybe just one.  Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it."
"Yes, pilot."
"I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful."
Solo record!
"They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby."
"Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now."
"Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person! We're on the same page here, aren't we?"
"I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm outta here."
"Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast."
"No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment."
"How you doing, folks?"
"That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy!"
"I'd like to call this little number Striped Sweater. ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing...♪"
"♪That one... special... sweater...♪  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable."
"Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy."
They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.
"Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!"
"Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer."
"Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!"
"Noooooooooo!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted."
"They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks."
You like that?
"It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?"
I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
Ready for the grand finale?
I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.
Mm-hmm.
Ah.
Mm?
Oh!
I'll get it!
"Aww, what sweet little angels!"
"Don't worry your pretty little head, little lady. I'll watch the gals until you're done!"
"Yeah, I think I know a little something about babysitting, Sandy."
Excuse me.
"Story time!  Goldyfish and the Three Sea Bears. Chapter one, breaking and entering."
"Now you girls go easy on me, okay?"
Ow!
Great idea!  I'll take them to the funnest place in all of Bikini Bottom!
"The Krusty Krab!  Mr. Krabs, these are Sandy's little nieces."
"This is my coworker-slash-best buddy, Squidward."
Here you go! Three Dolly Patties.
Huh! Guess that's me all over.
"Aww, what cute little knuckles you have. Hmm, hmm... ooh, I've got just the spot."
"Ahh, smell that fresh seawater."
"Oh, heh-hey, right. Sorry."
"See, Sandy, nothing to worry about. Baby-sitting is eaaaaasy."
Huh?
Hm?
"Well, isn't that sweet!"
"Concrete, what?!  Good structural integrity girls, but a little tight!"
Wrecking what?!
Let's all go to my house and take a little break.
"Here we are, girls. Pineapple, sweet pine—  Whoa!"
"Patrick, you could have watched it while I was out."
Boop. There you go.
"Yeah. Patrick, meet Sandy's nieces."
"Ah, finally, I can relax.  With work!"
Who wants brownies?  Heh. I'll go make another batch.
Ooh! I'll have to make more brownies!
"Ready, set...wrassle!"
"Oh, sorry, Sandy.  I guess I'm just not a very good babysitter."
What's that?
"Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally."
"Like what, Mr. Krabs?"
At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
"Well, I could try.  Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete."
Maybe Pete is just tired.
"Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs.  I guess it might affect his productivity-"
"Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!"
Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
"See, look! He's already perking up!"
Definitely!
"Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started."
Here's one!
Going long!
Is this far enough?
"Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs.  Ahh. Here, let me try!"
"Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy."
"Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic."
Aww!
Aww!
A real disk?
Well. Eh.
"Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic."
"Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?"
Aww!
Yum.
"Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs."
"Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?"
You want me to paint your face?
"Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost."
Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
No. Course not.
"Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!"
"100% sure, Mr. Krabs!"
Whoo!  Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
It's a paper plate. Whoo!
"Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me."
"Ahem! Hello, Plankton!"
"Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!"
"Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!"
No!
Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
"I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs."
The greatest company picnic ever!
"Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!"
Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!"
"Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh."
"Uhh, Patrick..."
"Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants."
"But, but..."
Like?
"Actually, I've got two."
"Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!"
I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
How you feeling?
I'm ready.
May the best man win.
"I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge."
Once upon a time...
Perfect!
1]
"So, uhh, what do you think?"
What's so funny?
"You mean, Patrick can't come?"
And my friends?
"I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too."
I... I...  I don't wanna go!
"Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!"
"Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?"
"What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?"
Gary! What are you doing!?
"Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!"
"There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!"
"What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company!"
"Is something wrong, Patrick?"
What's what?
"P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?"
Good idea!
Yeah?
What makes you say that?
"Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?"
"Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  Itch!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind!  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching!"
"Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!"
All what-y?
"Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all!"
Help… Me!
"What's going on, Squidward? Help!"
Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home!
"Where's my snail, Gary?"
Gary? Whoa!
Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!
"Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!"
Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.
"There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh? Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work!"
"Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir."
Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!  NOOOOO!
Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?
"Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
"Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!"
We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.
"Okay, how are we on snacks?"
Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures?  Check. Drapes?
Lampshade?
"Thermometer?  Check. Ukulele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?"
And...
"It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have..."
No...  NO!  No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now?
Squidward! Squidward! Let us in! We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!
"Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward."
"I don't know, Patrick. All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind.  Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick."
"We made it!  Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair!"
"Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!"
"So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?"
"Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started."
"Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?"
"Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together."
"Oh, this is it!"
"Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!"
So superhero awesome!
"Sorry, Patrick. We're all out."
Patrick!
Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.
Uh-huh.
We come here every morning.
Uh-huh.
"Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book.  Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter.  What's wrong, Squidward?"
"Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave."
Squidward?
"Uh, Squidward?"
"Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward."
"Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party."
"Oh, this is so neat."
Let's do it again.
But--
"You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us."
"Yeah, they're pretty adorable."
"Oh, yeah."
"Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?"
"No, no. I mean he seems happier."
"Squidward, what are you doing here?"
"Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward.  I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly.  The new Squidward sure is helpful.  Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic.  Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy.  Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us."
S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
"What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh--  --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!"
"Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?"
"Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it."
"Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them."
But he's not a real fry cook.
"Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
What's wrong with it?
Dimples? It was him! New Squidward did it.
The guy you're looking for is over there.
Yes?
Mm-hmm?
Employee of the Month]
Okay.
"It's okay, Squidward.  It's a very okay cake."
"Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you?  Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend?  Pogo-dancing with your best friend?!  Stop!  Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy  but me!  Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub!  You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world  I know. I'll go apologize. Come on.  Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there."
"Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal."
What are you talking about?
"Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!"
What is it?
"Wow, what are you gonna do with it?"
The moon! Can I go?
"But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy."
"Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?"
"Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!"
"Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?"
"YEAH!!! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!"
"Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?"
"Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting."
"Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!"
"Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick."
"What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?"
A present?
"There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy."
"Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!"
"It's pretty impressive, all right."
"We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!"
"We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows."
"Yeah, just don't touch anything."
"Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?"
"Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?"
"Patrick, I don't think we should..."
"No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go."
"Stop, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here. And I happen to know that that particular button is riiight over here."
Look!  We're in space now! Wee!
"Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!"
We must be landing.
"Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick."
"Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!"
"Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!"
"Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them. Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis."
"Patrick, do you know what this thing is?"
No. It's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo.
Let's capture the little phony!
We don't want your money... moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
"Well, there's plenty more where those came from."
There's no time for that! Just push harder.
"Nice try, Sandy."
"It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!"
"Yeah? Well, I got you now."
"Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh..."
Hooray!
"What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?"
Retiring?
I sure am.
"Have fun, Mr. Krabs."
New manager?
Krabby O'Monday’s?
Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
"I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would."
"Aye aye, sir."
Aye aye... Eugene.
Where's the love?
I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat.
Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
...despair.
"No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over...  this way.  Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?"
Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob.
"Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?"
"We've got a  love emergency!  Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency!  Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do. You need to give her a present from  in here."
"No, from the heart. That's where your love grows."
Your love.
Love.
Luh...vuh!
Say it with me. L...
...uhh...
...vvvv...
Llll...uhhh...vuh!
"That's it! You've taken your first steps into the hall of luh-uv. Now, tell me more about your Karen"
"So, what's your favorite thing for you and Karen to do together?"
"Trampling enemies.  Now, tell me about Karen."
Does she have any hobbies?
Interesting. Does she ever go Ding!?
Ooh. A music lover. I think we have our solution. You need to serenade her.
"Not to worry. When you finish, you'll be as  golden voiced as me."
Repeat after me. ♪Me me me me me me meeeee...♪
"Oh, you are ready!"
"Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside."
"This is it, Plankton."
"Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy."
"Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you.  Ah, love."
They're such a lovely couple.  The Krabby Patty Formula?!?
"Oh, no! I've got to stop it before it's too late."
"Control, Alt, Delete."
How do ya turn this thing off?!?
"The plug.  Ha! You lose, Plankton."
I am so fired.
No!
"Yes! I'm saved! Your wife exploded!   Um...happy anniversary, you guys."
"Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become..."
Heave-ho!
But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
Patrick?
Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
"Patrick, we're not getting paid at all."
"Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff."
"First, we need to set up the tarp."
"We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about!  Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now."
"And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off."
"Patrick, the lid's already off."
"I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick."
"Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go..."
...Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall!
...I'm getting to the painting...
No problem. Here I go.  Yeah. Huh?  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?
Noooooo!!  Patrick?
I don't think this bubble can get much bigger.
"Pat, no!!  We did it!  We painted the whole house! And without getting a drop of paint on anything but th--  FLAPPIN' FLOTSAM, WHAT'S THAT!?!?!?!?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?"
That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
"Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it."
"This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon! And when he sees what we did to his first dollar…"
But Mr. Krabs said...
Did it work?
Did it work?
Did it work?
Nothing's working!
It didn't work.
"Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet."
"Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick!! No!  PATRICK, NO! WHY DID YOU PUT IT...  AHH! GRAB IT, PAT, GRAB IT! HURRY, HURRY! I...  Aww, Pat, no, no!  GET IT, PAT! GET IT! GET IT, GET IT!  No-o-o-o-oh!"
"Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!"
"Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!"
"We're all done, sir. Everything looks great."
"Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going..."
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!"
"It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!"
"Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, you know, just hanging around."
"No, No, Mr. Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!"
"We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
You mean our butts?
"Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!"
"Oh, Mrs. Puff?"
Mrs. Puff!?
I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?
Help!
Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!
Mrs. Puff!
"It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?"
So what do you think?
"Oh, boy! I get to show you the ropes, Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now."
Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?
"Eager to get behind the wheel, eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!"
Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember: Good Grades.
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh, yes! The total key is a bit sticky, so you're gonna have to be forceful, but not too forceful. Get it?"
"You did! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm?"
"Good day, ma lady, charmed, I'm sure."
"Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day."
"Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as duke."
"Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast."
"Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!"
Yes!
"Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook."
"Oh, Mrs. Puff."
It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity.
"One Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?"
"I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although, a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far, student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P, look out for the barrel!"
"Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go, Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though."
Don't forget to read the note!
"Good day, class!"
"Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob."
Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1.
"Hurry, Patrick, hurry!  How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?"
"Okay, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece."
"Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo."
"No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble."
"Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate.  ♪The sun must set at the end of every day.♪  ♪And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.♪  ♪And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.♪"
♪I will try again...♪
♪...To blow a bubble...♪
♪...That will last all day.♪
"Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!"
Huh?  What have I done!?  We're never gonna get out of here!
"That's what happened, Patrick."
"Antis, what do think that means, Patrick?"
"My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!"
We were just...
"No. Squidward, we'd never..."
What's an Atlantean omelet?
Why is this bubble painted on the mural?
"The oldest living bubble, alive!  Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!"
"Hoo hoo, yeah, hoo hoo hoo!"
"Ah, so this is what luxury feels like."
"No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪  ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪   Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪  ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪"
Pretty!
"Ring for the king, huh?"
My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
Mr. Krabs?
"Patrick, shhh!"
"No, sir."
Comb flavored.
"Hey, cool."
Someone help me!
"Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!"
Quite.
"Oh, oh, I know, I know!"
It looks like my front door!
Whoa!
"Okay. Bye, Squidward!"
"Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now?"
There it is Patrick!
"Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!"
"Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness, sir.  Just look at it, Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look.  Patrick! Get the--"
"Whoo, that was a close one buddy!"
"Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen."
"Great idea, Patrick!"
"Patrick, did you hear something?"
Mmm-hmm.
We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!
We have to go home now!
"Because, uh, Gary misses me?"
"It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!"
That tickles!
"Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants.  Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino."
"It's not gone, if you believe."
So long. And thanks for the tour.
"♪Goodbye, Atlantis. But we really have to go. Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh! Back to Bikini Bottom! I can hardly wait!♪"
♪I love Bikini Bottom! It's where my Gary is!♪
♪Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab. Where I'm happily employed!♪

You called Mr. Krabs?
Yes! Please!
La la la la la la la la la!
🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man!  Hey travel buddies!
Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
I will happily honor this family tradition.
Ow!
"Um, is time to come up yet?"
"Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?"
Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
Bathroom! Bathroom!
Not really.
Bill?
"Yeah, I...  ...sure did sir!"
"Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is staring at us.  Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!"
Uh oh! I thought this might happen!
Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us!
"We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs?  Gasp!   Mr. Krabs!"
"I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change!  Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH!  Watch out, Mr. Krabs!"
Phew... that was close.
"It's okay, sir. I'm sure I..."
Wah oh!
"Mr. Krabs! It's okay!  The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See?"
Yay!
That didn't work at all!
"You, too, sir!"
Wow! It's-
Oh no...
Wait! I have an idea!
"Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely."
Community!
"See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing."
Let's see what other nice people are saying.
Nothing! I just love to shriek!
"Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected."
"Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted."
"Huh? Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted. Signed, Guybesideu3?"
"Huh?  Dumb-blurted! LOL!?, What's the Point?, I could make a better patty out of mud?! Where are all these notes coming from?"
If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
"Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em."
"No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here."
"No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here."
Now it's smaller than that one!
"Hey, Squidward!"
Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
"Well, why didn't you tell me?"
"That's for me! Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139! Cordially, P-Star7."
"Oh, why did you have to say that?"
"You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!"
It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
Yeah.
He said that?!
"Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold."
You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
"People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!"
"Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message."
A lesson in polite manners.
"We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!"
"Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy."
"Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower."
So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
"Surprise, P-Star7!"
"Patrick, you're P-Star7?"
"So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth."
"You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along."
Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn?
"Yeah.  Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front."
"Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob."
"Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB.  We'll be daily pallies!"
Whoops.  Back to work!
"Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble?"
"Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?"
What did you do with DB?
"DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?"
"Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free!"
"Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB.  I will clean them for you. Taupe sweet, mon ami."
Zut alors!  DB?  Incoming!
"Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!"
"Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!"
Uh-oh.
"Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!"
"It's on, now!"
"Help, help, call the cops, call Mr. Krabs, call my mommy!"
Not Goo Lagoon!
"Thank you, my beloved pet Gary, thank you, my big pineapple, and my toolshed, and my mailbox, and Patrick!  Uh, what? Wow. Sometimes I just forget how absorbent I am."
"Aww, little mini DB is so cute!"
"Every time I wash dishes, I will think of you."
"It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it."
Just kidding!
Thank you!  You got some schmutz under there.
Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!
No new spatulas?
Right!
"Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!"
"Hello, pole."
What's in the box?
I like surprises.
I'm ready!
"Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!"
"Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!"
A stick in the sand.
Me? Really?
"Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here."
I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
The King Krab?
The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!
"You're right, too scary."
"Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl."
"Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter."
Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.
But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
"All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw."
Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?
Uh... right on.
Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
"This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?"
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem."
"Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news."
"Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!"
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way."
What's it?
"That's not what I said, sir."
"Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?"
"How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes."
"Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!"
I got it! I can pretend to  fire you. I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
Stop trying to break me in half?
"Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl, I need to have a word with you!"
"It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that..."
"Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if..."
"Pearl, you're fired."
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!"
"There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy."
She's off to bigger and better things.
"Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!"
"Um, Plankton was small and... And green and loud!"
Plankton's alive? Hooray!
"I know I've said this 90 times already but... ♪I love Krabby Patties I think that they are swell. They are the best, there's no contest, and now I'm going to yell.♪ Whew!  ♪I love Krabby Patties!

♪La la la la laaaaaaa... la la la la!♪
"♪Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... I like Krabby Patties! I think they're swell.  I like Krabby Patties, can you not tell?  Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties.  They're so neat.  La la la la la. Sweet to eat.  La la la la la. Really neat. Sweet to eat.  Treat that's neat.  Sweet treat sweet treat.  La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪"
"Actually, ma'am,  it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure."
Ooh! Okay.
"Uh, 4 days."
"You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly."
"Mr. Krabs, I-"
"Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-"
"Yeah, but...this  my home."
"Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today!"
"Patrick, that bag is totally empty."
"If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?"
But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?
Nooooooo!
Ms. Gristlepuss! Look out!
Your shoe's untied!
♪La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪  Really neat.
♪Treat that's neat!♪
♪Aaaaaaannndddd...♪  ♪dismount!♪
Does that mean you're not sending us to the slammer?
Don't forget the spatula!
"Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha..."
"Sandy?  Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?"
"Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray."
"Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?"
What is this stuff?
"Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful!"
Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!
I guess you're right. It's okay here!
I think it came from Sandy's tree.
Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed!
I think this thing is Sandy.
"She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan."
"Oooh, you better run faster, Sandy!"
"Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!"
"Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore."
Ha! That is really disturbing!
Huh?
Sandy! NO! STOP!
"Sandy, it's us, your friends, SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her."
"All right, Pat!"
"Well, that oughta work."
"Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!"
"See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!"
They couldn't afford station wagons either!
"All right, Pinhead. Your time is up!"
What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?
I'd say I'm Dirty Dan.
Ow!  I'd say I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
I'm Dirty Dan! Oof!
I'm Dirty Dan! D'oh!
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
I'm Dirty Dan! Ow!
AAAAAAAHHH!
Patrick!
"Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya!  Okay, I warned ya!"
Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again!
"Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!"
Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.
N-n-n-no.
I'm so cold...  that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks.
Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!
"The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"
Maybe...
Maybe it's her fur!
"Look at all that warm, toasty fur."
Carefully...carefully?
"All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right?"
"Well, I guess I've lived a full life!"
"Pat, no!  Pat, are you crazy?!"
Let me see that roll of tape.
And this eyebrow-goatee-combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
"I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!"
...Spring?
Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
"It's okay, Sandy.  Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals!"
"Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered."
"Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see now. Dear SpongeBob..."
"Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!"
"♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends."
You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.
"So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!"
"Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  Oh no! You don't think he p-p-p-p-popped in there ...?!"
"Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha!"
"Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!"
"Shiny, no!"
"Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window!"
"I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you."
"Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye!"
"Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son."
"Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble."
"Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!"
"Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you."
"Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry."
"Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer."
"There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt."
"That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the let's do nothing at all game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-"
Shiny? Shiny where are you?
"Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get you to my house and keep you away from sharp pointy things."
"Oh, tartar sauce. Oooh!"
"Bikini Bottom Pin Factory?! Shiny, no! I'll save you!  You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose."
"Where's Shiny? Oh, no!  Scissor Works? I'll save you, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed!"
"Shiny?  Pitchfork Pantry. Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace safe for you to visit. Ah, that's it. The Pillow Foundry. You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?"
"Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house."
"Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know!"
"Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, now!  Phew, he's okay."
Uh-oh.
"Oh, he's...  ...doing great."
Again?
"Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil, sort of way."
"Bye-bye. Anytime you need a babysitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy."
"Hey, yah!"
"Whoa! Hup.  There, there. You're safe now, little lady."
"So, we meet again, Crazyfish!"
With pleasure!
"You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!"
"Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting.  Hey, that's cheating!"
"Yes, it is!"
"Yes, it is!"
Is too!
Is too!
Is too!
Is not!
Is not!
"Don't worry! I'm ready!  Bring it on!  Oh, good morning, Gare-bear."
I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?
"No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature.  Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black...  ...eye."
"Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!"
I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
"You promise you won't laugh?  Okay, here goes.  Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste.  Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd...  Gare...?"
"No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson."
"Hmm...  Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall."
"He was big and mean. Oh, but old SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners."
I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
"Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him."
"I woke up... Oh, I mean, I..."
"That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy."
"Slugger, that's me.  What the?"
"Hi, Sandy."
Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need them. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
"Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget."
"No, I engraved it on his pain gland."
"Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!"
"It all happened late last night...  I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head.  Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps.  He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage."
"Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner."
"Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios!"
"Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking."
That's right.
"Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it.  All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye."
"All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?"
"Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum."
"Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  Don't worry, I'll save you. I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!"
"Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache..."
"I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real..."
"Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember."
"Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walking, like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?"
"One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry."
No!
I'm ready! I'm ready!
Awwww. I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Hey! Spring-boob Squire-pin stole my idea!
"WHAHOO!  Oh, I wonder when my  prize will...  get here...  My prize!  Can it be? It is!  The conch signal!!  From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy,  as seen on TV!  I wonder if it still works?"
Hmm.  Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore.
"I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home."
"Excuse me, I'm..."
"Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir."
Don't worry. There's no danger.
I won it in a contest.
"Yes, sirs!"
"Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies."
Help... Can't...  open mayonnaise!
But...
"I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!"
Oh...
"Hey,  can I drive?"
Tons! Like the windshield wipers are right here.
Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!
"You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder!"
You said he could snap...  ...just like that!
"I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow."
Okay.
It doesn't seem to be here.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked.  But I can't let my heroes down!"
I found it and it's the special dance mix!
Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!!
You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain! Can I get your autograph?
I am?
Oh...
"I sure would, Squidward. That sounds..."
"Oh, yeah!"
You can say that again!
She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!
"Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!"
No! don't tell me! I can't take it!
"No, please. Just... just don't."
Two weeks? I'll never make it.
"Good morning, Nurse Rechid.  Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you."
"Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time."
"Hiya, Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back."
"It has been two weeks already? . Don't worry, doc. I promise to stay out of the way."
"Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!"
Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera?
"Very well, doctor. Carry on."
Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!
"You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!"
Wait!
I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before.
Yeah?
Great Neptune...
Handsome. But she spelled it wrong.
"Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!"
"Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before."
If that's even possible.
"Well, I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome."
Hmmm... I know just what to do.
"I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose."
"Well, okay..."
"Just remember, Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you."
"Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again.  Nope. Still too handsome.  It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough."
"Eeee! Squidward, you're even more handsome now!  And the crowd is in a frenzy."
"I know, Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just need..."
Squidward! Look out for that falling shoe!
Squidward...
"You're back! Oh, Squidward...I love you no matter how many times we smash your face."
"Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!"
"But it's not Tuesday, Patrick."
Now what?
Okay... ready!
"I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember, Patrick, finders keepers."
"Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious."
"Get off him, Patrick!"
But he still feels cold.
Do you think he'll be okay?
I don't know.
"No, no, that part goes here."
We're almost there. We can do this.
"This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!"
"I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!"
"No, stay back!"
It was an accident!
"Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!"
We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!
Does that include...
Here?
Here?
Here?
Too tired...
"Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness."
Art thou not pleased?
"Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it."
Flank steak.
But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
I can't do it!
"Patrick, are you ready for this?"
"Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming?"
"Patrick, it's this way."
Here.
It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!
"Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?"
No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.
Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
We're going to put you to rest.
Yeah.
"Okay, get in."
But you said we could put you to rest.
"I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but he...  Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?"
"Oh, look, the mourners have arrived."
"No, just into this hole."
You're bald?
But-
"Go home.  But I, Master--"
"As you wish, master."
"No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever."
"Patrick, say that again."
"No, the other thing."
"No, what you said before when you..."
Never mind! I've got an idea.
I can't reach him!
Isn't he beautiful?
"All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend!"
He's on the other side now.
"Order up, Squidward!"
"Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator."
"Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah."
"I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?"
Eyelashes!
"Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears."
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."
"Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala."
"Here's your order, sir."
Yes?
"Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two..."
What's the part two?
"Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list."
"The things that are extra fun, I've written in red."
"Yeah, I know."
"Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you."
"Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward."
"Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity."
I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
"That's a good one Squidward!  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock."
I am!
"Look out, everyone, friends in reverse!"
"Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face."
Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is...
Watch the sunset with Squidward.
"Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later."
"Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?"
"Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us."
"Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?"
"You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy."
I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
"Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot."
"Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January."
You want me to explode?
"Um, okay, I'll try.  Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it!  Now it's your turn!"
"Oh, good one."
Why would I do that?
What pie?
"Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops!"
Ooh-wah!  Oh!
"Ah!  Hmm, something's missing.  Aha! June 15th.  Fine month for pickles.  Order up!  One perfect patty on a pristine plate in a squeaky-clean Krusty Krab. Man, oh, man, do I love my job!  Hey, Mr. Krabs. What's the good word?"
"Oh, Mr.-  what?"
Bu-bu-bu-but how about if I work for free?
I don't know. Maybe.  Take it.
But--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but--but.
"No, not that, anything but that!"
"Here, I'll get that for you."
"Hey, Gary, I'm home. Forever."
"Oh, Mr. Krabs feels he doesn't need me anymore."
"What's that, Gary? You need me? Oh, the unconditional love of a pet.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am wallowing in my misery, and it's past your dinnertime.  I used to feed everyone in Bikini Bottom.  Now I just feed you.  Oh, thanks, Gary."
"That's how I used to hold my spatula.  Patrick, what's wrong?"
"Gee, I'm sorry. Why don't you come inside?"
"Patrick, the most horrible thing happened today. I got-- f-f-f-f-f-f-f..."
F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
F-f-f-f-f-f-f...
F-f-f-f...
"It's not food, Patrick. I got fired."
"Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have to wor-- oh. Yeah, okay."
"Yeah, sure.  Whatever."
"Uh...  Hey, Squidward. Look at me. I'm fun-employed!"
Uh-uh.
Nope.
Yippee.
I got fired. Now I'm fun-employed.  Whoo-hoo.
Why? What is it?
"You're right, Sandy.  I'm afraid I can't do this anymore, Patrick. Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job."
"Thanks, Patrick.  It's time to rejoin the workforce. Gainful employment, here I come!  Yah! I'm ready! Whoo-hoo!  ♪I'm ready, I'm ready for a new job, for a new job, I'm ready for a new job; I'm ready♪"
"Greetings, purveyor of elongated sausage products! I would love to work at your establishment."
Hmm.  This grill is not in very good shape.
"Hmm. There's something not quite right about this food, but I'm not sure what it is.  Aha!"
"Your weenies, sir."
They're weenie patties.
"Aah! But, Mr. Krabs, why?"
"I mean, Mr. Wiener!"
"Well that was a setback.  Hello, Pizza Piehole!"
"Excuse me, Mr. Pizza man.  You need a fry-cook?"
Eh... probably.
"Cool.  Well, it's no Krabby Patty, but... perhaps I'll find contentment."
Almost done! But I did change the recipe a bit.
"Yeah, of deliciousness!"
But who'll make the Krabby Patties?
"Like I need his dumb job, anyway. I hope his pepperoni falls off.  Hey, taco man, may I have a job, por favor?"
How about that?
"But I've given you the best years of my life, Mr. Krabs!"
Aah!
"Oh, I'll take it, all right. I'll take it to go! Home."
"For years I worked at the Krusty Krab. Now I've been fired five times in one day.  Who are you going to cook for now, SpongeBob?"
"Sorry, Gary, you must be starving.  Don't worry gare-bear.  I'll open up a can of Snailpo for you.  Oh, no.  We're all out of Snailpo.  We'll just have to make our own.  Perfect!"
One homemade can of Snailpo!
"What's that, Gary? It's the best food you've ever had?"
Only satisfaction.  If only my bosses liked my cooking as much as you two do.  I mean three.  Hello. Hmm. That's odd. I could've sworn I heard a knock at the door.
Mr. Weenie?
But you just fired me.
I'm pretty sure this is illegal. What am I gonna do now?
"Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill,  and he really seems to be relishing it."
Pizza sauce?  I'm free!
What?  Parmesan-crusted breadstick!  Whoa!
"Oh, thank you, Señor Taco!  Oh, no! Not you too!"
Whoa!
"Krabby Patty! You saved me!  Well, here we go again."
Squidward?
"Yes, Squidward?"
"Yes.  Yes, I do."
"Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs."
All right! Now my life has purpose again!  Let's get this place cleaned up.
The Krusty Krab is back in business!
"Okay, that's enough stretching."
Now we're ready for a morning jog.
"What's the matter, Gary? Don't you like jogging?"
"Oh, right. You're a snail. Hm. We've got to find a way to get you moving."
This should do it.  You'll tank me later.
"Hey, now you're moving."
Whoa—ow!  I'm okay.  Ow!  Ow!  Yow!
"Aww, poor Gary.  Looks like you could use a leg up.  Or maybe two."
There! A perfect set of legs.  Now let's make some for you.
This will only hurt for a second.  Yow!
"Voilà! What do you think, Gary?"
Let's try 'em out. Come on. Come to SpongeBob.
"Oh, your first steps."
My little guy's growing up.  Now let's try something a little harder.
"Ooh, not bad. Try this."
Nice moves.  Ow!  Ah!  The student has surpassed the master.
"Ready to stretch your stuff, Gare-bear?"
"Hey, wait!  Whoa!"
Oh!  Oy.  After you.
"Oh, yeah, that's right. You're not dreaming. Check it out. Snail with legs, people."
Gary!
Sorry. Guess Gary's new legs got him a little excited.
"Oh, wh—s—sorry!"
"Gary the snail, that was very naughty!"
Oh.  I can't stay mad at you.
Whoa!
"I'm a little beat, Gary. Can you give me a hand with the door?"
"Looks like I should give you a hand, huh?"
Hm? Hm. Hmm.  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Yow!  They look a little tight in the shoulder.
"Whoops! I accidentally gave you two left hands.  Boop! Perfect. Give 'em a test drive, Gary."
Maybe you just need some motivation.
"You're doing it, Gary. Yes, yes! Keep it up, keep it up!  Ow! Yes, yes!"
"That's it, Gary.  Move the—  Move the—  Move those arms."
"Ow!  Yikes! Look at the time! I gotta get to the Krusty Krab.  Thanks for spoiling me, Gary. I didn't have to lift a finger.  My fingers...   Wha—!  A whole weekend of pampering has left my limbs in limbo.  Got. To go. To work.  Hm?  Too weak to flip Krabby Patties."
Mr. Krabs?
"Aww, but Gary is so happy with his new limbs."
"Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry I forgot who I was."
"And Gary, I am so sorry I tried to change you."
"And Patrick, I'm sorry I haven't returned your hat yet."
"Hm?  Well, I guess I shouldn't let these go to waste. I can always use an extra hand"
"Ah, sure is nice having everything back to normal, isn't it Gare-bear?  Yup. Same old, same old."
Oops! Sorry.  Boop-boop.
"Nothing like a fresh frozen Krabby Patty with extra freezer burn flavor.  Here we go... Hmm, grill look a tad dirty."
Say! Who wants...the first patty from our freshly cleaned grill?!
"Okay! How about you, Squid-"
You suuure?
Now all I need is a fresh patty.
"Hey, where'd all this water come from?  There we go. Oh my stars and garters, the sink is clogged up.  Safety.  Now what seem to be the trouble?  Patrick, what happened?"
Trying to see what has this sink all backed up. Would you excuse me a second?
"Ah-ha!  Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug.  Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug."
"The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug."
"Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr. Krabs?"
"Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?"
"The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous. I'm never gonna go near that thing."
What if we get sucked in like those other two kids!
Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?
"Oh, Hi Plankton!"
"Patrick, and I are trying to find the Main Drain"
"Yeah, but Mr. Krabs said-"
I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain...
Mr. Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom.
Does the Main Drain even exist?
"Where is the Drain oh, wise Jenkins?"
Patrick! We need to find that Drain!
Isn't your curiosity piqued? What if somebody accidentally pulls it? What if- What if-
"blah blah blah blah blah. in his mind] Oh man, I hope this question;s not for me. I hate questions."
"What do you think, Patrick?"
I hear ya' Patrick! Let's go find that Main Drain!
Let's start walkin'
"But, Patrick how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?"
"Hmmmm...I have a better idea!  Well, what do you think?"
"Well, that's out."
I know!!
Ohh. How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?
Doin' great Patrick! We'll be there in no time!
Wow. Good job...
WHAT?!?!?! Why would we do that?!
NOOO!!!! We came to see if it was real!
We- We don't know...
"But...if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end!"
Pheeeww. That was a close one...
Huh?
"Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves,  oh, Sandy, aaah...  Sandy is in trouble. Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you!"
Whoa...what was that stench?
You know kah-ra-tay?
"But, Sandy, you already have a black belt."
Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
Okay? How do I do that?
Hm?
Um...sorry. I'm confused.
But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
"Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay."
Okay! Prepare to see the split of your life!
In turn I will!
"Oh, wait! Sensei!"
My match!  I can't get outta here!
Thanks Gary!
Here...I'm right here... I've readied myself...into a full state of readiness...and I am ready...to be ready...I'm so tired...I'm so tired...so very tired...
Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!
Okay Sandy!  Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper!
"Easy for you to say, Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles."
Yes Sensei...
Squidward I...I failed my karate exam...
"Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right!"
Twenty! Got it Squidward!
"Okay! There you go, Sandy!"
Oh! I forgot the fries!
Sigh...You little Krabby Patties are so cute! Hmm...something's not right here.  It's the onions! They've gone bad!
"Okay, looking good!"
Make the fires! I almost forgot!
"Grilling them now!  Your fries, sir!  And your fries, sir! Ketchup?  Oops!  Got it! Gasp! Fuzzy!"
Sensei Fuzzy! You okay?
"For me? Thanks, Fuzzy! Fuzzy? You look terrible!  Sandy, what's wrong with Fuzzy?"
"Thanks, Fuzzy!"
Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
I'll have one...
"One, please."
"One, please."
"Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?"
I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Sure!
Yeah?
Training?
"Assertive, huh?"
Anything I want.  Sounds great!
"Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face."
"...beep, beep!"
But I'm a spo...
Ice cream!
That's my ice cream cone!
You can have it.
"Hey, that guy was crying!"
Yeah!
"Uhh, I thought it was called assertive."
"Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it!  I found something!"
Sure!
"Hey, do you want to take a hike with me?"
Hey! Go check in that ditch!
"Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!"
Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
"Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?"
No it's not!
But what about airline food?
"Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See?"
"Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!"
"Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!"
"Well, not all of me."
I'll do better than that!
What?
"Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!"
You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
Mega Bucket?! You used me... FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT!  That wasn't nice!
"Well, what about aggressively nice people?"
What happened?
No problem!
"Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket."
"Volleyball, anyone?  Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!"
Here's your executive treatment!
"Hello, Patrick."
"Hey, I heard you're in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. That's nice."
You know what that makes you?
An executive!
Uh-huh! An executive treatment!
"Okay, but who are you?  No seriously. Who are you?"
"Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?"
"Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!"
But just look at him go!
"Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town."
Hey at least we have Founders Day!
Tummies! Ha-ha-ha
His taxes?
This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.
"Okay, i'll get right on it."
Who's ready!
"Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand."
"The taste, Patrick,  Remember the taste!"
"Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles!"
"All right, Jelly, out you go.  It's been real fun, but I gotta get to work.  Quite a wind this morning, eh, Jelly?  Whoa!  Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I don't have time to play right now?  Hahaha! No, please! Stop it! Please stop!  Whoa!  Oh! I'm going to be late!  I told you guys, I don't have time to play!  I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook, and I'm not going to start today!"
I need to call in some help.  My fingers are too big for the buttons.
Mr. Krabs! I need you!
"I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!"
They're attracted to my whistley holes.
"Aye aye, sir.  Let's get these patties started right! Wooooh! That gives me an idea."
"Order up! *humming* Ooh, hoohoo!  Oh no. They've found me.  No, no, no, guys, please! Uh, would you mind coming back after business hours? Heh, I'm trying to work here."
"Sorry, Patrick. I need a place to hide from those jellyfish."
"Ever since the wind started, a sound whistles through my holes that the jellyfish seem to love."
"Hahahaha! At least the wind stopped.  I think I lost them. Well, I guess I should just stay here where it's safe... and quiet... and dark. It's okay. I'll only hide out here here for a second. Yeah, it shouldn't take long. Behind these rocks. These sedentary, lifeless rocks."
"Hey, buddy. Just thought I'd spruce you up a little. Auh-what's that? Oh, you don't say. Well, guess what. You're my best friend too. Mmm-hmmm. Come on, let's have some fun. Look buddy, mmmmmmmmm. Dinner's ready. Here, let's have some tea. Want some sugar, buddy? Hmm? One lump or two? Oh, you can have it all.  I feel comfortable around you.  Can I confess something? Cause I know you'll understand. I have this problem. I seem to attract jellyfish! Hahahaha! How do handel a thing like that, Hmmmmm?  Yeah, yeah. I'm in a loss, too. Oh, barnacles. I'm gonna be stuck in this cave forever!  Of course, buddy. Brilliant idea!  We'll see what happens this time.  Whoooaaa, here they come! Go get 'em, buddy!  Hey, guys. Long time no see. Uh, what do you think about my little friend's song?  ...Something wrong?  Hmmmmm. I created one stone SpongeBob that uttered a note in a foul key. But if I were to craft another in a different size,  the dimensions of that hollow center, multiplied by the number of holes, may offer another tune. One that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Eh. I guess I'll just have to make a bunch of them.  Okay, that should do 'er.  Woah. It actually worked. Ah, they're finally leaving me alone. I can go back to work now!  Krusty Krab, here I come!  How long was I gone?!  No! No! No!"
"Yup, and just relax."
OOOH! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
A flower.
They sure do.
Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Yeah.
"That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest."
I thought that meant you were nuts.
"Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby. And if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you say to that, Miss Mittens?"
"Aaaaah!  No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!"
Hey!  You did that on purpose!
Aaaaahhhhhhh!!
♪ I didn't! ♪
But you were... I saw you by the... I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!
There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!
I did! And I took a head start like you did!
"I guess we don't, air breather!"
Tree climber!
Kite flier!
Take that back! You-  not wet person!
Proves what?
"Good one, Squidward!  Woo!"
"I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel.  But you're still just a land creature."
Can you reproduce by budding?  Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
"Most importantly, can you do this!?"
"Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here!"
I don't know!
"Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe...  Yep, won't be long now.  Feelin' light-headed yet?"
Remember this?
"One minute? No problem, Landy!"
"Actually, you know, but..."
"Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it.  There. Mission accomplished."
"No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!"
We're not afraid of your dumb old land!
We're sea creatures!
"Okay... Well, this is it."
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay.  Here I go!  Hey! This isn't so bad!  We can do this. Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!"
"All right, Pat, you made it!"
"Lookin' good, Mr. Krabs!"
"Come on, Squidward, you're missin' all the dry! Come on, Squidward!"
"Well, here we are!"
We're the masters of land and sea!  Hey! It's a local. Hi! We're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks?
"Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy."
"But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy."
Old navy days?! Ohh!
"Ooh, I do!"
Who he?
Ahh!
Chafed!
"Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball."
I don't know!
Don't worry. I always carry a spare.
"Enjoy the cake, everybody. I made it special just for Sandy.  Mm."
"Nope, no nuts."
"Oh, unless you count wall nuts."
"I'm pretty sure walnuts are a fruit though, huh?"
Since when is the moon so green?
"Um, Sandy, how come your treedome is broken and everyone's naked?"
"Good morning, Gary!  Good morning, Mr. Mailman!"
"Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends..."
The best job...
"And, of course, the bestest pet."
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
"Hey, Patrick! How goes it?"
What's that?
"Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company."
Squidward!
Sandy! What a neat robot!
"Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise."
"I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not!  SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs."
"No worries, captain!  Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up..."
"Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you okay?"
"I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me Idiot Boy, it must be true, I know what must be done!  I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gare?"
"I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you.  Goodbye, pineapple.  Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it.  Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538.  Minus 1.  Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy...  Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump!"
Hello there.  What's going on?
Are you talking to me?
"I don't know, is it?"
All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything.
"CheeseHead, huh?  Wait a minute, what's this?"
"Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sandy-  Hey, I remember this place!"
"I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Goodbye, everyone."
Order up!  Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friends?
Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.
ManSponge...
"Oh my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!"
What about the Orb of Confusion?
"Come, BoyPatrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay!"
"What is it, trusted sidekick?"
Looks like he's frozen or something.
"It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him!  Pat, what are you doing!?! We're not supposed to touch anything!"
We could get in trouble!
They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!
"Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free."
"Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that."
Because you're evil!
"Yeah, sure, why not?"
Really?
"Really, really?"
Really Really Really???
"Well, that's good enough for me."
"Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode 17!"
"Oh, me too, me too!"
Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!
"Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?"
"Ah-ah! Wrong.  Good people don't rip other people's arms off!  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?"
"Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see."
"Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good."
"Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!"
"No, you let go!"
"Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word."
No. Please.
Rehabilitated.
"It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch that, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir.  Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooooooooose!"
"That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat."
"Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him! This is a job for Mermaid Man..."
To the Invisible Boatmobile!
Wait! I don't have a license!
"You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy."
"Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion!  Take this!  Doy... Duh..."
Doy...  Man Ray!
"Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?"
"Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?"
"Psssssst. Patrick, get the Krabby Kiddy Meal. Look,  a regular Krabby Patty here, , a Krabby Kiddy Patty here. 30% cuter. And it only costs one dollar more."
Sorry Patrick.
I have an idea. We can buy it together and share it.
"Sure. You see, sharing is the most wonderful..."
Oh yeah.
Aren't you gonna save some of that for me?
Nothing.
"Oh, it doesn't come with a toy."
"Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys."
Gasp!
An officially licensed Krusty Krab toy? .
My purpose in life is to have you as my toy. .
"I love you officially licensed Krabby Patty toy. Not too formal. I think I'll call you, oh, Patty Pal!"
"Oh, hi, Patrick. Have you met my new toy?"
Our new toy?
Sharing?
"I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal.  Now can I see it again, Patrick?"
When's my turn?
Of course.
Now is it my turn?
How about now?
"Nighty-night, Patty Pal."
"Good night.  Poor Patrick. He's only got the Patty Pal for tonight, and he'll be asleep, and won't get to play with it at all!"
"Yes! Today's my Patty Pal day! Oh, this is going to be fun!"
"Gary, of course, Patrick will give me my turn with the Patty Pal!"
"Gary, you can be a real negative nancy!"
"I heard that!  Good Morning, Patrick!"
"Patrick, it's me! SpongeBob! It's my turn to play with the toy!"
You don't have any h- come out Patrick! It's my turn!
I have my milkshake dispenser operator license
"Well, I guess I had best be going!  I'm walking away. Here I go.  I'm gone now!"
"I'm sure!  Hi, Patrick! Time to share!"
"Oh, and you were washing your hair?!"
I'm working out!
"Hold on, buster! Hand over the toy! It's my turn!"
Gary was so right about you! You're a non-sharer!
"Hand it over, Patrick! I get to play with the Patty Pal today!"
How about I only take it for half a day?
How about we trade off every hour?
Every half hour?
Every fifteen minutes?
Five minutes?
One minute?
"Okay, my final offer, we trade off every second!"
One.
Patrick won't share OUR toy.
Water?!
That mediator lady made some good points.
It takes understanding.
It's my turn!
Mine!
Nooooo!
"It's our Krabby Patty toy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so that I couldn't play with it."
Only because you hogged it all night.
Did too!
"Oh, you toy eater!"
"Patrick, that's my money."
"Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur."
"Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef.  For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love.  Enjoy your meal!  It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?"
Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.
Testify!
"Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect.  There, there.  Mr. Krabs will be ashamed!"
Mr. Krabs?
"What's happening, Mr. Krabs?"
Chef exchange program?
"Um, right here, sir."
"I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than...  Just warming up.  Come on, SpongeBob!  Just one egg then...  No, that's not it, no..."
A Krabby Patty.
"Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again!"
"The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab!  So long!"
"I'm sorry, but I've got to go."
Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
Mr. Krabs!
"Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
"You got it, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, Squidward!"
"Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar."
"Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel."
"It's funny, because it's true!"
Nickel.
"Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow."
"Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties."
"Another day, another nickel."
I don't?
But...
I am?
"Yeah, a little."
It's that bad?
"I have been laughing a lot, lately."
My laugh box?
"Is that what happened to you, Squidward?"
"Sure, I'd love a good laugh."
"I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward."
How long do I have to avoid laughing?
"Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here."
"Patrick, banana peel, don't!"
"Oh, no."
"Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!"
"Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh."
"Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!"
"I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh!"
"It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!"
I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.
Mr. Krabs?
I lost my laugh.
Not really.
Nothing.
Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist.
"The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference."
Sounds painful.
"Thank you, Sandy."
I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again.
"Hi, Squidward."
"But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box!"
You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.
I could laugh the whole time?
I guess I did.
"It's really not that funny, Squidward."
"See ya later, Squidward."
"Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world."
"♪La La La La La La La La! Getting clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Oh, what a delightful day it is to get...♪  Noooooo!  Good thing I have a spare.  I still have one more thing to clean!  Oh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet!  And now I'm ready to go to work!  You've got to be more careful, SquarePants!  Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... ... that! Oh, I saw you. Not going to fool me this time, soap.  This is not going well."
"Oh, is that it?"
"Uhh, Patrick?"
"I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here."
"Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean."
"Gee, thanks, Patrick! Now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?!  Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck, not more stuck! How am I going to get to work when I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of wringer!"
"No, Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?"
No.
"No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame-broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, Hey! I can! I'm ready!"
"Woo!  Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!"
"Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!"
"Hardware store! No, from my bathroom."
"Aw, thanks, pal."
Ohh! Squidward!  Squidward!  Are you okay?
Ohh! A refill!
"Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!"
"Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help."
"Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack."
You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!
I don't know... I have too much eye pain.
"Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!"
"That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy."
I said I don't want any!
Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
I have never felt so ashamed.
"If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!"
Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today!
"Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one."
"My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!"
What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
Not fit to live in society...
Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!
"I guess crying does solve your problems after all.  Come here, buddy!"
"Wey, wook. It's Widward!"
Widward's woing to work.
We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
"Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!"
I don't know. Something about his nose?
We've been stuck up here for three days.
"Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?"
"Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse."
"No it's not, Squidward!"
"Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!"
"And besides, we have this!"
"Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?"
"Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything."
"Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?"
It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward?
"Once a member, always a member!"
"Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?"
"Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization."
"Squidward, are you all right?"
"Backing up!  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop..."
"...boop, boop, boop!  Your Krabby Patty, sir."
"You mean with a smile? Yes, sir!"
Not the mollusks!
"There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?"
"Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative."
"Gee, thanks, Mr. Krabs!"
Doesn't that hurt?
"Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family."
"I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor.  I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out."
"Hi, Sandy."
"Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?"
Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.
"Well, there was my uncle Sherm.  He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose."
Gasp!
I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?
So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa.  It was much better than that one we have now.
"Wait a minute,"
"Look, Sandy!"
"SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop."
I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!
"HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness."
"‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! 'Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?!"
"Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA!"
"What, what, you mean karate?"
"Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to..."
Yeah... However...
"Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface."
"As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility."
Okay. Let's start off simple. This is a basic move called the inverted whirlpool.
Think you can handle that?
"Now, this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?"
"Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable."
"Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No one's ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through solid cinder!"
You're a natural! A karate genius!
"Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing!"
"This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes?"
Ahhh... better luck next time.
Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
"Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said."
"Hey, look, it's Patrick!"
What are you doing...
Dear Neptune!
"Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?"
"But, but, but-"
Oooohhh!
Mad chopper?! Patrick!
"Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen."
"Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me."
"Patrick, what are you doing?"
For what?
"You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!"
"Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?"
You're still chopping!
"Patrick, stop it!"
You must resist!  AHHHHHAAHH!
"Wait up, Patrick!  Triton's tunic!"
"Pull it together, buddy!"
"Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?"
Patrick! Your arm!
Hooray for regeneration!
"Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the architectural details."
Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
"Hey, somebody left me a package!  Heavy! I wonder what's inside."
Cousin Stanley!
"So, what brings you to Bikini Bottom, Stanley?"
"Dear SpongeBob. I'm sending your cousin Stanley to live with you. He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, you're always welcome here, Stanley! My pineapple is your pineapple."
"Oh well, now I don't have to clean it out."
Stanley! You okay in there Stanley?
"Well, it was bath night."
Why not?
"Oh, that's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway.  Nothing..."
I don't just work there! I'm vice assistant general manager in charge of certain things. That's me turning the front door key! That's me serving a customer! And that's me performing sanitary maintenance!
"Oh, that. That's me making Krabby Patties! The best job in the world. It's my calling."
"Oh, Stanley. You just haven't found your purpose in life, that's all!"
"I know so. I bet my friend Squidward can help you!  Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin, Stanley."
"Oh, it's okay. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. She's a scientist!"
"This is my cousin, Stanley SquarePants. I thought you could teach him how to be a scientist."
"Err... Maybe you're not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius!  And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you."
That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone!  You'll be learning from the master!
See? Isn't he amazing?
"Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking!  Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Cornerstone of my eternal happiness! I don thee now, in preparation, for this workday.  Wooo! You have no idea how this feels."
"Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you?"
"Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Maybe seeing me totally fulfilled with cheer you up."
"Yes, sir!"
Um... Uh...
"Yes, sir."
"Your job is to take people's money, and put it in here!"
"I... guess I am, Mr. Krabs."
"Well, Stanley. Thanks to you, I'm on probation. If you wanna keep this job, you're gonna have to...  Woo! Customer at the port bow! Man your stations! Man your stations!  Ready for duty!"
"I said I'm ready, Stanley.  Whoa!"
Um...sir?
"About my cousin, Stanley?"
About what I said...
No.
"Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you!  No! Not my spatula! My spatula...  The thing I hold nearest and dearest to my heart..."
"No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! And I also didn't burn your money. He did that, too! I have been covering for him because he can't do anything right!"
"Good luck on your new job, cousin Stanley!"
To see her vacation slides for the hu..  Ow!
Who is this someone? Do we know him?
♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy  I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪  Sandy...!  Whoa!
"Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?"
Where are you going?
You're going on a moon trip?!
I'll be right back!
"Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number."
"Yes, I'm Number 12!"
"I need a bon voyage sheet cake.  Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! Have fun on the moon.... What rhymes with moon? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?"
I got it! See you soon!
"No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake!  Whoa!"
"I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and..."
"I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip!  Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy..."
"Oh, I just wanted to show you the..."
"Oh, I… brought you a bon voyage sheet cake."
"Wha, wha, wha, why not?"
Oh. Is that a bad thing?
"Oops. Sorry, Sandy."
Roger that! Folding hands.
What do you think Sandy?
Ok.
What's moon crater boarding?
Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
"I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try.  Sandy, this doesn't seem right."
Ok.
"Hey, this is kind of fun!"
"Watch this Sandy!  Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up…  puncture into the side of the rocket."
Oops!
"Wait! I have to do something very important!  There!  So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?"
Is that bad?
"Well, in that case, I won't... giant fireball?!  Sandy, where are you going?"
Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
My goodness!
"Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay?  Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation."
How sad.
Need to know in case she ever- .
Have a good night Mr. Krabs.
Old lady? Old lady?
Actually I told you to meet me two paces to the left.
"Oh good, you're here!  I brought the stuff."
"You're welcome, just take them before someone sees us."
Mr. Krabs!
H-How did you find out?
"Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Pleaaaseee!"
But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-
The- the- the- the- the-
What about the curse?
"They are, Mr. Krabs?"
"I got it! I got it!  Ohh, Ohh Hot, hot!  I don't got it..."
"Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?"
"Mr. Krabs, look!"
"Oh anything, Great Hagfish."
"Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel."
She gave me its business card.
...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too.
"It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up."
WOAAHHH!
Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-
...Hide behind...  WOAAAH!!!!
"Morning, already.  I'm coming Mr. Krabs  Don't go anywhere!"
"Take, this!"
We're not finished yet!  I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!  I don't got it.
A closed sign?
What can I do?
What's that?
Do other restaurants do that?
"How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes. Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!"
"I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!"
"Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!"
Empty my mind?
Empty my mind...
Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!
"It was easy, once I cleared my mind."
"Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank."
"Thank you, sir."
"If you need anything else, just call."
Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.
My name?
Uhh... Beef Wellington?
Uhh... err... the fork on the left?
My name?
More soup for your armpit?
"PLEASE ENJOY THE FOOD.  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?"
"Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?"
Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
I'll never talk.
"OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!"
Smells like blubber to me.
"Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty."
"No, it's even better! This is what Mr. Krabs pays me with.  Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!"
"Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?"
"I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature."
Okay!
"Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn."
"Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?"
"No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this."
"Hi, Plankton."
"Ah, yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab."
"It's okay. Everybody has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is..."
"Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of."
"But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?"
"Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!"
"Hey, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug."
Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding.
The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
Push-a-what?
"Uh, I'm not following you."
"Oh, you mean your obsession."
"Hi, Plankton!"
"No, not particularly."
S-s-s-sad story! And so timely!
"Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk!"
La la la la!
"Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?"
"Okay, buh-bye!"
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!"
"This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!"
"Hey, glad I could help."
"Okay, Patrick, one more book, then you go to sleep, 'kay?"
This one is called You Can Be Anything.
"Oh, sure you can, pal.  You can be a firefighter...  You can be a doctor...  You can be a cowboy."
Cowboy. Great choice.
"A horse?  Buddy, I don't think you want to be a horse."
"Sure, sure, you can be a horse.  Nighty-night, Patrick."
"Not now, Gary. Give me a few more minutes.  What? Uh, Gary?"
Huh?
"Oh, horsey!  Patrick, you were right! You can be a horse."
"Easy there, big fella.  Easy..."
"Ah!  That's a good horsey. Hmm, horsey. That's not right. You need a name! I think I'll call you... Patrick!"
"Whoa!  Ride 'em, cowboy!"
"Uh, bucking bronco."
"Safety first.  Giddy up, Patrick!  Looking good, Ms. Sandy."
"Morning, old timer."
"Sure, but be gentle."
"Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs, I think Patrick will only let me ride him."
"Giddy up, Patrick.  Giddy up."
"Horsey Patrick, come back!"
Patrick. Patrick...  Patrick.  Patrick!
"Patrick?  Hey, it's okay, boy. It's me.  Your old pal, SpongeBob.  Remember?  Okay... Would you like me to whisper?  Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick. Good Patrick.  Calm down, buddy. I don't want to lose you again.  Whoa! Ow! Ow!"
"Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me.  Patrick horsey, giddy up!"
What?
"Wow, Mr. Krabs. How'd you get Squidward to give rides?"
I'd put my pile of dog food up against your stud any day!
You're on!
"Well, okay.  Mmm.  Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!"
"Whoa! Whoa, shortcut. This could be a trick. I love tricks!"
"Whoa, whoa!  Hyah! Oh, boy, we're ahead!"
"Oh...  Huh? Whoa, Patrick. Whoa."
"Here's your delivery, sir."
What?
"Okay, buddy, but remember, you can still be anything."
"How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy?"
"Oh, yeah. Well, what do ya think about this, baby?"
"Uh-huh. ‘Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! My old teddy walrus! This stuff really takes  me back."
"Babies don't talk like that, Patrick. They talk like..."
"Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. He should probably see a doctor. Come on, let's take him to the hospital."
"So what's the prognosis, doctor?"
"Okay, Squiddy! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle?  Patrick, how could you!  There, there! My little darling. We're supposed to protect his head, remember?  Okay, Squiddy! I made your favorite. Krill tartare with an algae vinaigrette.  Here it comes, open wide!  Come on, little buddy, you got eat healthy so you can grow up to be big and cranky. Just watch the airplane land in the hangar.  See, Patrick, sometimes you have to out-think the baby.  You know, Patrick, maybe we..."
"Okay. Time to lighten things up. Do you like games, Squiddy?"
"You like that, Squiddy?"
"Ohh, this game's kinda dangerous."
"Hooray!  Squidward!  Squiddy, are you okay?  We need to do a better job of protecting him."
"There, there now, no need to cry."
"You said it! I'm exhausted! Hey, Patrick. I have to go to work. Would you mind holding Squidw....  I guess it's just you and me, little fella."
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties.  The poor guy has the mind of an infant."
But...
"All settled into your work station, I see. Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all! Now let's make it official!  Oh, how silly of me!  Squiddy needs a high chair!  And duct tape!  Oh, Squiddy! I'm so proud of you! Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me! And look at you now, working and sitting in a big boy seat!"
"Remember, buddy! I'll be right behind you!"
"Squidward! That's not for eating!  There we are. Good as neww-!  That's not for eating either!  Sorry, sir."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs.  You know what to do.  Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on, huh...  Will this be for here or to go?  We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy."
"Squidward! Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby! You oughta be ashamed!"
"Mr. Krabs, watch his head!"
"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!  Oh."
Sorry!
Sorry!
"Sorry!  Okay, Squiddy! Hold still! And, oh, boy!"
"Mr. Krabs, if my poopy baby isn't welcome here, then I'm not staying either!  Squidward!"
"Oh, Squidward, you're back to your normal grown-up self."
Yes.
"Sorry, Squidward, I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra..."
"Kids, they grow up so fast."
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
"Oh, Gary, I'm so excited!  Tonight, they're showing the only episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy that I've never seen! Whoo-hoo!"
It was lost... to the sands of time.  Until they found a copy in the producer's underwear drawer.
"It's part two of the two-part special, The Case of the Curious Cliff Hanger. Well, I've rearranged the living room for optimal TV viewing."
The popcorn's a-popping.
"And the soda's on ice. All that's left is to set the VCR to record  so I can relive the magic over and over forever.  Hmm, but which tape to use? Don't have any blank ones left. Hmm.  Oh, here we go. Who needs a tape of their own birth, anyway?  Yoop, done!  Now it's just one quick shift at the Krusty Krab, and I'll be back for the evening's entertainment."
"Normally I like working, but today is moving  so slowly."
"Oh, at this rate I'm never gonna see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy."
Hmm?
"Aw, you guys always make me feel better.  Hmm?"
"All right, bye, Squidward! Bye, Mr. Krabs!  See you tomorrow!"
"Oh, uh, well,  I gotta get home for Mermaid Man, but—but sure, I guess I have a little time."
"Luckily, I brought all my tools.  Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer— Whoa!  Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!"
Gotta get that old tire off. And...  Yes? No. Maybe if I try...
Hmm. Ah-ha!
"Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go."
"Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff."
"Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace.  Ah, home sweet pineapple!"
"Oh, uh, not really, but—"
"Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. Mermaid Man is on soon."
"They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?"
Here you go.
"Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride?"
"Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause Mermaid Man is on and it's the lost episode—"
I don't really have a lot of time to—
That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna—
But Mermaid Man.
Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it!  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.  But Mermaid Man.
"Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, Mermaid Man!  Oh.  Where'd I put my keys?  Did I leave them on the table again?  No, my tape!  My soda!  My popcorn!  My Mermaid Man!"
I was so busy helping everyone that I missed Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!
Play…
"I'm not really in the mood, Sandy."
"Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?"
"Oh, okay."
Huh? Whoa!
"Wow! Yes, yes!"
"Ah, oh, bravo! Bravo! Bravo!  Yes! Ah!  Thank you, everyone!  I loved the show! And I loved the love you showed me! And I love how you showed me the love you showed me in the show I love.  This is my favorite episode of Mermaid Man ever!"
"Aww, I'll play with you, Old Man Jenkins.  Do you wanna be Mermaid Man?"
I still don't understand why you had me wear a blindfold.
"What's your club, hmm?"
Whoa! I'd love to rest my intellect. Can I join?
Wow. They do seem blissfully brainless.
What was that?
Hmm?
Hmm? Uh...
What? You said drink!
Huh?
"Uh, we're gonna do some civic duty?"
"Patrick, why are we doing this, again?"
I have a feeling you guys are a little confused about what civic duty is.
Maybe their pockets were already full.
Aww…
"Oh well.  I guess I'm just not Empty Head material. Well, bye, buddy."
"Well, that's funny. I seem to be lost. Oh, I'll figure it out. I still got so life in the ol' brain stem."
"What's a brain stem? I know! I'll just walk backwards and that should get me back to the beginning of the day.  I'm even more lost-er than I was before-er.  Oh, I will direct asking— Ask directions.  Excuse me, large lady. I'm a widdle girl who's misplace herself. Can you help find me?  I'm pretty.  Ow!"
"Well, that didn't come out right."
"Oh, I've forgotten how to sit!"
"Uh, now my name's Buddy?"
"No, not mine.  Wrong brain.  Oh, bad brain. Oh, I guess I'll take this stupid one."
"Slime ready! Uh, dime Betty!  Spaghetti! I'm sweaty! I'm all wetty!  I'm ready.  I'm ready! I'm ready! High-five!"
"Patrick, I know you and the Empty Head Society mean well, but man, we sure messed up a lot of things in town today. So, I'm gonna reverse all the damage that we did during the Nitwitting!"
"Oh, that's weird. Everything's already back to normal. What?  Hmm. Well, it's still a mess over here.  Sandy? You cleaned everything up?"
"Yeah, they're badges."
"No thanks. After giving my brain a vacation, I need a rest."
"Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note."
Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.
"I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey, Squidward! Want to play?"
Are you sure?
"Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy!  Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!"
"Hi, Squidward!"
"I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!"
"Oh, I'm not hungry."
Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
He's hungry.
"Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything."
Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
Sounds great!
"Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?"
"Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!"
"Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?"
"Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch."
"Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward..."
"That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!"
"Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here."
See what I mean?  All done!
"Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy."
My friend's in there.
Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!
"Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own."
"Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished!"
"Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?"
"Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?"
Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
"Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern."
Why?!
No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never...
"No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?"
"So, what do you say?"
Noo...
So long.
Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.
"Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time!  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?"
Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? New Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.
Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!  Please...?  I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages!
"Sorry you had to see that.  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath.  What? Can you say that again?  Slow down! It's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da...  That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house! Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure! Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen...  40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest!"
"Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub.  It's treasure! Look, doubloons!  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch!"
"I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!  In the tub!  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to...  Gary, could you...  Gary, no!  Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped and/or frustrated me for the last time! So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery! . Come back, Gary! I have something to chair with you.  Dish is more like it! Water you waiting for, Gary?"
"Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary! . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin!  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant!  I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath and you are going to get clean right now!"
I am so the boss of you!
"It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules."
"Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say.  What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister!  Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary The Snail, do you hear me? I am giving you 3 seconds to get away from that mud puddle! 1,  2,  two and a half...  don't make me say 3!  Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!!  I'm a dirty boy..."
"Yeah, yeah, Gary.  I'm getting behind my ears."
"Hey, Patrick."
All ready to go jellyfishing today?
I see you even brought your double net.
"Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?"
Your— never mind.
Good idea.
Here we go.
A horrible storm?
"Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up."
"Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it."
"Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather."
"Actually, I can't."
Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
"Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us."
Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
The one Preflumster told us about.
"C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea..."
"Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking."
Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
"Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—"
"Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers."
That's better.
"Squidward, the lights went out."
Patrick! What is it?
"Thank you, Patrick."
"Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first."
"Oh, yeah."
Two.
"Oh, it's a tie."
Tie.
Tie.
"Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk."
"Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun."
"Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward."
"Come on, Patrick. You can do it."
Be the puzzle piece.
"Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you."
"Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!"
"Go, Patrick, go!"
"Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!"
Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
"Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over."
"Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—"
"Please, Squidward?"
Please...
What is it?
I have a question.
Where are you going to get the chalk?
Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
"If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers."
Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
"But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth."
Stop that cephalopod!
"This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules."
"Patrick, look out!"
Your food?
"Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways."
It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
I don't hear anything.
"Squidward, wait!"
"You know, Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!"
Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?
How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?
Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.
Nah! I feel fine!
"Now that you ask, I don't know.  I think I just felt a twinge!"
But I feel great today.
"Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color."
Morning.
"What's your name, handsome stranger?"
Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common!  I always wanted a twin brother!  How do you feel about bubbles?
Jelly fishing?
How about Squidward?
I think I'll nickname you... Me two!
"Hey, look. Another handsome devil.  We'll call you Me Three  Aww. Let's go flip some patties."
Okay. Thanks.
Sure.
Looks like you sponges have everything covered.
"Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?"
The Chum Bucket?
"Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula."
You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.
Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!
What does that mean?
Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't!  No! Don't disappear!
I can believe it.
"Well, you see, it's...  Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge.  I can't believe they're all gone."
"Hey, those imitations were my friends."
"Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around."
"Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake, and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip."
"Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare."
"Patrick, what are you doing?"
Why?
Small portion meals?
"Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man.  Hi there."
"Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this alleged starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books."
"Wow, Patrick, that's great!"
That you're king!
"When you're a king, you can get anything you want."
"Your wish is my command, your majesty.  Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king."
The king would like...
"That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free."
"Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about."
"Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you."
"Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants."
"Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker."
"Yes, sire?"
"Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel."
"I know, isn't it great?"
"Uh, right away, your majesty.  Umm, Squidward?"
"Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?"
"Patrick, what's happened to you?"
"Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and..."
"And, um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk."
"Uh...well, I..."
"Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!"
Ooh. Skill Crane.
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs."
"Well, why don't I give it a try?"
It's a bear! I'm gonna call you Beary.
"Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over!  That takes an awful amount of skill."
"Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend."
"There ya go, Beary."
"Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward."
"Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud."
"But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday!"
"Money, money, money, money, money!"
"Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother."
"Two in one quarter? That's not fair.  What's that, clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion?  There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward."
"Squid, I think you have a problem."
"Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine?"
Mmhmm.
Are you ready to be a winner?
Yeah?
Yes?
Yeah?
Yes?
"Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my quarter. Then I close my eyes."
"Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane."
See? Now you try.
"Squidward, do you wanna win or not?"
"Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in."
"In the machine, Squidward."
Close your eyes.  Now be the crane.  Be the crane... be the crane... be the crane.
You're a winner!
"Triple decker, on deck."
I sure did.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah, you're the man."
"Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply."
"Wait, Squidward!"
"He did it. Yay, Squidward!"
"Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch.  Ding.  Tada!  Ah! Squidward, open your eyes!"
"Hang on, buddy. I got ya.  I guess I can only pick up toys."
"There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!"
"Hi, Grandma!"
"Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies..."
"Me, me, me!"
Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!
"Thanks, Grandma!"
"I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today."
Did I do something funny?
My forehead is funny?
"No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma."
"Really? You do, Squidward?"
STOOOOOP IIIIIIIIT!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time!
"Me, too."
"Thanks, Patrick."
"You're right, Patrick."
"Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how."
Tax exemption!
I'm a grown up!
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!
"Patrick, we didn't say that!!!"
All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years...!
"Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop."
"He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way."
"I am? I mean, of course I am."
"I am glad you see it my way, grandmother."
"Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick?"
So much for no more baby stuff.
"Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby."
"Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?!  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults!"
Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup.
"Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz..."
It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do.
"Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious."
Storytime?
"Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it."
Huh?
"No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?"
"Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work."
"Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later."
"Yep, that is it. Here I go."
"Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater."
I don't know when I'll be back.
"So, uh... that's it."
Soooo loooong...  I DON'T WANNA GROW UP!  I want cookies!  and milkie!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear diadies!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo!
I don't?
"Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?"
"Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy.  See you later, Gare.  Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun… together. Okay… …Love you, Gare-bear. Bye."
"Poor little snail just wanted some fun time.  I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now.  Welcome to the Kru-  Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside."
Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay.  Too distraught to even answer the phone.
"My outgoing message is a lie.  Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up…"
"Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon."
"Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home."
"Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?"
"You're the best, Mr. Krabs!  Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?"
"Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work."
They're so precious!  SOLD! I'll take that one right there!
"Oh yeah, this is the one."
"Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye."
"Hello, Gary!"
"I've brought you a surprise.  Your very own play pal.  His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back."
"Eat up, you two.  Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy.  Come here, you.  There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas."
"Done!  Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot!  Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends.  Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond.  Great, now my enchiladas are cold."
"Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?!  Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight.  I hope you're happy now."
"Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend.  Aww, look at you two so cute together."
"I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night."
"Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with."
"Gary! Shame on you!  Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless.  See? There he is, fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please?  Good night."
"Mmmmm. You're making meatballs, Grandma? Time for dinner already?"
"Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along!  Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh, well, what are you gonna do?  That's unusual. Whoa!  My library!  And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut!  My clothes!  This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for...  ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend.  Gary! You are in big trouble, mister!  Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear? Gary? All right, Gary, you have left me no choice!"
"Gary!  You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary!  Bad! Bad! Bad boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad!  I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh, hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy?  What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt."
This is exactly what I was talking about--
"Fluffy! Fluffy, wait!  Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?"
"Ah, this is more like it. From now on, I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home."
"It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out."
"Okay. Ready, Patrick? One..."
"Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One..."
"Three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper?"
It looks like a giant pencil!
"It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it."
"Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck."
It's a jellyfish.
"Eh, everybody's a critic."
"Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic."
"Do you know what this means, Patrick?"
It means we found a magic pencil!
Coming right up!
"Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such."
Okay! Why didn't you say so?
Hey! Another jellyfish!
It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
We can't let it go into town!
Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!
"Oh, Squidward!"
"Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me!  Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!"
He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...
"DoodleBoy, stop!"
What have I done? We've got to find him!
Where could he possibly be?
"Come on, let's go!"
"Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there..."
"Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!"
No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.
"See what I mean, Patrick?"
"You okay, Patrick?"
There he is.
Uh... *ahem*.
"He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him."
Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!
"Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?"
"I'm sorry, what was that?"
"Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...!  I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!"
"Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?"
"Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince."
"Good night, magic pencil.  Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!"
"Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school."
Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!
"Take a look for yourself, Patrick."
"No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose."
Exactly! See how happy he is?
"Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?"
"Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing."
It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine.  Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!
"Oh, it is."
"Well, let's take a look.  I think we've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!"
"You go first, Patrick."
"Au contraire. After you, mon amie."
"No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend-  -Oof!"
I'll go first.  Question 1: What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........Aquamarine!
"No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed."
"Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!"
Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?
"No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed!  You haaaaaaaaaave..."
...an innie!
Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
The answer is...beige.
Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
"Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous!"
"Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?"
"Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie."
"Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?"
No.
"Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?"
"Uh, last question!"
What shape is your best friend?
"What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?"
SQUARE-pants.
Five seconds.
Time's up!
"Uh, no."
"Well it wasn’t a tie, but we had lots of fun."
"Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right, Patrick?  Patrick?"
"Thank you, best friend, Patrick."
"Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla."
"Here! Take your dirty, rotten money!  Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE!"
"It just isn't fair!  Oh, who needs Patrick anyway?  Rest of my life, here I come!"
"Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star."
"Oh, Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!"
Really?
Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick!
"I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself!  I can go jellyfishing!  Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog!  I can blow bubbles!  Uh, maybe not."
"Oh, it's Patrick! I can't let him see me!"
"Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all."
Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly!
"Patrick works out at the gym?  And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either."
Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back!
"Hold it right there, Patrick!"
"Oh, I'll bet you were... to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!"
"I know, he is pretty amazing..."
Who for? Sandy?
"Really?  For me? What is it?  Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!"
"Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick!  How do I look?"
"Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket."
"Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir?  Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?"
"Uhhhhh, uuh uuh."
Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?
"We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed!"
"Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings."
Sure he will!  I just bought one.
What do you mean? I love it.
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice."
But think about how valuable these paintings might become.
"When art gets older,  it usually gets more expensive.  Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday."
"Okay, Mr. Krabs!"
"Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery."
"Oh, hi, Squidward!"
Just getting some ice.  Fresh.  Need some help?  Whoa!
"Eeh, we'd better get you home."
Your eyes are so pretty.
What are we screaming about?
"Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends."
"Ha, this tickles."
"Bye, Squidward!"
"Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!"
"Run, Squidward, run!"
"Run, Mr. Krabs, run!"
But a little slower than Squidward.
"Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob."
"I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe."
"No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!"
"Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!"
"Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that."
D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!
And I helped.
"Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!"
Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no!
Ow. Shell phone! I know. I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do.
Squidward!
"Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller, The walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too!  Oh no!"
Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
"I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone!  It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?"
I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad.
We can't build a house!
"Alright, Patrick, lets get to work!"
Yeah! So what do you think?
Really?
One bedroom.
"Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop."
That'd be great!
"Good night, rockmate."
"Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...?"
"No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob!"
"Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward?
"Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?"
"Thanks. Thanks, Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?"
"While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?"
"Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy."
"Yeah, I like sleepovers."
"Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward."
"Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you."
Here come my parents.
"Hi, Mom."
"Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye."
"Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom."
"My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!"
"Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there."
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands."
"No, they're usually silver."
"Um, Mr. Krabs?"
I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
But I...
Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
"But, I'm a...a liability."
Really? Everything?
A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
Here I am!
"SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor."
"Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  ."
"Yep, right in here."
Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case."
Bombs away!
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!"
Huh?
"May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender?"
"Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand."
"Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?"
Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
"So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?"
"Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?"
"Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open!"
Defense calls Plankton to the stand.
Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
"Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty..."
"That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present."
Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a wet floor sign. I made it myself.
Order up!
"Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K."
"Oooh, let me see there was... none."
"What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?"
Oh! My very own press badge!
"On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look.  No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for!  Patrick Star, I'm Scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?"
"Whoa, this story is juicy!"
"Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?"
Imagination!
"Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?"
Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this!
"Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote."
"Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles.  Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady."
Very interesting...
"Hello, Larry."
Ruined? What are you talking about?
"Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?"
"That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good."
"Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?"
"Yeah, I... I know."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that."
"Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people!"
"Mr. Krabs, you wouldn't!"
"Aye-aye, sir."
"Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore."
I've seen people's lives ruined with my own eyes!
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir?"
"Oh, the wildest story ever, huh?"
"Ah-ah-ah, it's a surprise."
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay?"
Ohh!
Hmm... what's this?
"All alone? No one to talk to? Why not write to a total stranger? Connect with other Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Pen Pals Today! Oh, I've never had a pen pal!"
"Hmm... Dear Pen Pal, my name is SpongeBob SquarePants... Oh, that's great! I work at a restaurant. I love frying and I'm very good at it. Sincerely, your new best friend! Behold, the perfect letter! Now for the envelope."
"Gary, get off of that! You'll spoil my masterpiece!"
"Nah, it's just a little slime."
"Ah, perfect!"
"Dear SpongeBob, Wow! You know how to fly? Fly? What does he mean by..."
"Gary, my pen pal thinks I can fly!"
"Ha! What a silly misunderstanding. I can't believe I know a real life pilot! I wish I could watch you fly, because I am dying!  Dying?! Not Pen Pal!"
"I don't want to let him down and say that I can't fly! 'Cause then, his dying wish will never come true!"
Time to make Pen Pal's wish come true with a tiny white lie!
"Dearest Pen Pal, yes, I can fly! Boy, do I love flying! Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!"
"Dear SpongeBob, I'll be at the Bikini Bottom Air Show tomorrow. Please meet me there so I can finally see you fly?!  Oh no! What have I done? What have I done? What have I done? I can't fly, Gary! I'm not a flier! I'm a liar!"
"Good thinking, Gary.  Sandy will know just what to do."
"I did a bad thing, Sandy! I did a very bad thing!"
"No, no. It's not that. It's... it's..."
I lied!  I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied! I lied!
"Uh, what on a which?"
By who I've a where's in?
"Well, there was this big misunderstanding and now my pen pal thinks I can fly! And I don't think I ever mean it, but now I have to! If he doesn't see me fly and I don't know how! If I don't fly, he'll die disappointed! I made a horrible mistake, Sandy! Please help!"
Really?
"Seatbelt, check. Controls, check."
"Oh, I'm good."
"Oh, there's my house!"
Oop. I've forgot to feed Gary.
"Oh, hi Gary."
I'm doing it! I'm actually doing it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Did I do it?
"Hey, you must be Pen Pal!"
"What an honor it is to finally meet you! Oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you."
"I just wanted to say that today... Today...  Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you. Oh, I will not let you down."
"My heart is full too, Pen Pal.  My heart is full too."
Take off. Don't die. Fly a few seconds lower to the ground. Don't die. Slam. Don't die. So simple.
"Sandy, I'm nervous."
"No, it's still not that."
Just fine.
"Pen Pal, this one's for you."
Whoo-hoo! I'm flying! Yee-haw!
Patrick? You're Pen Pal?
But... but you said you were dying! You're not dying!
"See? It says, I wish I could watch you fly because I am dying!"
"It all makes sense now!  Oh, Patrick!"
"Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me!"
"Ah, something's wrong with the plane! Here, take the controls!"
"Hey, Patrick. Who's flying the plane?!"
Hold on! We're going down!
Whew! We ran out of gas.
"Patrick, it was my pleasure."
Let's hear 'em.
"Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!"
It was an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!!
"What!?! But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against! We're talking about an ALASKAN BULL WORM!!!"
"But, Sandy, you don't know!"
Sandy! Sandy!
Wait! Sandy!
"Sandy, don't go!"
"Sandy, I saw it! It's BIG, SCARY AND PINK!"
You'll get massacred!
"Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?"
"Um, I do?"
Um... in my pocket.
"No, it's not, this is your tail."
"HOW WOULD YOU KNOW!? IT'S ALWAYS BEHIND YOU! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go!"
"Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen fedibble no-hip'?"
"You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!"
"Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!"
"No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!"
You are.
You did.
You do.
Okay.
There isn't anything...
Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but...
You see...
I...
"Sandy, are you sure you...?"
"Sandy, that's not...!"
"Sandy, that's not...!"
Sandy!
Sandy...?
That's not the worm.
That's not the worm. That's his tongue!
"So what's the plan, Sandy?"
"I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!"
"Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?"
I wanna hear you say it!
Say it!
"Say it, or I'll trip you!"
Say it!
Say it!
I knew it.
"Uh, Sandy?"
What do we do now?
"I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for SpongeBob or S for Sandy! That way they can identify our bodies!"
Yay! He'll never get out of there!
Yay! Let's go tell everybody!
Easy...  Perfection!
"Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away."
"That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?"
Mr. Krabs?
What's a hidey-hole?
What's in this thing? Treasure?
"Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?"
"Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?"
Neat.
How'd you win that?
Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?
"Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?"
You were?
"Well, I guess you were thinner back then."
You want me to punch you in the stomach?
"wow, my entire arm disintegrated."
"Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail."
Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?
You're alive! And naked...
What's molted?
Wow.
Barnacles!
"Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down."
"Who cares how silly, pink &amp; fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp &amp; soft you are. How...  ...oops."
"Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!"
"Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not about what's on the outside. It's what's on the in..."
I get to be a navy buddy?
"Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years."
"Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money."
I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
"Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety."
"Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel."
"Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them!"
"I won't let you down, sir."
Coming!
"Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here."
Like pineapple? I live in one.
"Well, if you think you're man enough."
Fire the torpedoes.
"Thanks for the trophy, everybody."
I...uhh...
Let me spin you a manly yarn.
"So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields."
Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
"Why, jellyfishing, of course."
"Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks."
"Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean,  arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all."
"Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men."
"None taken, Mr. Krabs."
"Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide."
"Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin'?"
"So, what flavor is it?"
"No, I mean the toothpaste!"
"Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium-sized hole in the wall!"
Careful now...
A drive--- whoa!
"Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go. It even lights up, see?"
"I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than the things I bought?"
How is this stuff better?
"I'll have that ready in two shakes in a lamprey's tail!  That oughta' fix it!  Thank you, come again."
Squidward! Hi!
One Krabby Meal! To go!
"Sure thing, Larry!"
"Mr. Krabs, I'm concerned."
Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's S.U.B.!
"-Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!"
Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra chee-?
I'm on it!
26 orders up!
"Squidward, are you sure?! These customers over here look really, really hungry!"
Mr. Krabs! We gotta do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs!  We can fix it!  We might need to buy some more toothpaste though."
"Well, back to work."
"La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow."
"Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?"
"Oh, you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—"
"Morning, Squidward!  Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes?"
"Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!"
"Mr. Krabs, I really think I should be getting back to the grill now."
All aboard...
"Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion?  Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!"
"Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies!  Open up, open up, open up!"
Mr. Krabs?
"Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look!"
"Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You've poisoned all these people!"
"Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs."
Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?
"Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn."
But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
I didn't even know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days."
Pearl? What happened?
"Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?"
You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
"Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready."
"It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love."
"Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!"
"Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty."
"There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt."
Take a break and play around with us.
"I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!"
I already took care of it.
"My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone."
"Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs."
"You are a real pirate. Go straight to the X that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!"
"Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again."
"I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?"
"Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs, you gotta...!"
"But, Mr. Krabs..."
"But, Mr..."
"But, Mr..."
"MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?"
"Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs."
Pirates?
"Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!"
"Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!"
Ow.
Really? Can we see the map?
"Okie dokie, then!"
"Okie... oops.  I mean...  ARRGH, Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH..."
"The whole ship is underwater, captain."
"But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, cap'n?"
"Mr. Krabs, we're tired."
"Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew."
"I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent."
But we've only been gone a few hours!
"I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!"
He's not here.
"Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick."
"Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map."
"No, guess there isn't.  Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself!"
Yeah?
"You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?"
"Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!"
Look! It's the X.
Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!
"We got it, Captain Krabs!"
"What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?"
We found it together. So we deserve a share!
What about loyalty?
And one for all.
And one for all!
And one for all!!
And one for all.
Wow!
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  Oh, I can't even cry right!"
"Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!"
"Oh, about $100 a semester."
Really?
"Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?"
"You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff..."
It is?
Okay!
It does?
I do?
"Mr. Krabs, you're so wise."
"Rookie mistake, right?"
"Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch."
"Oh, I'll say."
Patrick's house!
"Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk."
"I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat!  Uh-oh."
"Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!"
"Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... ]"
"Oh, yeah."
You never!
Snapping!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs."
"Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs."
"Uh, yeah, some of it."
"My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me."
"Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but..."
Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.
"Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes."
Right! Oh-ho! Ha. Mr. Krabs.
Oh. Huh. A shopping list?
♪Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea!♪
Wow. The stuff on this shopping list is pretty exotic. I'm not gonna find any of this at Barg'N-Mart.
Hold on.  Something super secret.
Not that side.
"Well, what do I do?"
"Sandy, does it seem a little dry in here?"
Thanks.
The first item on Mr. Krabs' list is...hair from a yeti crab?
The next item is milk from a giant fangtooth fish.
I found it!  But how do we milk it?
Is one udder better than another udder?
It's on the list.  See? Ghost dandruff.
Got it!
"Well, we got everything on the list.  Oh, Mr. Krabs will be so proud of me!"
"Aw, my ingredients!"
And you even had enough to cover his buns.
"Oh, Mr. Krabs!  I got all the secret ingredients on your list, but Plankton stole them all! I made the apocalypse!"
"So, my list was a fake? So, no apocalypse?"
I saved the world!  No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse!
"Mr. Krabs, are you okay?  What's a matter? Is there too much money? I'll get rid of the money."
"Old Man Jenkins? But I love Old Man Jenkins! He always has old and interesting smells,  and his bones make such funny noises,  and his eyes are the milkiest shade of white , and—"
Ooh.  Ahh.
"Well, gee, Mr. Krabs. If you want Old Man Jenkins to leave, why not just try asking him nicely?"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs. I couldn't ask Old Man Jenkins to leave after hearing his story. His feet hurt,  and his grandson never calls,  and he has to take a pill that helps him to remember to take his other pills.  Why, he takes so many pills, he's more pill than man."
"It's just a penny, sir.  It doesn't matter."
"I see her, Mr. Krabs.  A Krabby Patty with cheese.  The classic."
"Hey!  that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!"
"Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single."
She doesn't like to talk about it.
"Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?"
"Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs!  You look great.  You wait here while I go break the ice."
"Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving."
"I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?"
Don't move!
"Mrs. Puff,  I'd like to introduce you to Mr...  Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs."
"Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello.  No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello."
Wait.  He's trying to tell you something.
Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to...  ...hit you with a rake!
Try to guess your weight.
"No, wait. He wants to take you...  ...on a date!"
"Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?"
Breath spray?
Lucky hanky?
Giant rusty anchor?
"Relax, Mr. Krabs.  Just a little joke.  Good luck with you know who."
Mrs. Puff.
"I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?"
What are you gonna do?
I wish there was some way I could help.
"I don't get it, Mr. Krabs."
Nope.
But you said...
"Mr. Krabs,  I got the flowers you wanted me to buy."
I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.
But you said...
"Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for..."
I bought the biggest box they had!
"Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?"
"Oh, I think she..."
"As your financial advisor, I suggest..."
But...
One shady hat.
"I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing."
"Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  Arrgh, SpongeBob! Yer spending all me money! And then I'll say, But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said! Then you'll say, We're not talking about this...  ...Or this...  ...we're talking about this!"
"Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see?  Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted."
See?! You just did it again!
"Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think?  Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet!"
"Wow, it's Sunday, Gary! Guess what's for breakfast?"
"That's right!  A sundae!  Whoops... Looks like we're out of ice cream. Guess I'll have to use something else... Ketchup!  Hmmm... Bananas... Cherries... Boring.  Ah, here we go! Onions!  Ready, Gary?"
"Just one more thing! Pea...  ...nuts. Gary!  Our peanuts jar is totally empty!  Hmmm...  Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts.  Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill.  A little texture never hurt. There we go.  This sundae's gonna taste great!  Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me!  You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Okay, let's see my to-do list.  Go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work, go to work..  Wait, that's not right. I need the one for Sunday.  Ah, here we go. 'Say hi to everyone in Bikini Bottom'.  Hello.  Some people are even late on Sunday.  Hi, Mailfish.  Hi, Mrs. Crossing Guard!"
"Wow! A parade! Hi, parade!   Hi, tuba player, hi, drummer, hi, guy with the cymbals, hi, trumpeter, hi tambourine girl, hi, timbale man, hi, didgeridoo player,  hi, triangle player, hi, guy with the kettle drum, hi, pianist, hi, guy with the flute. And heeelllooo, Dolly!"
"Was it something I said?  Something weird is going on today. Everyone is running away from me. And now...  ...giant piles of bubble gum?! Oh, what next?"
"Oh, hi, Patrick. I'm confused."
"Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch.  Hi, building!  I just don't get it."
"Good one, Patrick."
Ugly?  You gotta be kiddin' me..
Hi.
Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly!  Am I ugly?  Am I ugly?
Oof I'm ugly...
Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am.
"That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?"
"Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks, Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over."
I can't.
"I know, Patrick."
I'm ugly.
Square?
I'm ugly and I'm proud.
I'm ugly and I'm proud.
I'm ugly and I'm proud.
I'm ugly and I'm proud!  I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!
That felt great! I feel empowered.
I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through.
"Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you."
"I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide."
Hello.
Hi.
"They all ran away, Patrick."
"Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered.  I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!"
"Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?"
And why is that bag on your head?
Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
Patrick...?
Patrick?
Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad.
"Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!"
"No, I mean just this morning."
What else?
Sundae...  Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
"I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!"
"Oh, guess what, Squidward?"
"Gary, come and get it!  Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?  Gary must have gotten an early start.  Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again.  Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab.  I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks.  Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again.  Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head.  Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs.  Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy?  Gary?  He hasn't touched his food!  Squidward! Open up!  Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing!  Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward?  You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet.  It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too!  Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing!  Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?!  Mr. Krabs!  He's gone, too!  Sandy! She's gone.  Where did everybody go?!  Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them.  SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius.  Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise?  No! Now get to work!  Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please?  Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why.  Coming up, Squidward!  Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea?  Why sure! Whoops, just a sec.  Why sure now, SpongeBob.  Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat?  Ahem, floor it?  That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob!  Why thank you, Mrs....  Pu... Pu... Puff!  This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again!  Ooh, my driver's license!  That's the baby.  Hi, fella, it's me.  It's okay, I'm licensed.  Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la-  -la-la-la...  Good night, Boaty.  No! No!  No!  Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-!  So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty.  This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great!  Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one.  What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work.  Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane!  What? A puppet of my old best friend?  Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat?  Oh, Boaty, you are a card.  Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke."
"Who, Boaty?  Oh no. He's... Really?"
"Wait, Patrick! Don't go!  Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed."
"Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear.      Huh?"
"You're all still alive? Well, where did you go?"
National No SpongeBob Day?
A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks.
"You too, Patrick?"
I'm... glad you had fun.
Really?
Wow. A whole day dedicated to me.
"But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?"
"Like that barrel.  It says, Property of Salty Sea Farms."
"Are you renting the barrel, too?"
Then you bought it?
"Then, isn't that stealing?"
And this Bikini Bell phone.
...And Plankton's lawn mower.
Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers.
"Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without  permission."
What do you want to do today?
I don't know. What do you want to do today?
I don't know. What do you want to do today?
"It's okay, Patrick.  There's lots of money in the First National Bank of SpongeBob.  Follow me!  Uh-oh. I'm broke, too.  Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward?"
"Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!"
"Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right?"
We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon!
Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop!
And the candy shop!
And in a plane!
And under a hill!
It popped...
I got the pieces!
"Hurry, put the pieces on!  We popped the balloon!"
We can't return it!
We're thieves!
We have to confess.
"You're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal."
It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks.
Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back.
We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs.
We're going to have to travel lighter.
"We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men.  We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warm around the fire."
"No more nice, warm beds."
No more Krabby Patties.
No more getting mail!  No more Gary!   No more movies!  No more Squidward!   No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs!   No more anything!
"But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean... at least we have each other."
"And all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right?"
Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun!  We can loosen our ties!
Yeah!!  AAAAAAHHHHH!  Okay... we still can't do that!   But we don't have to shave...
And you get to talk tough!   This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
"And the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed!"
What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan.
"Aw, Patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever!"
Look what I've got!
Not just any rectangles.  Candy bars!
All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives!
"You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face."
What?
"No, I didn't."
"You ate yours,  this is mine."
"Here Patrick, just take half of mine."
Do you want it or what?!
This is my candy bar!
"...it's pants on fire, Patrick."
"Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah...
"Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!"
Not if I tell on you first!
You're going to get in trouble!
We stole a balloon!
What are you going to do to us?
But...But...we stole a balloon.
Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again.
Hello!
"A little drone told me you two are new parents. So, I just had to bring over a little present for the baby. Hello, baby."
"Look, Chip, your uncle SpongeBob got you a little something.  It's a can of compressed air to keep your keys nice and clean, like this!"
"Whoops.  Sorry, Bubble Bass."
"Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat."
But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
"Oh, Patrick"
"Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!"
Oh...
"Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind."
"Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?"
"Back it up?  Okay. Back it up, Patrick."
"Oh, oh, oh!"
"Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick..."
"Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!"
"Ah, that's perfect."
I'm down here.
"We shall, Patrick"
"Hmm...Hm?  Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!"
"Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm."
"Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery.  Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!"
"Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house."
"Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong."
"Don't look down, Patrick!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!  Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—   Hiccups."
"Here comes another one, Patrick."
"Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch."
"Well, this is a dilly of a pickle."
"Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch."
"That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us."
"Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax."
The formula! I can't cook without that formula!  I can't don't anything without it! The Krabby Patties are gonna taste like ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chum!
How?
"The po-po? Oh, no, no."
So-so.  But I'll go-go.
Isn't it a crime to impersonate a police officer?
"Deput—wow! I always wanted to be an officer of the law! Check it out.  I'm the fuzz. Ooh, look at this!  I'm also a flat foot!  Watch me work.  Mr. Mime, you have the right to remain silent.  Stop or I'll shoot...you a nasty look."
Well...they should.
"Hm? Ohh. What have we got here? Excuse me, miss. Have you got a license to sell these cookies?"
"Let me handle this, Officer Mr. Krabs! Well, missy, do ya?"
"Yeah, that's what I thought. You're under arrest for violating penal code 4968973025-D."
That's classified.
"Central booking, also known as the cop shop."
Still classified.
Huh? This sweet little thing?
But I don't know how to interrogate.
"Um...questions and act tough. Got it.  Hmm...  Okay, little Helen!  What do you think of this weather?"
I want a lawyer.
"An idiot? I don't know! Is it hot in here?  Pressure—I can't—okay, I'll confess! I'll confess to it all! Anything! Whatever you got!"
I have a confession to make!
"Oh, but, officer, I have more confessions."
Guilty! Yay!
"Well, I must confess, this is sure cozy."
"I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?"
"No, Patrick!"
"Patrick, I needed those."
57 times.
I'm a winner?
I'm a winner.
I'm a winner.
I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!
"I didn't get a license, Patrick."
"No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all."
"Let's just go home, Patrick."
"No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive."
"No, Patrick. No!"
I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
"I'm here for you, buddy."
You got a perfect score?
Perfect score.
Like a winner.
Huh?
I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!
"Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license."
Two millionth?
"Yeah, just like you."
Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.
"Thanks for the ride, Patrick."
"Patrick, what are you doing?"
"4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?"
You got your license.
You got a new boat.
Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.
"Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired."
"Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work."
Thanks for the ride.
That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
When did we get a drive-thru?
I used to have a dream.
"Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I—"
"What's with the helmet, Patrick?"
Uh-huh.
Oh?
"Oh, that would be great."
Patrick!
Mom!
Hey.
"Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph."
40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.
"Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?"
"Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!"
You're suppose to stop!
Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
"I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!"
"If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!"
"Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!"
"Patrick, what do you think you're doing?"
What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Patrick!
"I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy."
What?
"Oh, then what do we do with this?"
Yeah!
"Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!"
I hope I do as good as that guy.
"Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?"
"And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup?"
"Umm, noxious gas?"
"Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh..."
"Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?"
"I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too."
"And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?"
"Because, they're so darn stupid!"
I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
"Well, at least I don't have to clean up my act!"
"Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh, hey, Sandy!"
Did you enjoy the show?
"Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom."
We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time!
"La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid."
"Oh, hi, Sandy."
"We already talked about that, remember?"
"Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around."
Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them.
"Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one."
"Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water? I mean, the stuff's everywhere."
"Uhh...  Hey, what about this thing? Huh? Huh?"
"What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make:  your friends...  ...or your career."
"HOWDY, Y'ALLLLLLLLLL!!!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?!"
"My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?!  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you. Do you understand now, Sandy, huh, do ya?"
"Great. I knew sooner or later you'd understand. What a great sport!  Let's give a big hand to Sandy. But clap slow, because remember, SHE'S A SQUIRREL!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter?"
"You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy."
"Sandy, are you feeling alright?"
"Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat."
"But, Sandy, that, that's not a..."
"SANDY, I NEED WA..."
WAAAA...
WAAAA...
SANDY. WATERRRR.
Sandy!
"Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!"
"Okay, Sandy, okay!! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes...  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of your squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb?'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge.  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae.  Look at me! I got no bones!"
"Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!"
"Now, let me tell you about those fish. Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo, how could a creature who spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really.  SOAP, SOAP. WHAT IS SOAP?  And don't even get me started on starfish!"
And...
"Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?"
One large sea fries coming up!   Eeeeeee!
...Krabs......nominated......award...award?
Road... trip!
Ooh! Can I call you Daddy?
Pa?
Pop?
Papa?
My old man?
Daddy-kins?
Grampy Joe?
"Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
"Good luck, Mr. Krabs-"
What's a tip?
"Aye aye, sir!  Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny-  quarter."
My quarter!
I cook Krabby Patties.
"Twenty five, twenty six-"
"You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!"
No.
"Um, uh, uh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red."
Blue!
"Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer."
"Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees.  Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks."
"Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent."
"Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries!  And let's not forget these hotel towels!"
Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!
"Well, only if you help me exaggerate this air conditioner!"
Duh!  Exaggerated!
Sure.
Oops.
Ahh. Isn't this fun?
"Good morning, Squidward! See you at work!"
Ow!
Ow!
Something Squidward this way comes.
We're playing flashlight tag.
We're using the advanced rules.
"Oh, well played, Patrick!"
"Squidward, we're playing tag! Not hide and seek, you silly!"
"Patrick, Squidward is really really sad..."
"How about instead, we do something extra special for him! Then he won't be sad anymore!"
"Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it"
"Yeah, vow."
I like it!
It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!
"Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears."
"Sorry we couldn't make it last forever, Squidward."
"This is it, Gary!"
"The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!"
"I'm ready, Squidward!"
"No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!"
"Hey, I'm getting mine next."
"Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready..."
"Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!"
First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
The bow.
Stern.
Starboard.  Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924!
"Oh, in this boat right here?  Is it time already?"
"Oh yeah, absolutely."
1924?
The boat?
Floor it?
Floor it?!
"Okay, floor it!!!"
Floor it!
"I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times."
"Okay, thirty-eight."
"No, Gary, I'm not walking."
"What is it, Patrick?"
"Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood."
"Okay, now what, Patrick?"
"Okay, I'm at the closet."
"I don't know, Patrick."
"Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about."
I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
"...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight."
How are we going to do that?
"Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head?"
"Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over."
Mooooooooo.
"Here you go, ma'am."
Uhh...
Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
"It's okay, it's only the boat."
I... I think so.
1924?
Put it in drive?
Floor it?
I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!
I think I'm cheating...
I think I am cheating!
I do have an antenna under my hat!  There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!"
Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
No... I'm cheating...!
I'm cheating!
"I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!"
No...!
Cheater...!
"Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated."
"Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff."
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike."
"Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!"
"Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?"
Seat-belt-aroony. One second.
Start the engine?
Now what do I do?
"Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?"
I failed?
I got Mrs. Puff fired.
I am?
"Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive"
"Ready for my test, sir."
Crawl?
Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew!
"How to drive, sir?"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
That'll be easy.
"Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge!"
"Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?"
"Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?"
"1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13."
Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm...
"Yes, sir!  Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball.  Nice boy."
"Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts."
Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold.
But I can't do it without a blindfold.
"Aye aye, sir.  There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts."
"Man down. Man down.  Sorry, excuse me. Sorry."
"Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!"
"Hey, I can't see!  Did I pass?"
"Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm unteachable."
"I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.  I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time."
"There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!"
"He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!"
"You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air!  Right? I'll try my oyster call."
"Come on, come on, wake up already!  I think it's working!"
"Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!"
"No, the show's about to begin!"
Uh...
Right.
"I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!"
"Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home!  Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory."
"No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?"
"Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!"
"Sorry, neighbor."
"Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster."
"Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically."
"Well, um... I... uh... no.  Squidward?"
"Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?"
Um... have you found out anything?
"I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!"
"Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy."
"Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut."
"Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!"
"Uh, uh, just a second!"
Y-y-yes?
Y-yes!
Yes...
Yes!
"Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!"
"Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!  Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!"
Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!
"I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I..."
"I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom."
Mr. Krabs!
"Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!"
I'm adding the love!
"Well, I'm not here for the money.  I'll always treasure these moments we had together."
Awww...
The Jim? He who flipped patties in the before time?
"Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?"
That's me!
"Yes, sir."
Would you sign my Krabby Patty?
Yeah. Not unless you look right in front of you!
"What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?"
"I'm the new fry cook, sir."
Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?
Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!
Am I a fraud?
Crying my eyes out.
"Why, Squidward?"
"Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!"
"The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign.  Dear Mr. Krabs,..."
Me?
"Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain.  Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2."
"Goodbye, freezer."
Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook."
But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.
Wow! I never thought about it that way!
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs."
The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.
Oh.
"Excuse me, miss?"
"I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or..."
"Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad,  just in case I have to write an essay."
Hi! I'm SpongeBob!
That joke was almost funnier the second time.
That time it almost seemed like...  ...you did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?
Can I be excused for the rest of my life?
"Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff."
I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One... two...  OH NO! THAT'S THREE! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.
"Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!"
Really? What's it say?
"...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.  Death row, next in line speaking."
Patrick? Is that you?
"Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!"
"What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up."
"Patrick, you there?"
"Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?"
I can't tell you.
"I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that."
"Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us."
Flats says he's going to kick my butt!
"Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you."
"Yes, Mrs. Puff!"
YOU WHAT?!?!?!
I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?
"Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt."
AAAAAAAHHH! OUT OF MY WAY! OUT OF MY WAY!  Can't you see he's going to kick my butt?!
"Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! BobPants SpongeSquare. Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after."
"Hey, Flats... you feeling better?"
"Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure."
AAAAAAAHHH! He's still gonna kick my butt!
"Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it!  'AHH!!! Flats!!"
"Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is!"
"Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly."
"Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles!  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of... spongy material! Do you know what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'."
"A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!"
"Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true."
Plankton! It's you!
"Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner."
"I said, you're a--"
"I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie."
"Hi, Mr. Plankton."
No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Play with me.
"No, but I like to go jelly..."
...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
"Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net."
"You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that."
And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
"It's not about winning, it's about fun!"
Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
"What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪"
"Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪"
"Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!"
No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Okay!
Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
"He's changed, I tell you!"
Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
"What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?"
Why can't you just accept our friendship?
"We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here."
"I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey, Bubble Bass!"
Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs?
I can't believe this!
What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
How can you not see it!?
But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?
How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!
What?!
Really?
"Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed."
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!"
"Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?"
Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
Training?
"Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!"
"Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?"
You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
"Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use."
"Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness."
"Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time."
"Patrick, your snail is a rock."
"Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now."
"Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win."
"Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do."
"Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!"
"Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life."
"No, Patrick, that's the official."
"Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it."
What!
"What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!"
"Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!"
"Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!"
"Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!"
"Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?"
"Uhh, Gary?"
"Umm, Gary, you can stop now!"
"You can take a break now if you want to, Gary."
"No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!"
"Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!"
"You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!"
"You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!"
Gary?  Oh!
"Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?"
"All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?"
"Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty."
"Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here."
Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?
"What could it be today, Gary?"
A videotape?  You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants. I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!
King of Karate?
"Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!"
"Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate."
"Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there."
"Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one."
"All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?"
What make you think that's Karate Island?
"Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived."
"Oh, thank you."
"Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty."
"You hear that, Sandy? He called me master. Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em."
"Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?"
The one and only.
I'm ready to be King of Karate!
My throne.
"Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend."
"Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?"
But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
"Sandy's going to miss out, big time."
No!
"Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself."
"No, Sandy!"
You mean I'm not King of Karate?
"Don't do it, Sandy!"
"Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo."
"I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?"
"Good morning, day!  Ow!  I stubbed my toe!  I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe!  D'oh, that was my favorite shirt."
That's a sad song!
"He was a good little Krabby Patty.  I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I----I came to love him!  It just isn't fair!"
But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—
You yelled at me! You yelled at me!!!
And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.
Why?
"Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain."
What's this?
Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.
"Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore."
Excuse me a minute.
"Hey, Patrick."
"No, I'm still at work."
Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?
"Okay, great, thanks, Patrick."
"Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is."
Okay.
"All right, see ya.  Okay, it's a bet."
"Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me.  Ooh, what's the matter?"
"Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward."
I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry.  I can do this!
I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.
It's...
"Oh, well, sunset's over.  Nice of you to drop in, neighbor."
Aww. He looks like an angel.
Yeah...  No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Yes?
"Mother, father?"
"Ohh...  My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?"
Hooray!
"Oh, no."
"What, what, what?"
"Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?!"
You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.
"Yes, Squidward?"
I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments.
"You said something, Squidward?"
"That's a really sad song, Squidward."
"No.  Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed."
"Yes, Squidward?"
"Now you're talking!  Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?"
That sounds like a very sad story.
Walking...
"I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward."
"More popcorn, Squidward?"
"Don't be shy now. I made extra.  That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here."
"Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?"
"See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?"
"Ooh, that sounds fancy."
Whoa!  Where'd it go?
"Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?"
Whoo-hoo!
"Gee, Sandy, this sure feels..."
"Hey, Squidward!"
"Hi, Sandy!"
"Yeah, me too."
"Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever."
Together forever.
"Don't worry, I'll drive."
"Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Aye aye, cap'n!"
"Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon."
Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  I can't... reach the buns.
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it."
"Time is money. Right.  Hello, bun. At last we meet."
"Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other."
"Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!"
Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!
"Uhh, hi."
"Wow, they really liked it."
"Squidward, I wouldn't--!"
"This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs."
I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
"Hi, Patrick."
Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
"Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games."
"Ah, sorry, Patrick."
You have to be a fry cook.
What do you mean easy?
They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!
"Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!"
"Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!"
You take that back!
You don't even have fingernails.
How can you hear it?! You don't have ears either!
Cone head!
Pink!
Fine! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
"Patrick, what are you doing here? You're not a fry cook."
"Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust."
Not if I eat it first!
Pink!
"I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. I thought Patrick was my friend."
What do you mean?
He is?
No!
I'm angry!
For the Krusty Krab!
"Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick."
I scream for ice cream!
"Top that, Pinky."
"Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet."
I don't like you!
I never liked you!
Pink!
Yellow?
"Let's promise never to fight again, buddy."
"You too, Patrick."
"Ah, thank you, Patrick."
Neato.  Watch this.
"You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing."
Hmm...
You want more?
Let's go to Sandy's.
"Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented."
Maybe even smarter.
"I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you."
Oops.
Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door.
Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?
"Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight."
"Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick."
Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.
Where's Sandy
Uh-oh.
"Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there."
"No Sandy, you need air, not food!"
"Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup."
Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back."
"Okay, I'm ready."
"Hurry up, Patrick."
"That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air."
"No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right?"
"And you breathe air, right?"
You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.
"Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down."
I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.
"I know. Wish me luck, old friend."
"Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down."
"Yeah, here we go."
"Welcome back, Sandy."
"Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble."
"Nice try, alarmy, but you've got to get up pretty early to wake me up on picture day!"
"Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque.  Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!"
"Fine, fine, not to worry, no problem.  I'm ready, again!"
"It's time to take a corrective approach.  Good morning Squidward! I'd love to stop and chat right now, but it's Picture Day. Whoa!"
"Still looking good, Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner."
Ketchup?
"Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today."
"Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I..."
"And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new...  No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen of...  Sponge Gloss.  There it is. So close, and still so shiny.  Hey, it's just water.  Aww! Stamps?!  Oatmeal!  Glue."
"Patrick, a little privacy here."
"Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world."
Ew!
"That's it!  This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time."
"Uh, Patrick..."
"No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly!"
"Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells!"
"Wait, can I go home and change first?"
"Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!"
I can't stop crying!
"Cheese.  There I am.  Hey, I don't look so bad after all!"
Wow!
I'm just checking out the beautiful clams. Did you know it's migration season?
"Patrick, it's okay!"
Do you need to blow your nose?
"Sure! Here, use these."
Patrick!
Maybe we better just use our eyes.
Just look at all those majestic species! There's the Soft Shell Clam.
The Hard Shell Clam.
The Giant Clam.
Even a Razor Clam.
"Aw, I wish the clams were closer to us so we can get a better look."
Wait! I know! They're always hungry when they migrate!
"Patrick, the patties are for the clams!"
Patrick!
Aw.
It's working!  Huh?  Isn't that beautiful?
"Why, Squidward?"
Maybe I have been feeding these clams too much.
♪Walking to work ain't too shabby! 'Cause I'll be whipping up a Krabby Patty!♪  Huh?
"Go on home, you clams! I have to go to work now. Go on. Go home. I don't have any more Krabby Patties for you. You need to find your own food.  Okay then. I'll just—  Oh! Follow the leader!"
Bye! I'll see you crazy clams later.
What are you doing? You know it's not nice to steal other people's food!
"Aw, don't worry. I see that we understand each other completely now."
"No! Bad clam! Sorry, sir!"
"What am I going to do? I can't leave the clams alone. They'll just have to go to work with me. Come on, you clams!"
"Remember, no stealing food."
Perch here and be good clams while I work.
I couldn't leave them outside. They were stealing people's Krabby Patties.
"Uh, stealing people's Krabby Patties?"
Bad clam! Don't spit pearls at nice Mr. Krabs!
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll get all these clams out of here right now."
Didn't you just tell me to get the clams out of here 'cause they're stealing food from your customers?
"I've gotta get these clams out of here!  Follow me, clams."
"I figured if I tired them out, maybe they'll behave better."
"Let's go, clams. Good boys!"
"There you are! No dawdling, now, come on."
"Hey, there you are."
"No, no pushing! We share the swing. Like this. Just watch.  Whee!  Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!"
"Oh, hey, Squidward."
"I'm sorry the clams messed things up, but you must remember, they're wild animals."
"Oh, maybe you're right. If you really want the clams gone, then I'll lead them out of town."
"Well, then, I guess this is good-bye."
"Oh, the life of a clam is the best!  Brr! Getting cold out. Must be fall. I hate to say it, little clams, but it's time for you all to fly home to warmer climates.  Don't be sad. We'll see each other next year. I promise. Now go on.  The circle of life. Whelp, guess I should migrate home, too."
"Oh, wait, Squidward. It's just me!"
"Okay, have fun, you two."
It sure is nice to be home.
"Welcome, friends! Please come in!"
I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation!
Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide!
"Wait! Come back!  See, it's Patrick!"
Where?
Oh! That's because Patrick kept spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz!
Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry.
I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!
Probably because I have.
Been waiting.
Patrick! They're here!
You bet!
"That's not luggage, it's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember?"
"No, Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination!  The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines..."
And ropes to swing on...
"And a water park!  Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it.  I can't wait to get there! How about you?"
Yeah...
Yeah!
"Hey, why does he get to go first?"
Maybe we should just sing the road song.
"♪When I'm on the road, I see stuff going by. When I'm on the road.♪"
♪When I'm on the road.♪
♪When I'm on the road.♪
♪I want to sing it all day long.♪
Um... anybody know any other good road tunes?
How much farther to the nearest service station?
"Oh, you're right!"
Hey at least they have a cozy-looking waiting room!  Come on!
"Man, am I bored."
Mm-mmm. This looks more like a grey-ground.
Actually this place seems a little bit-
"You're preaching to the choir, Patrick."
You did? How?
"Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it.  This is fun! Hey Patrick, you-"
"Hey, Patrick."
"Patrick, I'm right here."
"Well, I was on this see-saw-"
"Patrick, do you need help?"
"Hey look, a swingset!  Can't go wrong with this old-time playground favorite.  Weee. Hey, this is almost like being at The Great Barrier Reef, huh? Try it, Patrick."
Go back and forth like this.  There you go! Now you're getting into the... swing of things!
Patrick?
Patrick! I'm coming!
Patrick?
Patrick! Are you okay?
You're not?
"Yeah, Patrick, wait for me."
Something tells me that is a one-way drain.
"How long have we been walking here, Patrick?"
Why?
Are you getting hungry?
I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us.
It couldn't?
"Well, I coud've sworn that I heard-"
"No, that time it was my stomach. There's got to be something around here to eat.  Patrick, I found some berries we can-  not eat!"
"Patrick, where did you get  the kelp cake?"
Oh.
Nope. ...Run for your life!
It's getting closer!  Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do?
I'm too young to be digested!
You do?
Roger!
"Okay, now what?"
"Yeah, cause if he's eating us, he's having pancakes for lunch!"
"Patrick, we did it!"
Hooray for not being eaten!
"Yeah, Patrick?"
"Oh, don't worry. When we get to The Great Barrier Reef, we'll eat like kings!"
"Alright! Now put 'er there, Patrick!"
"Ooh Patrick, have you been using a different moisturizer? Your hands feel kind of-"
Wait a second.  Okay now.
"I know Patrick, but now it seems to be-  Our best possible course of action!"
"Don't worry, Patrick, your patience isn't the only thing that's wearing thin!  Grab it, Patrick!"
"Oh, I got it!"
"Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick?"
"Patrick... Patrick, did you hear that?"
"This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall!)"
What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere?
"Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff!  You gonna buy something?"
"Oh, you could never have to many-  Oh no! I just realized what this place is!"
"Patrick, we have walked straight into a  tourist trap."
Shhh...
"Come on. Let's escape, before we spend all our money on useless trinkets."
"Patrick, wait, I saw a very nice driftwood sculpture over there that would work great as a mantlepiece."
"Patrick, that tourist shop took me for everything I had! Now we don't have any money, we're still lost, and we're gonna be in big trouble! Oh, this vacation is a disaster!"
You don't?
"Patrick, you're right! We went down a sewage pipe..."
Bounced off a huge anemone...
Hid in a nest!
And swung on some vines! Which are a lot like ropes! This vacation has it all!
What's that?
My poor parents must be worried sick.
I suggest we start walking.
"Good idea, Patrick. I'll just play the road song on this whistle I got from the souvenir shop."
"Well, thanks, Patrick, glad you think so."
"What do you mean? Who else could-  Oh no, not again."
I think it's offering us a ride!
♪When I'm above the road. All I see is sky. When I'm above the road. On a giant fruit fly. When I'm above the road.♪
♪When I'm above the road. I'm as snug as a baby bug in bed. Let's all sing the above the road song. I wanna sing it all day long. Let's all sing the above the road song.♪  ♪Let's all sing along!♪
"Thanks again. Patrick, I think that is the friendliest terrifyingly large insect I have ever had the pleasure of being carried off by."
"Hey, Sandy!"
Check out our new balloon.
What is it?
"Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do?  Vroom, vroom, vroom!"
"Patrick, you heard Sandy.  We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this!"
And under no circumstances should you ever touch this.  Boink.
"Ooh, so swirly."
Wow!
"Oh, oh!"
"Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one."
"Maybe there's an exit this way.  Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn.  Huh?  Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!"
"Mm... Oh, Patrick, watch this!  Boink."
"Whoops, sorry!"
Nice décor.  Hmm.
"Oops, forgot to draw the ground."
"No problem.  Two patties coming right up!  Your doodle patty, sir."
"Yeah, they are a little dry."
I miss Mr. Krabs.
I miss Gary.
"But Patrick, I'm right here."
"Aww, isn't he cute?"
"Ooh, I'm next on the hug list."
"He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum."
"Hold on, Patrick!"
You're welcome.  I guess we need to be more careful.
Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.
We'll have to fight doodle with doodle.  Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad!  Attack!
"Patrick, run!"
"Patrick, I'm going in.  Cover me."
"Huh? Whoa!  What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?"
"Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!"
Patrick!
"Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you!"
"Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of... SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table!  Charge!"
Ha-ha!
Release my friend before I get really tough!
I gotcha! I gotcha!
In here.
Phew.
Patrick!
"Oh, we'll never get back home!"
"Oh, Squeaky!  Squeaky!  Grab on, buddy!"
"Too slow, DoodleBob!"
"Here, Patrick!"
"Well, that's the end of DoodleBob."
"Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home.  Wait a minute, Patrick!  Doodle us home, Sandy."
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
"Sandy, we're back!"
Sandy saved us.
"You wanted to see me, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs."
"Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir."
No!
Could you repeat that?
I won't let you down.
Yes?
"Uh, SpongeBob."
"Yes, sir!  And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patty, secret ingredienty.  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?! No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe?  What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?"
"Right away, sir."
"Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!"
"Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me."
With this.
"Not that kind of help! This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!"
"Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!"
You and I are gonna have to do a little detective work!
Aha! I knew it was you!
"Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!"
Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
"All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk!"
Then how do you explain this?
And so the truth floweth forth.
Mm-hmm.
Yuck!
"Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?"
"Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist.  There she is.  You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look.  Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy!  Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?"
"Oh, long enough, buddy."
"I'm onto you, squirrel.  You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties."
"What I am getting at, is that you...  ...cloaked yourself an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter..."
"...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties, so you wouldn't have to pay."
"283 Krabby Patties.  That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility."
"My own house, huh?  Why'd you do it, Gary?!"
"You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!  First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tear ducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient."
"Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup."
"What's that, Gary?"
"You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this... this marauder to the sketch artist?"
"Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few...  He's not cooperating."
Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.
"Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!  And we have an eyewitness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case."
Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without...  tap dancing shoes?
I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient.
"Mr. Krabs! I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!"
"I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow."
"All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it."
Me?!
"Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?"
"Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties!"
Ta-daaa!  I did it! I did it! I did it! I did-
I learned a magic trick!
"Sorry, Gary, but I've been trying to learn this trick since I was a SpongeBoy.  I gotta show Patrick!"
"Patrick, come on, I got to show you something!  Patrick? He's not home.  Oh! Squidward!  Squidward! Squidward, Squidward, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, Squidward, Squidward?"
Squidward! I'm so glad you're home. Got a magic trick to show ya!
How could anyone hate magic? It's...  ...magical.
"Pick a card- oh.  Watch closely, Squidward. The hand is quicker than the eye."
I want to show my trick to somebody.
Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff!
"Mrs. Puff, you got to see my magic trick!  Pick a card, any card!"
"Wait, Mrs. Puff, you didn't see my trick!"
"Pick a card, any card!  Sandy!  Sandy, I gotta show you this.  Pick a card, any card!  Sandy?  Where's your head?"
"Uh-huh, okay, I'll come back later when you have a head."
"Pick a card, any card!"
No.
"Ah! ] Hi, Fred!  I've got a magic trick that's going to dazzle you!"
"Uh, no, this isn't going to involve your leg."
"Why won't anyone watch my trick?!   Hey, that gives me an idea!  There. Good evening, folks, I am the Great Spongedini! Now watch closely,  the hand is quicker than the eye. Pick a card. Any card."
Ta-da!  Oh... I still wish Patrick was here to see it.
"Oh, Patrick! You showed up just in time. What was your favorite part?"
"Oh, then you haven't seen seen anything yet!"
"What's going on, Mr. Krabs?"
We get breaks?
Nice meeting you.
No! Never.
"Uh, I just spotted a spot."
Employee break room? I never knew this was here!
"Oh, it's beautiful! Like stepping through a portal into the magical realm beyond!"
I just hope there's enough time to enjoy everything.  Ooh!
"Ooh.  Enjoy your carousel, my little hot dog friends."
Surf's up!  Wipe out.
I think this used to be...creamed corn!
"Oh, Globby, you're so silly."
Voilà! My break room band. Scrubby and the Cleaning Crew. Hmm...  Let's see if I wired everything right.  Perfect.  Yeah!
"Oh, come on in, everyone. Try the funk, it's fresh."
"Oh, yeah!"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, that was so much fun! I can't wait for my next break in 20 years!"
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!"
"Hmm, wonder where Squidward got to. Oh, well."
"Oh, hi, Squid...  Whoa!  I love your hat."
"A beret? Oh, where can I get one?"
We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving.  I made this one using designs of me and my best friends.  And I also made this cute little scallop house.
"And I made this wallet,  and I crocheted money to go in it."
"Do you want to make crafts, too?"
"Hey, don't be sad. You can be an artist, too. I'll find something that will tap into your particular artistic skill set.  Now let me see. Oh, this'll be perfect! Now, start with a rock..."
A little glue...
Stick on a couple of googly eyes...
And presto: A rock with googly eyes!
Now you try!
You can do this!
"Oh, sorry."
"Yeah, let's take a look!"
"Oh! Oh! Oh, it's beautiful!"
"We both are. It's lots of fun! Would you like to make something, too?"
"Wow! Did you hear that, Squidward? Patrick is an artist!"
"How many lousy pieces have you sold, Squidward?"
"Squidward, I think we should have a little talk about your gambling problem."
"Oh! I'm almost late to be early for work! See ya later, Patrick!"
"Hiya, Patrick! Ordering up a delicious Krabby Patty?"
"Oh, Patrick, that's terrible.."
"Make yourself comfortable, Mister Patrick! Our artistic consultant will be right with you!"
This is Mr. Tentacles. He'll be handling all your artistic advice needs!
Here's your Krabby Patty!  Shall I put it on your tab?
"You did it, Patrick! You found your inspiration!"
"You got it, buddy!"
Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases.
MERMAID MAN AND BARNACLE BOY!? MUST. GET. AUTOGRAPH.
AUUUUUTOOOOOGRAAAAAPH!
"Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone.  Mermaid Man's belt!"
"HEY, GUYS. WAIT UP.  I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOOOOOU..."
"You forgot your belt! You forgot—  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations!... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not.  I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does.  Whooooa.  The small ray! Eeeee!!!"
"There you go. Come again, sir."
I don't know.
Nothing.
Nothing.
"No, no!"
Yes.
"Me, uh... either."
Please don't tell!
Please don't tell!
"Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!"
Don't!
No!
Do-o-o-n't!
I'm begging you!!
"I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!"
"Uh... uh, okay, uh..."
Uh...  Uh...
"Uhh, I can do it!"
"No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!"
"Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look."
"No, Patrick!"
Patrick!
"Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident."
"Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life."
You think so?
"Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!"
What?
"Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word."
"Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you."
Oh no!
"Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!"
"No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise.  Until then, you'll be safe in this jar."
"It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it."
Sandy!
"I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and..."
Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
"Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed."
You don't understand!
Mom?
"Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and..."
"I've got it!  Ta-da!  Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese!"
"La, la, la...  La-la-la, la, la-la-la..."
I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning.
"Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this:  Ahhhhhhh..."
Really?
I'm not normal?  Squidward?  How does one become normal?
"What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal!  How to be Normal. Hm, this videotape should help."
"Yes, yes, and yes."
Normality.
Craters and freckles?
Yeah...
"Hi, how are ya."
"I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal."
Yup.
Yup.
Wonderful weather we're having.
"Okay, see ya 'round."
"Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally."
"Hi, how are ya."
"Hi, how are ya."
Wonderful weather we're having.
"Okay, see ya 'round."
"You know, it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal."
Maybe this thing is out of ink.
What you call dull I call normal.
"I guess the decision to be normal was more life-changing than I thought.  Hi, how are ya."
"Oh, I got normal."
"Let's do something normal, like window shopping."
"I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?"
"Okay, see ya 'round.  Hi, how are ya."
"Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal."
"Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house."
"And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go.  See? Looking normal already."
"One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants."
"Oh, what happened? I lost my job, then my best friend, and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus...  and clench.  Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional."
"That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again."
"Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me again."
"Oh, thank you, Patrick!"
"Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now."
Tap erus uoy era?
Huh?
I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.
I don't wanna be normal!
Normal is not worth it!
"Wow! I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life."
"It sure is, buddy. It sure is."
"I'll save you, Mr. Krabs!  Ooh, Mr. Krabs, thank Neptune you're okay.  Eww, what was that noise?"
"But, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and I don't want to leave work early. Right, Squidward?"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I could still—  A nickel?  And it's the same temperature as Mr. Krabs.  Ooh, he's gonna want this back."
Follow that boat!
"Roast moblem, Orfficer."
Mr. Krabs!
"I brought your nickel, silly.  What is this place? And what are you doing here?"
"Usual? Chum? Enjoy? Oh, I don't understand, Mr. Krabs."
"You got it, Mr. Krabs. My lips are sealed."
"Gosh, Mr. Krabs, I've never tried to make chum before. I don't even know what the ingredients are."
"Eww.  Um, I don't think I can make that for you, Mr. Krabs, but I can make you some chum-free chum. You won't even be able to tell the difference."
Behold: three takes on chum à la SpongeBob.  The secret ingredient in this one? Krabby Patties. Well? Huh?
"To capture the natural bouquet of the chum, I made this batch entirely from old snail litter."
"Ooh, I think you'll like this one.  I know I do.  It's made from wishes and love."
"Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Oh, when I can't sleep, I come here to be close to the formula. It comforts me."
"I can't let you do that, Mr. Krabs.  You'll thank me for this later.  Okay.  Gotta get a better grip.  Okay, okay."
"Wait, Mr. Krabs! Plankton is tiny. It'll take him forever to swim through that chum.  You can get to the formula before him, but you're gonna have to eat like the wind."
"Whoo!  Go, Mr. Krabs, go! Whoo!  No, don't fill up on bread! The chum! Eat the chum!"
"Mr. Krabs, you did it! You saved the secret formula."
"Hey, where'd Plankton go?"
What should we do while we wait?
"Mm, could you pass the popcorn?"
"Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!"
Suit yourself.
"Silly, that's not my bathroom."
"Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?"
Yeah!  We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair?
"Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out."
"Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings.  Oh, somebody's tense!"
"Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight."
"Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!"
"Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive."
"Plankton, in a word: yes!"
"All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this.  After you."
"All right, Plankton. Now you try!"
Try this one.
"Plankton, no!"
"Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice."
Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice.
Say something nice.
"No, try again."
"Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you."
"No, I think we better try something else."
"Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!"
"Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart."
That wasn't even close to what I said.
"Okay, I feel uncomfortable."
"Plankton, are you sure about this?"
"Oh, I like that!  Boop beep! Beep boop boop!"
Beep boop!
"Thank you!  Ow!  I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!"
"Plankton, I don't want to eat this!"
"Oh, Plankton-poo, you say the sweetest things!"
Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!
"You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies."
Yeah!
"Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me."
"Oh, that is so sweet!"
I'm gonna go now.
"I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh...  Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No!  Come on, don't ever do that! Come on!  No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it!"
"Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!"
Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass!
This must be the night driving part of the test.
"Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town."
"Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants."
"That depends, did I pass?"
Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive.
"Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt."
"Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head!  Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail."
"Alright, put the money in the bag!  Put it in!"
"Alright, give me the money!"
"Uhh, savings."
Sure.  Here ya go.
Oh.
"Well, that went better than expected."
"Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time."
"Look, Patrick, there she is!  Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!"
"SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob.  We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff!"
"Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here.  No, wait!  There goes our deposit on these costumes."
"Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!"
"No, it's really me!  I brought Patrick along too."
'Cause we're gonna set you free!
"He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees."
"That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!"
"Oh, that's crazy, Patrick."
But why?
"Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff.  Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison."
"We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom."
"Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!"
"Psst!  Hop in, Mrs. Puff."
"Mrs. Puff, up here."
"Made of sponge!  I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test!"
"No! What are you doing? Help! Help!  No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal!"
"What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?"
Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh!
"Patrick, I'm going to be a spy."
In my hands?  Ooh...
"Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick!"
"Hey, Sandy."
"Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?"
"Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies!"
"What do we do now, Patrick?"
Nothing yet. Wait! Wait!! He's...  ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.
"Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes?"
SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.
Plankton just bought some baby clothes.
Hold on.  He's buying...
A... stamp.
"We're right behind him, and he has no idea!"
I can't tell.
"He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-pack!"
"Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!"
"Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield..."
Agent SpongeBob here.
"I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs."
"You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs."
"Okay, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?"
"Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside."
"Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn!  I thought you were holding the rope --"
"Ohhh, can't you go later?"
"It's up to you and me, buddy!"
"Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose."
Mr. Krabs?!
"But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's...  Mr. Krabs is a robot!"
Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here!?
Squidward!  Then-then who are you!?
"Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be...  Sandy?!"
You're me! Then I must be...
"Nah, I'm just kidding."
"Good one, Patrick!  There's just one thing I don't understand..."
That.
"Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SKIING!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!"
"They taste even better.  Hi, Mr. Krabs."
"Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?"
Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
Really?
"Ee-hee, ooh...!"
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together!  How can I ever repay you?"
All I have is 5.
"I'll be right back.  Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?"
"Thanks, Mr. Krabs."
"Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty."
"Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?"
Am I a pretty girl?
"But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through.  Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up."
I'm not?
Yep.
Nope.
Uh-uh.
Nope.
What is it?
Seems a little dangerous.
Ooh...
"No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though."
"Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list!"
How do you know my name?! Who are you?!
Cursed?
What guy?
Smitty what?
He must've been number one.
Immediately?
To its owner?
Right now?
"Hey, Mr. Krabs."
I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
"It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1!"
"Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets."
"You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess!"
"It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-"
Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand.
"Well, Patrick, I guess...  I did."
"Me too, Patrick, me too!  Oh, Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be..."
"Patrick, that's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!"
How about now?
"...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter.  The rest of my things are right over there."
"Oh, and quarter, thanks!  Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys?  Guys?"
I had always preferred to recycle.
SpongeBob SquarePants!
Funny you should ask... once I had...
Yeah. I could use a nap.
This camp is very upscale!
"It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!"
"This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?"
It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights.
The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.
That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters!
Uh... abomination?
"Me, sir!"
"It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration!"
Cool!
All done!
Really?
"Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee?"
♪--and you--♪
"Uh... Hey, guys! What are you doing?"
You first.
Me too!
"Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward."
Do you know what today is?
"No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month."
What do you mean?
"That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder."
"Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile."
Huh?
Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!
Making...Krabby Patties?
Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
"That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of..."
"No, Squidward!"
An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!
"But, sir…"
"Crystal, sir!"
I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.
You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!
That can be arranged.
"Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row."
I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
"Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!"
"Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!"
"Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me."
"Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?"
Nope!  Nighty Night.
"Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?"
"All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!"
Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!
"Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!"
Truce.
You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.
"And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!"
As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
"Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!"
"Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!"
"It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!"
"Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!"
"So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?"
"Huh?  No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Not the patties! I'll save you!
"Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?"
"Good luck, Mr. Krabs!"
"Yes, sir. I see the problem."
"But, Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?"
"Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie."
"Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula.  Hair! Hair! I got to go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton."
"Okay, bye!"
"Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula."
"Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside."
"Bye, Gary!"
"Gary, I'm home!"
"What happened here?  My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren!  My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times!  My glass of water!  I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!"
Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
"Gary, did you do this?"
"What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?"
"Something's not right, Gary."
I'd better get you to the vet.
"Hey, it's Plankton."
Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
"Hello? Hello!  Huh? The line’s been cut.  Barnacles!  I guess I’d go better take a look.   Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ha, hey!  Aha, wind-up novelty teeth! How did you wind up down here? Dahaha!  What the heck is going on with my fancy boot?  Hey, knock it off!  Alright, I warned you!  You're a dirty fighter... I got you now! Hiya!  Gary?  Noooooooooo!  Gary!  Hooa!  Phew! Thank goodness. For a minute, I thought you were hurt.   Gary, I've - I've broke your shell."
"Oh no, you're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better.  Sorry about that. Oh, I know,  here, just use a little tape and there ya go, good as new!  Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya.  SpongeBob"
"Yeah, you're right, too gaudy.  No, too last season.  Well, I need that. Ahahaha, look, Gary!  Here, try this on for size."
"Of course it's a shell.  Aw, come on, don't look at me like that."
"Okay, you're right, it's not a shell.  Oh!  Greetings, earthling, I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. Dahahaha.  I bet this'll look great. . Ew. I can see why snail shells aren't clear.  Hmmm."
"Here it is, Gary, your new shell!  Oh, you look ready to ride.  Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy?"
"Oh, page 72. Here it is - wow! . This stylish fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic rest-room facilities standard, and for the affordable price of just... 9595.95!? Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune?"
Commercial? What commercial?
"Oh, sorry, Angry Jack. Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?"
"Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy?  Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy?"
"Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it. But first I've gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy?  Oops. Hey, what about that one?  Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one?"
"Good idea, Angry."
"Well, it certainly is shiny."
"Oh, that is bright.  Can't... see! Ow, what was that? S'cuse me.  Why – can't – I – stop – breaking – shells!  Whoops. Say, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me?"
"Wait, wait, wait. Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first,  shoes are tied. Hands are dry.  And now, a thick layer of bubble wrap.  You, um, you sure you don't have any more in the back?"
"Well, look on the bright side. I reduced your inventory for you."
Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?
"Take it, it's all my savings."
"Sorry, that's all I got. Honest."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages.  Hey, I've got an idea!"
"Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody!  Oh, who am I kidding? It looks terrible on you! I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!?"
"Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?"
"I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement, so I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug!"
"Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary."
"Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke."
"Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year."
Deal!  Another bad dream.  Aaargh!  Mr. Krabs?
"Sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell."
"There ya go, Mr. Krabs."
"Ahh. I guess all's shell that ends shell, huh, Gary? Dahahah! That's a good one.  Gary?  Gary?  Gary?"
"Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary.  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later."
"Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today."
I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
"Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?"
You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!
"Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime."
"Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning."
"No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning."
"I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'til 9."
Late for being early!
"And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom."
And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.
"Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are."
"Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74."
"I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project."
"The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes... Roger would die."
Patrick!
The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
This is gonna be great!
"You, Patrick, she's the teacher."
I guess it's just in the timing.
"Hey, Patrick."
I thought of something funnier than 24.
...25.
"Yes, Mrs. Puff."
"Big Fat Meanie!?! Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!"
No...
I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!!
"NOOOO!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
"What, me? But why?"
"Thanks a lot, Patrick."
"Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?"
"Just ignore him, SpongeBob."
"Whatever you do, don't look at him."
What?!?!
HIIIIIIIIIIIIII?!?!?!
"There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!"
"Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, CONSIDERING YOU ARE ONE!"
It is after class!
They're talking about us! We're fighting!
Detention!?
"In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick."
I'd hate you no matter what.
I'd hate you even if that made sense.
"I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?"
Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!
"I'm sorry, your apology is so long!"
I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet!
"Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth.  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!"
"We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!"
"Patrick, this is your rock. I was waiting for you. How was your first day at work?"
"Oh, you poor little sea star. Tell you what, buddy—Tomorrow, I'll come with you to work and help out."
"I'll show you.  If you put arm arms behind you, I can be your hands."
I'll do the scoopin'.
I'll do the countin'.
"Yeah, I'm not doing that."
Ta-da!
"Hello, folks! I'm Edible Edie! Start with my head!"
"Oh, I'd love to.  But if I don't hurry, I'll be late for my job. Sure you can handle that ice cream all... by yourself?  Silly question.  Good luck, my employed pal."
"I demand the release of this poor woodland creature. He's got rights too, you know."
Hooray!
"Vegetables! That's what you like, isn't it, bunny? We'll see what we got in the fridge."
"Whoops, I'm out of veggies. But I got something even better.  Gary's food! Yay!  Does bunny wunny like his dinny winny?"
"All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back."
Bunny wunny! I've got a surprise for you—
I'm gonna have to chew-proof this whole house fast!  Hot sauce ought to do the trick.
"Huh? No, no, no, no!"
My comic books!
I gotta get rid of all that hot sauce.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Here we are! Water supply—check. Trampoline for hopping—check. Buckteeth sharpener—check. And an adding machine for multiplying.  Triple check-aroonie! Now the bunny will be more than happy to stay in his cage. Huh?
Doesn't like cage...  Check.
"No, no, bunny, don't go in there! You'll get lost! I need my jellyfishing net. Where did I put that thing?  Probably dropped it in here somewhere. Nyah, nyah—ah, got it!"
"Patrick, did you fall between the cushions again?"
"No, no! No, don't! Please don't! That's my— All right, Patrick, that's enough hunting. You can come out now."
"Stay where you are, Patrick! I've got an idea. To the pet shop!"
Thank you!  Patrick! I bought a second bunny to lure the first bunny out of hiding.
"Hold still, Patrick, I see you."
"One, two... Three?"
Yay!
"Uh-oh.  Patrick, the hunt is on!"
"Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!"
"Don't worry, Squidward."
"Sorry about your house, Squidward."
What do we have to do?
Act normal?
"Uh, natural greeting to you, friend."
Would you like to have some natural fun?
Naturally.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?
"Oh, can I have an A plus?"
Pretty please with sugar on top?
Whoo!
We got an A plus!
"Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or, or expose us to gamma rays?"
Easy sneezy!
Sandy!
We're back!
"We sure are, buddy!"
"Aye-aye, Captain Sandy."
"Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?"
"So what's it gonna be, boss?"
You're in charge.
One.
Ahem.
Three.
Forty-seven. Forty-seven?
Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven.
"Okay, boss man. How do you wanna do it?"
How about you count the white and I count the black sand?
"One, two, three, four, five. six,..."
You're the boss!
Do you wanna trade?
"Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big."
What's that?
"Patrick, you call that fair?"
Uh... Oh. Yeah.
"But, Patrick, I..."
Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?
"Oh, come on!"
"Alright, I'll rub your feet."
Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!
"Patrick, you are making very poor choices!"
"Alright, I will!"
"One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, one-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three."
Done! Now to count the black sand.
"Aaaah!  Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?"
Would you like sprinkles on it?
You open it!
"No, you open it!"
But we didn't even finish counting the sand!
"Et tu, Gary?"
"Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk."
"Oh, yeah!"
"Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream."
"You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary!"
"It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger,  and bigger, and— ow!"
"Hey Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud."
"You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all.  Let's see what's inside.  Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite-sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!"
"A great fortune has fallen upon you.  Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future.  Happy trails will follow you always.  Your fortune came true too!"
Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!
"Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one."
"Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?"
All right!
Those fortune cookies are a hit.
Time for a refill.
"Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs."
"Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before.  Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck."
"If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true!"
Mr. Krabs! No!
"Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, it's time.  It's time to give up the secret formula to Plankton!  Because your life is worth more than some scrap of paper in a bottle."
"Leave it to me, Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours.  Hot stuff comin' through!"
"Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this."
"Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ...would want."
"Hi, neighbor!"
Should we take it from the top?

You did what?!!

I'm ready!
"Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom."
"Oh, cause you're the mascot."
"Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays!"
Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimic.
"Great idea, Squidward!"
"Ohh, what is this?"
"I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune."
So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
"Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do."
"No, you need to turn yourself in."
Who's that?
What?
Really?
Now you've gone too far!
I can't believe you're calling me that!
"Patrick, what are you eating?"
Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
"Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution."
"My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too."
"Oh, boy! Road trip!  I hope it lasts forever."
Old Man Jenkins' farm?
Ooh.  Yoo-hoo! Whee!
"Farm hand! Oh, boy!"
Huh? Potatoes?
"Oh, boy! We can be farming buddies."
"Oh, we're not just any dern fools."
"Oh, boy. What's first?"
"Ooh, shiny."
"Uh, coochie coo-coochie…"
"Okay, that didn't work."
Patrick!
"Well, that was egg-citing."
Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy?  That tickles.
"Uh, could somebody hand me those?"
Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.
"Ha, this will be a snap."
That'll take forever!
But I don't have a tractor license.
"Wow, Patrick. You're really good at this."
"Hold on, buddy.  I got it.  Hyah!  Whoops.  Got it."
"Hey, this is fun."
Whoo-hoo!
"Did I bail out too soon?  Oh, boy! Our chores are all done. It's time for the..."
Don't you worry your little wrinkly head. 'Cause we're gonna have an old fashioned barn raising.
'A' is for Amoeba. 'B' is for Blobfish.
Congratulations on your barn-mitzvah. Today you are a man-barn.
"Aw, they grow up so fast."
"Perfect!  Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is?"
Nope! It's time to...
"When are your other guests coming, Old Man Jenkins?"
"Oh, I think the party's over."
How did you guys know about the barn dance?
Invitation? What invitation?
Hmm? Wow.
"Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them!"
Annihilate safely.
"Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens."
"Gee, you think we just imagined it?"
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens."
Mmm-hey!
Hey!
Hey!
"Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?"
I'd say you've certainly got a real nutmare on your hands.
"Yes, ma'am!"
Whoa. Who are you?
"Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob."
"Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's."
Meant to be eatin' eh?
Wow. It's coming in great.
Even better!
Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham.
Wow! Patrick would wanna try this.
"Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able."
"Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick."
Oh no! The nuts stopped!
"Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!"
The tree got real sick!
"Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!"
Shalmon?
"Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. My buns are nice and toasty."
"You're welcome, Squidward."
Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
"That's why I wore mittens.  Mm, toasty!"
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!  Pardon me!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Can do, Mr. Krabs!"
Order up!
"Coming right up, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Coming through!  Hi, Patrick!"
Holy shrimp! Plankton!
"Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me first."
"You're mine now, Plankton!  You won't get away with this, Plankton!"
"Oh, my weekend was fabulous! Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug!  Swallowed a bug."
Hey!
"Hold it right there, mister!"
"Gotcha, Plankton!"
The clamboni! Run for it!
"Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs."
"Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs."
"Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir!"
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!"
"Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪"
♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪
"Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs."
"Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?"
Morning! Hm?  I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.
"Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!"
"Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming."
"Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy."
Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting...strange?
Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.
Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to... the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.
"So, we threw you a surprise party."
"Of course not, Mr. Krabs."
"Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?"
Ooh.
"Hey, Timmy! I've found your ball. And... Your sister."
"A thousand pardons, Sir Sea Tiger."
And the elephant says...  Weee!!!  The giraffe goes...  And the baboon says...  And the zookeeper goes...
These little cuties are dangerous?  Don't be silly.
For me? Thanks!
Got it.
"Yes, sir. I'll go."
I-I just want to pet the critters. Does that make me an animal?
My own zoo? That's a laugh.  Ooh...  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Voilà! Our first zoo animals.
Don't be a dope. Try extra strength soap.
"Ooh, look at 'em, Patrick. So happy and healthy.  Oh, and look, Patrick! Bubble droppings!"
No more buts. We need more animals!
Welcome to the Bubble Zoo! Where the price of admission is a smile.  Just a second you.  That's better.
"Gather around, folks, and meet the animals! These wild bubble-phants never forget to have fun.  These bubble-raffes are necking. And they have the necks for it.  Ooh, time to feed the sea monsters.  Ooh! Alley-zoop!  Come and get it!"
"Hey, Squidward! I see you're playing with my sea monsters. Isn't my bubble zoo fun?"
"Okay.  Oh, Maggie.  Tickle, tickle. Let's put Squidward down.  Wow! Aww!"
"Squidward, don't forget to bring it back!  Nice bubble beasts. Uh, let's make you some more enclosures, huh?"
"Stop those animals, Patrick! Go!"
"They've gone wild, Patrick! Wild!"
They must've heard my uvula!
You guys saved our lives!
"I promise you won't regret it, Mr. Zookeeper, sir.  I'm free again!  Weee!!  Good morning, Squidward!"
"What's the matter, buddy? You seem so sad."
My hat is sad?
"First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?"
"Oof!  Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip,  but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it."
"Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area?  Hey, Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?"
"That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar-"
Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.
"Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far."
What're you doing out there?
You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
"Let her go, Patrick!"
The Dirty Bubble?!
"What now, Patrick?"
"Wha, no, Patrick!"
"Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?"
"What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?"
Not for long!
"Tag, you're it."
I know! What if both of us are it?
Exactly! Neither of us will know!
I'm it!
"Whoa, what is this place?"
Let's go back to the main deck.
"Patrick!  I'm coming, buddy! Patrick?  Patrick!"
"Wow, what's this?  Mauna Loa.  Oh, I'm late! Gotta get to work!"
"♪Mauna Loa, how I love ya, oh, my secret lovin' hideaway! My Mauna Loa bay-a bay!♪"
"Oh, that's just my secret—  Here you go."
"Whew, that was a close one!"
"Patrick, please! What are you trying to do?! Give away our secret hideout?! Give me that!"
"Uh, sorry, sir."
"Sure thing.  Arr! Oh, looks like the work day's over. See you tomorrow, sir!"
"Come on, Patrick. We've got to get back to our playground."
"Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?"
Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?
"Just as I thought. We're being followed. That's it!  Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!"
"Hey, were you following us?"
"I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret."
"If my eyes weren't burning like they were full of lava, I could show you."
"Uh, you might want to take a closer look at your coinage."
"Ahoy, Mr. Krabs! Maybe they hid the loot off ship in that shed!"
"Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth."
And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?
"Captain's Quarters. There must be some treasure here, Mr. Krabs!"
"Remember, you're always welcome back at the secret hideout."
"Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!"
"It's gone, Patrick. Our secret paradise is gone forever!"
How 'bout another ride to cheer you up?
That was awesome!
"Well, Patrick, I guess we really lost our secret hideout this time."
"Oh, who knows, Patrick? The next fun, fun place might be just around the corner, huh?"
"The Real Mauna Loa? Ooh, Patrick, do you want to keep a secret?"
"I got it, I got it! Coming!"
"Front end... check. Antenna...  check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker...  ...check.  Tire pressure!  ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!"
I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
"Well, yeah, but..."
"Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me."
Huh?
"Right, back... it up."
"Okay, okay!"
"Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse! Right... uhh...?!?!?!"
BACKING UP! BACKING UUUUPPPPP!
Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up!  Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up...  ...backing up.
And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Well... we can still deliver it on foot.
The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
"Shh, shh, shh. It's working."
Truck! Sixteen wheels! Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked.  WheeeeEEEEEeeee... eeeEEEEEeee...
The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza  is the pizza free delivery! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty.
"I can't, it's for the customer!"
I do!
Squidward!
No!
No! It's for the customer!
No!
I think town's this way.
That's right.  Moss always points to civilization.
Yep.
"Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think..."
"The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally.  pizza...  pizza...  Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and  me-eeeeee-eee-ee-eeeeeeeeeee!!  Krab Pizza... for you... Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside..."
"I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral.  No, maybe it wasn't coral...  ...maybe it was sand... no, no, mud."
"Wait, I remember now. It was coral!"
"No, we promised it's for the customer."
Yeah!
Well?
"Okay, it's fine!"
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah...
"...wait a second! I know what you're trying to do, Squidward!  I'm not letting you eat the pizza!"
No!
Get away!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
"Look, we're saved!"
"No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved!"
"Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!  Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!"
"It's not just a boulder!!  It's a rock!  A ro-ha-hock! A ra-ha-ha-ha-HA-hock! It's a big beautiful, old rock.  Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape."
I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face!
"Congratulations, sir, your Krabby Patty pizza is here!"
What drink?
But... you didn't order any drink.
But... but...
Did he change his mind?
No drink?
Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work!
This isn't happening. This isn't happening!
"The horror, it's unspeakable!  Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!"
"The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone."
"Mr. Krabs, you're here!  Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs."
"Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh good, I thought you were hurt."
"Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?"
"I'm serious, Squidward."
We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again.
"That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea.  Thanks for coming with me, Patrick."
I've never seen so many mattresses.
How many do you think there are?
Cool.
Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress.
"Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy."
"We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress."
Mr. Krabs!
"Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?"
"We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us."
"Terrific, Patrick, you found it!"
"Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm."
"Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it."
"Because that would be rude, Patrick."
"Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here."
"Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here."
"Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!"
Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.
Understood. Out.
Understood. Out.
Affirmative.
"Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'."
"I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick!"
"Yes, Patrick?"
"Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm!"
"Wow, I think you're right, Patrick."
"Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy!"
We feel silly.
"Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?"
Steak sauce?
"Happy Halloween, Squidward!"
"Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!"
"Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!"
"Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?"
"♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, It's gonna be a good one, just wait and see. Jumped out of bed and I ran outside, feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪"
"Hey, Gary!"
"Why is this the best day ever?, you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital! I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode!  ♪It's the best day ever♪"
♪It's the best day ever♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
"But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab! Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave!  Ohhhh! Guys, you're ruining the  best day...  Wait, no.  Best day...  Huh?"
Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's!  Wait ‘til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah!  Hyah!
"Oh, just a little something I like to call karate!"
"Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then. I'll come back later."
Yeah?
"Oh.  Oh, no Krabby Patties, no karate. But at least I still have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now!  Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new...  What's wrong, Patrick?"
"Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net."
"Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new..."
"Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net."
"Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now.  Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now.  I guess I'll see you at the concert.  It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good.  No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers.  Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?"
"Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!"
Now play!
I said play!
Now get in there and give me a concert to remember!
I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever!
"One ticket, coming right up, cap'n!  Must be here somewhere.  I don't have a ticket."
But...
"SpongeBob, you are so..."
A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down and...  NOOOOOO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over!
This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything...  SIT DOWN!  Then everything turned to doo-doo.
"No, it's not okay!  This was gonna be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab."
"Yeah, I guess so. But then I was gonna do karate with Sandy."
"Well, I suppose. But then I was gonna go jellyfishing with Patrick."
It's not?
It is?
You do?
"♪My perfect job starts my perfect day.♪  ♪Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.♪"
♪Sing along. Hear that happy sound♪
♪That's where it's at!♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
♪It's the best day ever♪
Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table 9.
"Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?"
The hooks?
What could be worse than that?!
"Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs!"
"Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!"
"Hey, Patrick."
I can't leave now. I'm working.
Where is everybody?
"Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks! Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!"
"All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!"
"But, Mr. Krabs said..."
"Patrick, don't!"
"Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back! Oh, my best friend!  Patrick, you're alive!"
"But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?"
Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
"Well, no."
I guess he didn't!
Ready?
This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab!
Again!
I...I...I...
Gift shop?
"Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs."
"I'M READY!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, I'm ready..."
I always go to work this way.
"But, Patrick, we promised."
"You don't have any fingers, Patrick."
But Mr. Krabs said...
Umm...
"Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no. Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm hooked. And that means...  AAAAAHHH!!! HELP!! I'M HOOKED! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!"
"Psst, Mr. Krabs."
"Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?"
"Umm...no.  I mean yes! Yes, you told me not to go near them!"
"Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! YES I DID IT! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me.  I'm hooked!"
What am I gonna do?
"Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls!  D’oh, okay! I'm taking 'em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There."
"Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs! I can't do it. Anything but that!"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise!  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!  Whew!"
The pants! The underwear!
Can I make a Krabby Patty now?
Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?
POOP?
"Oh, POOP!"
Krabby Patty!
I'm ready!  I'm ready!!  I'm ready!!  I'm ready!!!
"Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?"
Can I make a Krabby Patty now-
"Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty."
"Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard."
Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose!
"Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty.."
I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted!
"Uh... Plankton, sir?"
"Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!"
Plankton? What do you want?
Um... no.
No.
I... guess so.
Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
A booster seat?
You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!
"You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!"
"Good night, Gary."
Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today.
"Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!"
Help!
Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?
Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!
"No! No, never!  You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula!"
"No, no, no!  There's no one here."
I must fight!
"I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down,  you delicate little Krabby Patty."
"With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness."
"I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns."
"Well, patty, I guess we can go home now."
"I'm ready! I'm rea...  Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture,  itchy scalp...  it's a wig!  Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?"
Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
"Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!"
It's okay.  Why did you do that?
"Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea."
It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
"Why, thank you."
"Hi, Squidward!"
"Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?"
I'm wearing a wig.
Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
"If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you."
"Wig away!  Order up, Squidward."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs."
"Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy."
"Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face."
"Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs."
"I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?"
"Glad you like it.  I'll see you later, Sandy.  Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good."
You know it.
"Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs."
"This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me."
"Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too."
"Thank you, Squidward."
I don't understand.
"Hello, handsome.  Sss."
"Hmmm, I've never been tall before."
That tickles!
I think that it looks cool.
"For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is."
"But, Mr. Krabs..."
So I can't have a wig or a butt?
"Hi, Sandy. What do you think?"
Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody.
I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
"Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.  and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me."
Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie!
"People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot."
"I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too."
"I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!"
"No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again."
"Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere."
Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
"Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool."
"Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?"
I wish I had a wig.
"Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?"
"Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it?  I made this part out of..."
"Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert!  Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom."
"No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?"
"What is it, Gary? What do you have?  Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea!  Long.  Tan.  Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this!"
"Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo."
"Well, I guess the first thing we should do is..."
Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture.
Be right there.
Just a second. Coming!  Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...!  That'll be a keeper.
Prom expert; away!
"Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!"
What is it?
"Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy!"
That just didn't happen. Let's go!  Ready?
"The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one."
"Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet!  Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry.  Whatever you do, don't..."
— Messed everything up.
— Hot dog!
All I wanted was to have a good time!
Can I still wear the wig?
Let's go!
"Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned."
"Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! ."
"May I help you, sir?"
As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.
How will that help them chew faster?
"No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table."
Why did you give him the table?
I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out?  What do you have against old people?
Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?
I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.
I really have to pee.
Hello... money.
I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs.
"Mr. Krabs, lookin' good."
I don't know. He's acting kind of weird.
"Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane."
"Okay, glad you're not insane."
He was five bucks short on payday.
"Hi, Squidward! Bet you can't guess what movie we're gonna see!"
That's okay. I'll tell you.
It's Fisher...
Patrick and I are gonna see Fisherman 4!
"Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys."
Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie.
I wish we had a flashlight.
"Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting!"
Sorry.  So isn't too scary.  The Fisherman's hook! Get off the teeter totter!
The Fisherman's got him!
"Hold on, I'll take a peek."
"Patrick, it's okay."
"Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Aww, the movie's over."
"Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through.  Okay. Keep your eyes open."
"Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open."
D'ohhhh!
Must close eyes! Too scary!
"Oh, no, we missed the movie."
"It's okay, we'll just see the next one."
"Wow. Uh, what time is it?"
One... minute... to midnight?!
"Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!"
Phew. We made it.
Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
"Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow."
"No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door."
I think it's coming from over there.
"Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there.  Just a few steps that away.  In the dark? All alone?"
"Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?"
"Oh, hey, Squidward."
We're too scared.
"Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend."
"Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you."
"Oh, yeah. Here."
Patrick! Are you okay?
I think so! Good night!
"Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!"
"Who's here? Hold on, let me get up.  Your face!"
Now who's here?
You just said.
The Fisherman!
Quick. Block the door.
Get everything?
Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
"Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)"
"I guess this is the end, old buddy."
Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.
"And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah."
That thing's eating Squidward!
"Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window.  Okay! I think you got it!   Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore."
The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?
Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward! Help!
"Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house!"
"PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!"
Gary!
"It's okay, Gary."
"Goodnight, Gary."
"Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?"
"Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks."
Eeeh.
"Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all."
You just gotta scare someone other than me.
"Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all."
"Sure, relax a little."
"Hey, champ! How's it..."
What is going on around here?
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!"
Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
"Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now."
A journey into self-awareness.
"Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious.  Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?"
Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
Now he's got him.
Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems!  ...goblins...guilt trip...
"Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!"
"And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon."
Good Ol' Dutchie!
"Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch!"
"Huh?   Good job, Gary!  I love you, Gary!  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!  Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha!"
For what?
That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
"Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?"
Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello!
I love Gary!
"I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick."
"Actually, a three day weekend."
"Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand."
You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.
"Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night."
"Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?"
Gary.
"See you later, Patrick."
Gary! I'm home!
Squidward! What are you doing here?
"What a great friend you are, Squidward."
"Thanks, Squidward.  I can always count on you.  Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward!"
What?
"I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?"
Aren't you going to do it?
"Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too."
Gary!
"Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady.  Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again."
"Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma."
What's going to happen to me?
"I don't know, I feel kind of funny!"
"Oh, Gary, you're better!"
"Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!"
"Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?"
"Here ya go. Eat up, Gary."
"Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?"
"No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top!"
"Gary, you're getting a  lot faster!"
Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine!
Gary... I'm fine!
"Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see.  That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway!"
"Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes!  I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee  ow!"
Meow!
Meow! Meow.
Meow!  Meow. Meow.  Meow!  Meow. Meow.
"Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  ."
"Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  ."
"Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  ."
"Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  ."
"Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick?"
"Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz!"
Let's show him
Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?
I see what you mean.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
"Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab."
I guess I hadn't thought about that.
"Oh. It's okay, little green... creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest  restaurant in Bikini Bottom!"
"And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating!"
I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation.
"Mustard, mustard, step right up for your mustard!  Some mustard for you. Eh, eh, eh."
A bit of the yellow for you. Doy.
"Oh, okay.  Eh.  And a Mr. Mustard for you."
Hyah!
"Hang on, folks, I'll be right back with more mustard.  Whoo!  Let's see. Ketchup.  Mayonnaise.  Oh, mustard."
What?
"But Squidward, without mustard I wouldn't be able to make a—"
Cursed?
You got out and you're alive.
"Ah, his foot's gone!"
Whoa.
I'll check.  Wahhh!  Don't bother jumping. That shaft has no bottom. Let's take the escalator.
Coal miners.
Ew.
Phew.
Unaccompanied minors.
"Hey, I found something yellow.  Never mind, it's just gold."
This must be the Mummy's Curse that old guy was talking about.
"The greatest treasure of all, a child."
Hello?
"On the way, sir, as soon was we find it.  Love you."
"Hurry up, Squidward, before the doors close!"
Do you have a metro card?
"Come on, Squidward!"
"Faster, Squidward, faster!"
"Oh, that's our stop."
Hot sauce.
We're getting close.  Oh.  Mustard. Ahhh! I struck mustard!
"Oh, no, what are we gonna do now?"
It's the Mummy's Curse guy!
"Oh, I get it, 'cause the mummy wants the mustard. Mystery solved."
"Oh, no curse. No mummy. And no mustard.  And I'll have to find another job!"
"You were right, Squidward, you're not gonna hurt him."
"Go, Squidward, you're winning! You're not hurting him at all!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Whoa....!"
Wow! Yee-ha! Yeah!
Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.
"Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock.  He had a lump on his head—"
"Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—"
"Hi, Plankton. Nice dress."
"I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round.  Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master."
"Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music."
"Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own."
"Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing doorslam and I was wondering if I could—Squidward: Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!"
Whoo! I wanna play!
"Ouch, Squidward, this game is fun!"
"He's right, officer. Plankton doesn't even play clar—"
"Boy, that was a close one, huh, Squidward? He almost got your clarinet."
"I—I—  Oh, good morning, everyone."
"I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?"
"Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up.  See?  Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again."
"Oh, my clock!"
"Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together.  It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it."
"Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you.  Wow!"
"Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way."
"Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and—  Well, okay, are you sure?"
"Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all."
"Um, hello?"
Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?
"Wow. So many to choose from.  Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. I'll just take 'em all!"
"My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works.  Goodnight, Gare-bear."
Huh?
I hope this one works.
Huh?
"Oh, I don't know how many more or elses I can take.  I have to figure out a way to wake up on time."
"Hey, what a great idea!"
Good morning...
"Just five more minutes, Gary."
"Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs."
Time for or else?
"Uh, what?  No!"
"Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!"
"Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!"
"Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash."
"Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! Up with bubbles, down with air!  Nematodes are people too!  Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a ."
"Well, sometimes, but not... Recently."
"Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?"
"Nah-uh, not that word, that word."
Sentence enhancers?
"Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?"
"How  right you are, Patrick!"
"Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation."
It tingles when I laugh!
"Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh?"
"Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?"
"Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.  And don't forget to ask us to  the  fries. It will be our  pleasure.  Hi, Squidward, how the  are ya?"
"But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers."
You mean ?
"Wow, 13."
"Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!"
"Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators."
"Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes!"
Darn.
"Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators!   Eels again."
"Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!  Eels?"
"Escalators, escalators, escalators!  Ha! Escalators!"
"Ah, !"
"I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!"
"No, wait, Patrick!  Patrick, no, please don't tell!"
Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
I can run faster than you!
"Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!"
"Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!"
"He said, he said, he said!"
"Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things."
"Well, he said..."
"Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said."
...number thirteen...
We'll probably get 40 lashes!
"I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that."
"Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs."
"Five, six, seven..."
"That's all thirteen, Patrick!  We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice !"
"And he-- --Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!"
"♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo!  ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done.  In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen such a perfect group of patties. Especially— you.  Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?"
"Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything."
"Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: That which is fried, must be eaten."
"No, I won't let you do this to Patty."
"Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing."
Great idea.
"Enjoy, sir."
"What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!"
"It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell."
"Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out."
"Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready."
"Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way."
"♪Oh, baby, They may call me a fool, But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat, Ba-ay-ay-by!♪  ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue.♪ Whoo! ♪Oh, baby! There isn't anything.

"Good day, sir."
"Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date."
She's rich in taste.
There she is.
"Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town."
"Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty."
"This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the manager's treatment, do you?"
"Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different."
How about now?
"Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?"
"Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie."
"Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?"
"Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea."
"Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?"
"Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs."
"I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love."
Can I get a doggie bag with that?
Patrick! Happy Best Friend... whoa.
"Patrick, I am truly honored and..."
"You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that."
"Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum."
"No, not at all."
"O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you.  Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this! With a little karate! Hyah!  Whew! Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza.  Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick."
"I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go!  Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never!"
"No way, Patrick."
"Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up!  Isn't this a cute look?"
"Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast.  Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy!"
Ahhh...!
"Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy, 'cause he is so attractive!  Allow me to demonstrate.  See, Patrick? The view is beautiful down here!"
"Thanks.  Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous!"
"Wishful thinking, Gary. What burglar would want to steal that thing?  Shhh."
"Uh, up there?"
Sandy?
"Hi, Sandy. Looks like I got myself into a pretty sticky situation."
All day.
"No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets."
Told ya.
"Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like... me!"
"Yeah, alrighty."
"Patrick, I have something to tell you."
"Uh, well, how can I put this?"
"Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?"
"Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?"
"It's yours, buddy. But first, you gotta get us out of this."
"Mr. Krabs, I came as soon as I got the call!"
"Aye aye, captain."
But Sandy said-
Mr. Krabs.
Patty... becoming... awkward...
Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?
"So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?"
"Sorry, Squidward. Coming right up!  Order up, Squidward!"
You betcha!
Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one.  There we go.
"Squidward, why did you make that weird noi-  Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen!  Nooooooo! Huh?  Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!"
"Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward, behind you!  Abandon ship!"
"Mr. Krabs, look out!"
"Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!"
Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant Krabby Patty!
Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!
That wasn't a dream!
"We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!"
"She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy, where are you?"
Sandy?
"Wow, what happened to your treedome?"
"What's wrong, Patrick? Airsickness?"
Really? How?
Direct contact!? Are you sure?
"Okay, bye."
"Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait, what was I supposed to do again?"
"Direct contact, you mean like this?"
Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain.
"Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body, come to think of it!"
Ok...what do I do now?
Copy that. Over.
"Hey, Pearl!"
"Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend."
"Bye, Pearl! Tell Mr. Krabs I said Hi, Let's bounce Patrick. Patrick?"
"Oh! I'm a single rider!  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me!"
"After you, fellow single rider Pearl."
"Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat."
"I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
"And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!"
You're supposed to remain seated until the ride's come to a COMPLEEETE-  Stop!
"It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for . Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS."
"Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness."
"Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... Snakes!"
Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.
"Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and..."
...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES!
Or ghostly pirates!   Or laboratory creatures!
Or green beings from another planet!
Or bus drivers!
Shhh. Did you hear that?
It sounded like a crawly were-clown.
"Oh, he's here."
"A ha ha ha, he."
What was that?
Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!
Wow! How romantical.
"Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub.  Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil!"
What's that?
Yeah.
Crawly clown! Crawly clown!
Whoa!
"Oh, thanks for that, Mrs. Puff, I—"
"Ooh! You're talking to Sandy? Mrs. Puff, tell her I said, Hi! Tell her I said, Hi! Tell her I said, Hi!"
"Tell her I said, Hi!"
"Tell her I said, Hi!"
"Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, Hi!"
Huh? C-coming!
Hello? Can I help you?
"Oh, uh, thanks— My driver's license!"
"My new boat!  Whoa, wow!  Am I dreaming?  Nope, it's for real.  Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving!"
"Wha-what? Whoa!  Whoa! Ow!  Hm, those are some potholes."
"Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals."
"Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving!  Look, I got a license.  Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road!  near a construction site]"
Now I'm flying!  Whee!
"Huh? Huh? Huh.  Huh?  Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly... Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever!"
"Huh? Oh, you girls got me again!  Vroom! Vroom!"
"Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving!"
Sorry excuse for a cash-? Ooh! You mean Squidward.
He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring...  ...complete privacy.
"It's all right here, Mr. Krabs. The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines."
"First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker,  for I am certified."
"Oh, sure."
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence?  Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?"
"Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent."
"Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs..."
"Can do, Mr. Krabs."
"Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help.  Okay, you stand here...  Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun.  And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward.  Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again."
"Darn, one more time."
"Not yet, Mr. Krabs."
This just isn't adding up.
"We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you."
"He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?"
"Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can."
"Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?"
"That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside."
"Ah!  Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.  Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see!  Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?"
"Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too."
"You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got."
What can we get for one dollar?
What else have you got?
Nah.
No.
Eugghh. Don't you have anything good?
"Wow, invisible spray!"
"Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this."
"Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray."
"I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair."
"Well, let's get started."
Any particular reason you took your pants off?
"That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second.  Okay, Patrick, give me the can."
"Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea."
Give me that thing.
"Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!"
"Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?"
"No guts, no glory!"
"Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it."
"Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off."
"Oh sure, it's...half past invisible."
"Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?"
Thank you.
"Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea."
"Okay, we're invisible, right?"
"If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank."
Let's go scare us some suckers.
"Boy, we really scared her!"
"A better question would be, who isn't?"
It's official - we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.
"There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs."
We'll see about that!
"Krabs, we've come to haunt yooOOOOuuUUUuuu!"
"You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut."
"Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets."
"Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs."
Pay!
PaaAAAAyyYYyyy!
I know not these names of which you speak.
"We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em."
"Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes."
"Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened."
"Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport."
"That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy!"
Patrick!
We should have bought the whoopee cushion!
And SpongeBob!
"Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden."
"Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff."
"Thank you, Patrick. You know, my shoes feel kinda tight.  Huh, nice and roomy."
"That's a great idea, Squidward!"
"Oh, yes, I agree completely. Come on, Patrick, let's do some good deeding!"
"Hey, Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped."
"There, now you've got plenty of space."
There he is.
"Now, Patrick!  There you go, Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make big money.  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward."
"I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But time's a wasting! We need another good deed!"
"Um, right, that thing that we did that day."
Are you sure?
"Hmm, how to fix his nose?"
"Patrick, that's brilliant!"
That didn't work.
"Hmm. I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head."
"Right, too small."
And a giant.
"That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!"
"And we run around and scream like crazy!  Try and catch us, giant monster Squidward!"
This is really fun.
"You are very good at pretending, Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along."
"Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all."
Even though you really wanted to.
"Good night, Squidward."
"Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button."
"Oh, Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him."
We shall do him another.  We did it!
"Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one."
We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet.
Another funtastic day at Glove World!
"Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...  Patrick? Do you have any change?"
How much is it?
Fifty cents.
Lemme check my other poc-
What did you say?
"Thanks, mister."
Okay! Here's my glove light.
I see you!
Cool!
"Yeah, Patrick?"
Where did you see that?
What?!
"Patrick, I think we're on the wrong...  ...bus!  But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom."
"Rock Bottom.  It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different."
"Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know.  Maybe we should wait for one more."
"Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes. I'm gonna get a bus schedule.  Boy, this place sure is creepy."
"I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus.  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle.  I better go wait for the next one.  C'mon, bus! I've got to get home and feed Gary!  Uh-oh, shoe's untied.  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over...  and through the barrel.  My balloon!  Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again!  Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me?  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I...  No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes...  Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot no matter what!  I'm gettin' hungry. Glove candy dispenser! Good thing I went to Glove World!.  Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that?  A candy machine.  Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm...  I'm not leaving this spot no matter what!  I'll only be gone a second.  Hey!  Ooh!  Come on, come on!  Hey! That was mine!  Barnacles! Alright, that's it! No more mister nice guy!  Tartar sauce!  Fish paste!  I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom! I am first in line and no one is gonna tell me otherwise!  Okay, second! I am second in line!  Okay, third is good!  Fourth, not bad.  Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it!"
"Well, at least the line is moving.  Tartar sauce!"
Huh?
"Finally! Yes, I'm next!  When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?"
The bus schedule. The next bus.
The next bus...  to Bikini...  Bottom.
"Oh,  no...  you don't!"
"Hold it, I'm not through here!  Do you hear me?  I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom right now! Until then, I am not leaving this spot!  Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light!  Ah, that's better."
"This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey!  If I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark."
"Who's there?!  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking.  Running! Better start running! Running!  Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting!  Sitting, sitting. Bleeding.  Hey, who's there?  Okay, that's enough!  Don't come closer!  I'm warning you!  I'm a sponge!  Oh, it's only you.  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem.  I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon...  has...  enough...  air...  thanks.  Hey, I get it, balloon travel! Thank...  you!"
"Ah, home at last."
"Sorry, nurse lady. I've never had a checkup before. It's so much fun!"
Wow! Imagine if it was this easy to get your boating license!
"Oh, no, Mr. Krabs! Getting a checkup is the best! The nurse poked me  and prodded me  and jabbed me...  and pulled me  and twisted me.  And—"
"Your turn, Mr. K."
You heard her. The...
"Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday.  Everybody wins!"
Yay! We get to spend the weekend together!
He's coming!
Way ahead of ya!  We'll make him an offer he can't resist!
"Come on, before he sees us!"
Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—
A baby's cheek!
Lucky that was a robot baby.
"Tough, huh? Gosh, the toughest thing I can think of is...Mr. Krabs himself!"
"Welcome, sir."
"Step up here, and we'll begin."
"Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?"
Just grabbing some measurements...
"Sir, try to keep still."
"Uh, no, you can put that away, sir. I'm almost done."
Tell your friends about us!
"Oh, he didn't make the cut."
I do have one plan that might work.
"Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography!  Preserve your precious punim for generations to come!  Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!"
How many X-rays of Mr. Krabs do we need?
25...thousand?
"Squidward, is his skeleton supposed to just fall apart like that?"
"Hey, man, you look like you've had a rough day. How'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage? It's free."
Free.
"You got it, best friend."
Boop!
"All right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension."
Great! He's in the freezer right now.
All right! Final test! Shell durability!
"Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Yes, you failed every test today, but Squidward and I will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend!"
Let's kick it up a notch!
"I don't know what we did wrong, Squidward. Mr. Krabs looks worse than before!"
"Oh, Squidward, I'll miss you too!"
"Uh, eaten!"
Let's just make it one.
I don't know. Let me check the rules.  Playing Certified Public Accountant isn't as much fun as I thought.  Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!
What does that even mean?!
"Yeah, that sounds right to me!"
"Hey, Squidward. Wanna play Certified Public Accountant with us?"
"Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon."
"Well, I think Patrick could make up a game."
"Go get'em, Patrick!"
This is gonna be written about in the history book someday.
It's beautiful!
"Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?"
Wow!
Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
"Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?"
Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
"Yeah, play by the rules."
Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
"Come on, Squidward! Wait!"
Squidward!
Squidward made us say his name.
Now you roll after me.
"Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll..."
I'll...
I'll... race the car!
Two.  Silly face! Silly face!
"Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!"
"Good job, Squidward! You've won!"
"Ah!  Hm... Mm-hm. It's scary, but...  Oh. Hello.  Hm..."
"Hello, Sir Patrick. How do you like my decorations?"
"Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year."
Close your eyes.  Okay. Open 'em.  ♪I'm a lovely flower♪ Ooh...
"I don't want to see the scary stuff, Patrick. Okay? I admit it. I love trick-or-treating, but I am too afraid to go out on Halloween!"
Scary equals funny. Hm. Never looked at it that way before.  Doink. All right. I'll go out.
"Here I am.  Just looking for cavities. Nope. None here. Oh, let's go out and get scared."
"Oh, I'll be fine, Patrick. Really. But can we hold hands, just in case you get scared?"
"Oh, hi, Sandy. I didn't recognize you."
"Oy.  Ew. Oh. Ew, it feels like worm guts."
"Oh, I'm savvy to this game, Sandy.  So these brains are probably a slimy head of lettuce, or maybe some boiled broccoli."
"Patrick, you really got me."
That's the most realistic fake monster I ever saw.
"I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny."
Scary.
"Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs, but our new philosophy is scary equals funny."
"Ready for more funny, Sir Clanks-a-lot?"
"Ooh, scary!"
Oh.
"Oh, Plankton, you are a panic."
"Gee, who would've thought I'd be laughing myself silly tonight?"
Um...I guess so?
"Well, I was, until I found out that scary equals funny."
I love this guy!
Sure. Can I bring a guest?
"We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny!"
Oh! Hey!
That tickled!
Oh...
"Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place!"
That almost looks like Sandy.
"That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton.  Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical.  Why aren't you laughing?  Patrick? What's wrong with you?"
"Patrick? Is this really happening? Hey, this isn't funny."
Hm?  Yup. I got the same answer. Scary equals Ahh!
Ahh!
"You let my friends go, buddy boy!"
"Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures."
I wuv you this much!
Sure. We learned not to be afraid to never be scared of being afraid again.
"Patrick, I'm scared!"
We are camping.
"Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?"
Okay. Have fun inside.
Just... have fun inside. See you tomorrow.
What?
What?
But all I...
Okay. Have fun inside.
Squidward's gonna come camping with us!
"That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?"
Customization!
He's tenderizing the ground!
WRITE THAT DOWN!! WRITE THAT DOWN!
"Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat."
SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.
SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.
"But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?"
But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
"Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one The Campfire Song Song. ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪"
"♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...♪"
♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪ Patrick!
"Squidward!  Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪  ♪OH, YEAH!!!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?"
"OH NO! I'll save you, Squidward!!!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?"
But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.
What are you saying?
"Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real! It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer!"
"Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin..."
"Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet."
Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.
Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.
Don't ever eat cheese.
Cubed. Sliced is fine.
Never wear a sombrero...
Or clown shoes.
And never...
Ever...
No.
No!
"Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt."
Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.
No. Like that.
"Squidward, are you okay?"
Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back.
Don't run! Sea bears hate that!
They hate limping more than running!
I should have warned you about crawling.
I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.
"Here, draw a circle."
That was an oval. It has to be a circle!
"Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros."
"Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?"
You wanna stay here? At my house? With me?
Yee-hee! Slumber party!
"We can stay up really, really late! And tell ghost stories! And trade socks!"
No. They invite boys over and destroy the house!
You know how girls are.
Do I know any... no. But Gary does.
"Mr. Krabs, it’s only a mov-"
I don't think this is the scary part yet.
"Gosh, Mr. Krabs. I never knew you were scared of zombies."
Zombie teenagers?
Mr. Krabs...
"Oh, I do, Mr. Krabs. It must be horrible to invite people into your home and have them treat your property with so little respect!"
"Gosh, no, Mr. Krabs."
"Leave it to me, Mr. K. I've got the perfect disguise."
"I don't know, but she is ug-ly! Now to put on that disguise I told you about.  Ta-daaaah! Huh? Huh? Huh?"
Pizza delivery.
Y-You didn't?
Your dad sent it. It's already paid for.
Um.. uh...  Hey!
"They're on to us, Mr. Krabs! Drive!"
"I wanted to come with you, Mr. Krabs."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I failed you."
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, that’s my eye!"
Piano repair man!
"Mr. Krabs, it's working!"
"Maybe we should leave them alone, Mr. Krabs. They seem pretty trustworthy."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs."
"It's me, SpongeBob SquarePants. Can we talk, Pearl? Whale to sponge?"
"Oh, please let me stay at your party! Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!"
Give me one good reason why I can't stay!
"Yeesh, I only asked for one."
Really?!
"So if I prove I'm fun, can I stay?"
I only need eight!
Whoo! Party!  Crank it up!
These old newspapers are confetti in fun hands! Whoo!
"Ooh, Mr. Krabs' root beer cellar. Fun!"
Party!
Fun!
Who wants to dance?
Let's boogie! Whoo!
"Well, Mr. Krabs, you know how boys are.  Ow!"
"Mr. Krabs, I think I know what'll cheer you up.  A mug of ice cold root beer!"
"Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird."
This whole sack?
"Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian."
What's that lump in its belly?
Wait! You forgot about this pet!
"Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella."
"Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998, 999, 1,000. Ready or not, here I come!"
"I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun."
"Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. It's only until tomorrow."
"Here I come, Wormy!"
He's gotta be in here.  I think something bad happened to Wormy.
"I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!"
"Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door!  No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit!"
"Let's not panic. We just have to stick together. Remember, it's two against one. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  It’s eaten Patrick!  Patrick, you're alive!"
"Patrick, we can't leave this horrible monster in Sandy's house. It might eat Sandy's other pets!"
"No, it might eat Sandy! We've gotta get it out of here!"
It's working. It’s gonna answer it.
"You look pretty appetizing, Patrick. Now, just stay here and wait for the monster. I'll go get the net."
"Hold on, Patrick!"
"I'm coming, Patrick!  No, Monster, please don't eat me! No, no, no! Spare me, I don't taste good, no! Please! Wait a second.  Yeah!  We did it, Patrick! Sandy's gonna be so proud of us. We got that horrible monster out of her house and best of all her pets are safe. 'Cause that horrible creature is now......heading straight for the Krusty Krab!  It's going in the front! Let's use the secret entrance."
"Hit the deck, Mr. Krabs!"
We're in serious danger. There's a-a-a...a monster out there.
"Oh no, Mr. Krabs. It doesn't want to eat Krabby Patties. It wants to eat YOU!"
Why? Why? He was so young.
A living nightmare!
We tried to warn them. I can't watch.
Squidward?
"It ate them! And there it goes!  First Wormy, then Squidward, Mr. Krabs!  That flying monster has eaten three friends too many. We must inform the citizens! Evil has surfaced. The faith of Bikini Bottom is in our hands, Patrick. Now let's roll."
"Okay, Patrick, this is a very delicate situation. It must be treated with great care and sensitivity."
"Run, everybody, run!"
Monster!
"We did it, Patrick! We saved the city!  Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster."
Sandy caught the monster!
"Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for 2 whole days."
"Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!"
"She won't be back for 1 more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds!"
"Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here."
"I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her."
"No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome!"
"Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be in about...  ...Whoo! Right now!  ♪ Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya! ♪"
"That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy!  First cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then..."
I knew it! You have been itching to see us!
Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return.
"Dig in, Sandy!  Uh..."
"Are you okay, Sandy?"
"Uh... hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya a little somethin' somethin'."
Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
"Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?"
Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?
What's a flea?
"Ahahaha, he tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  OWWWW!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?"
"Nyahh! Oh. Sandy, please. Hellllp meeeee!"
I need it more.
"Um, is that what over looks like?"
Whoa!
Aah!
"Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go!"
"Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay?"
Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did!
Stop smudging my helmet!
Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
"It sure is good to have you back, Sandy."
"This is how to live, isn't it my friend?"
What's that Pat?
I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo!
"Hey Patrick, where you going?"
I don't know about this Patrick.
De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry.
"Uh, Patrick, where are we going?"
"I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger..."
"Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. Living like Larry doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life."
"No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going."
Mmm-hmm.
I wonder how Patrick's doing with his living like Larry thing.
"Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?"
"Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen."
"I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of living in the moment are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did?"
"By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky?"
"So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry!"
"Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?"
"Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry!"
Prepare for countdown!
3-2-1 Lift off.
Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!!
"What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more.  What would Larry do?"
"(yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!"
I know! What do you think we should name it?
"We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!"
Wouldn't that be the top?
"Squid, wait! Wait!"
Ship!
"No, look, a giant ship!"
"I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it."
"Squid, wait!"
Doesn't this place seem familiar?
I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?
I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.
"No, no, it's not rawr!"
"That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!"
It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.
"Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?"
"No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship."
That was a closer one!
"No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman."
"Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!"
"You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably..."
Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
"Look, it's easy, it simply means that..."
"So, you don't want it to look good?"
"Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare."
"Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches."
"Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again."
You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Like movie passes?
You're setting us free?
Really?! What is it?
But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.
I always hate going in there!
Wait! Listen!
Never!
No!
"Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?"
"Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!"
"Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one."
"Well, that's not right because..."
"That's you, Patrick. Make your wish."
"Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before."
That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
"Come on! You can do it! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Think really hard! Put on your thinking cap!"
"Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!"
"Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick."
And what did you say your name was?
"Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess."
"Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!"
We're home!
"(yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!"
I know! What do you think we should name it?

We're home!
"That's you, Patrick. Make your wish."
"Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before."
That's not going to do it! Think harder!
"Come on, Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard!  Yes, Patrick! You're doing good!"
Squidward! You get to have a wish! A great big wish!
Hi there. I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick.
And what did you say your name was?
"Oh, nice to meet you, Squid Ward. We have plenty of time to know each other, I guess."
"La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you Twelvey.  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name."
"Gotcha!  ...Barnacles, how'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name."
"I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs."
Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch!   Yum!
"Why, this is a hole, good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically..."
It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Sure!
"No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers.  Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey."
"You okay, Mr. K?"
"Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!"
"Aye, aye, sir!"
"But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?"
No! Never!
"Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive."
"Here you go, Mr. Krabs!"
"More jellies, Mr. Krabs!"
"Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!"
It feels like somebody... WANTS TO SELL ME SOMETHING!
"I'm not interested in anything you're selling!  I sure felt like...  I must be working too hard.  I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?"
"Wrong number.  I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill!  Gary, is that you? Gary?  Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen.  Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly.  Blue jelly?!  Hey, old No Name? What's happening?"
"No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business?  Hey, I don't remember that factory!  Huh?  What is this horrible place?"
What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?
Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
"Oh, boy! A tea party!  You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!"
Something that should've been done a LONG TIME AGO!
The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
"And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free!"
Freedom! FREEDOM!!!
"Goodbye, friends!"
"He really got burned on that deal!  All is as it should be.  I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever!  Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... Friend."
"Hey, where's my alarm clock?"
"Your shell is gone, too?"
I think we've been robbed!
"Hmm, strange indeed..."
I hope this doesn't mean that we're missing the one thing that's nearest and dearest to our heart.
The Krusty Krab!  Phew.
"Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?"
Where's your dad?
Mr. Krabs is missing?
...and Gary's shell.
Bikini Bottom Triangle?
The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs! We gotta find him!
"Mr. Krabs, are you out here?"
"No, just a thick eerie fog."
Squidward.
"Come on, Squidward, quit messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra-  Hey, gumballs! ."
"Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs?  Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!"
Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
"Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in any pain...wherever he is."
Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up! We gotta get out of here!
Patrick!
"No.  Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?"
"That's it, Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!"
You're telling me.
"Yes, mermaid ladies, you actually can help us."
"Yeah, we'd like to know how to get out of here, please."
"Uhh, are you sure?"
T-nop?
"Oh, T.N.O.P! Okay, well, thanks anyway. Come on, Patrick, let's go. Patrick?"
"Sir, I'm back. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the information from the-"
"Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten."
"Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there er... there is no way out."
"Oh, sir, I-"
Totally Not Our Problem.
"That's it, sir! It's the mermaids!"
The reverse switch is the mermaids! They just need to sing their song backwards.
"Isn't that great, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is reclaiming their stuff."
Mr. Krabs?
Patrick! You dropped your cummerbund!
"♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...♪  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!"
"Sure thing, Mr. K.  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!"
I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life!
"Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!"
Whoo!
"Yay!  Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go up against that beast!"
Yes! Go!  Patrick?! How could they?! This is horrible!
I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there!  Patrick!
"No time for chitchat, get in!  Hurry up, Nelly!"
"What do we do now, Patrick?"
"NO!  Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh?  That's it, Patrick! He's not chasing us. He's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck!"
"My pleasure, Captain!"
"Sure, Patrick, ya..."
Who did?
"Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin!  But, Patrick, you can't go! Not like this! Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo?!"
"Unset it, please unset it!"
"Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes."
That's my peanut butter.
"I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick.  WITH ALL MY PICKLES!!!!"
"Wait! Stop! What about all our plans?  8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me?"
But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?
"You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long."
"There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you.  Patrick, you okay?"
"Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder."
Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume.  Hmmm...
"That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a..."
"Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman."
"It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be.  You're all set. Come on out, Patrick."
"The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia."
...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia!
"Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a..."
But she's not my girlfriend.
"C'mon, Patricia."
"But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours."
"Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia."
No.
"Quite an appetite, but she's all woman."
"But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!"
"What's the matter, Patrick?"
The assassin!
I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.
"Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price."
"Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list?"
Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!
"Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!"
"Here you go, sir."
I have an idea!
"Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
"Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!"
Mr. KraaAAaaaAAAbbs! I haAave an ideeeaaaaAAaa!
"OK. Mr. Krabs, Prepare yourself. Don't bother sitting down, because you'll just stand up when you see this!  Ta-da!"
"Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat  Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors."
No.
Stop it!  I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant!  You'll see!
"Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too!?"
What's the matter?
"I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so."
I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
"Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick?  Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open.  I'm ready!  I'm ready.  I'm ready...  Patrick! How long have we been standing here?!?"
What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb.
I'm scared.
Did you find anything?
"Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties!"
Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these?
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I don't know.
"At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...  ...shredding it...  ...and burning it!  But in the end, we decided just to give it all away."
"Who's #46,853?"
"Here you are, sir. Stay pretty.  All right.  Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs?  The Pretty Patties are a big hit."
"No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab."
"Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs?  That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?"
You will?
"What did you say, Mr. Krabs?"
"Thank... you... what should I do now, Mr. Krabs?"
"I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs."
Dreams do come true!
"Look at me, I'm...  ...naked!  Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary."
"I'm ready!!!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!"
"There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye , lay it on the line and... I can't do this!  Hey, Patrick-"
I was just...
"I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough."
Mine were.
I did.
I am!
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
"I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self!"
"Permission to come aboard, captain.  I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew  and now I'm ready.  So, uh, when do I start?"
"Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me."
"Aye aye, captain!  One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!"
"♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪"
"♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪"
Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with  port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive!  Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen!  Who's hungry?!
"Hi, Squidward! What'cha watchin'?"
Ooh.
Don't change the channel!
"Did you see that, Squidward?  Snail Bites."
"Gary, I'm home!  Oh, Gary! You've got a big surprise coming to you."
Snail Bites.
It smells good?
Does somebody want another Snail Bite?  Can somebody roll over?  Roll over.
We'll have some more of these a little later.
More treats?
"Well, I can't say no to my wittle Garebear."
"Gary, that's an awful lot of Snail Bites for one evening. Are you sure you want more?  Well, I suppose one more couldn't hurt.  Whoops, looks like that was the last of them Gary. We're all out.  It's probably for the best.  I'm getting pretty tired anyway. I think I'll skip my nightly motivational exercise and go to straight to bed."
"Gary, please!"
"Gary Wilson, Jr., I promise you we will get more treats tomorrow! Now, please, let me  sleep."
Gary! It is 4:00 in the morning! What exactly do you want from me?!
"Gary, this is ridiculous! See? The pet store won't be open for hours.  Not to mention it's freezing out here! Can't we just go home and come back in the morning?"
"I just can't say no to my little Garebear.  Good night, Gary.  See ya in the morning!"
Excuse me!
Do you have any Snail Bites? We need some Snail Bites.
"Yes, sir!"
"Ok, Gary, I'm off to the Krusty Krab!  Hope your day is as fun-filled as mine! Whoa! Gary?!  Yes, so, I will see you tonight, Gary.  Gary, is that a box of Snail Bites in your teeth? He, he. That's funny, because I think I just saw a half-full box in the kitchen."
"Gary, what are you doing here? You're causing a scene!"
"I know, you want more Snail Bites. But the pet store was completely sold out of them!"
"I know, Gary..."
"Gary, I just said the pet store was completely sold out of Snail Bites! What am I supposed to do?"
Thanks a lot.  You're what?!
"You see, Gary? There are no more--"
"So, you see, Gary, there..."
"Would you mind being quiet for one second, please!"
"Gary, they're completely sold out. There are no more Snail Bites left in the entire world and there never will be!"
"What. Do. You. Want. Me. To. Do. Gary?!  Travel the Earth, checking every pet store in existence to see if they happen to have a box of Snail Bites left? Is that what you want?!"
"Gary, take a look at this map.  This is a map of every pet store in the entire world! We've been to every single one of them, Gary! And not one of them has the treats you are after! Not one! I can't keep looking, Gary. I just can't."
But I don't want to say no to my wittle Gare-Bear! I want him to be happy!
"But I don't know how to say no, Patrick!"
I can't! You're so cute!
No!
"Gary, this won't be easy, but the time has come when I must say nee, nn... Oh, Gary, It's a photo, it's a framed photo of the moment I picked you up at the pound!  I remember that day like it was yesterday. Oh, and a photo of the time you built me a castle made of glitter and lollipops.  Gary, this is the most special-- Oh! Nice try, Gary."
"Gare-Bear, we looked everywhere! There are no more Snail Bites. I'm sorry, Gary, but the answer is... no."
"Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming!"
Popcorn is served!
I want to impress and amaze my friends!
"Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill."
"Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!"
"Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1..."
"Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic."
Then take one card and shove it in your ear.
"And finally, say the words Hobris-Pobris.  Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form.  Presto!  Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam!  Abracadabra.  Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward.  I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible.  Whoa-oh!  Squidward! Speak to me! Speak!  Hey, Squid, are you okay?  Hey, Squid, are you still okay?  Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer.  Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy."
I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.
It's all my fault.
Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone.
Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!
Patrick!  Pat...!
"Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!?  This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone."
"No! It's Squidward!  And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged.  Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?!  It's all your fault!  Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!"
"No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic!  Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person."
"It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream."
"Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back."
I need your help to change him back.
"But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever."
I'll wait.
"Oh, please."
"But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery."
"I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?"
Are you Mister Magic?
Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
"I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways!  You have ruined my faith in the magical arts."
What are we going to do about Squidward?
"Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!..."
"Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked.  I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now?"
"Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica."
Ooh!  A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!
"Whoa, whoa-whoa.  Wow!"
"Oh, yeah!"
"One, please?"
"Mmm!  Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs!  Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!"
"Gee, it's good to see ya!"
"Uh, oops. Sorry."
"So, how you been? How are things?"
Let me see if I can fix that for you.
Ta-da!
I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...
Count me in!
"Okay, mm, uh-huh."
"Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!"
"Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown!"
"Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—"
"Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Whoa!  My eyes!"
I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
Watch out!
No! Stay away!  I'm a monster!  A monster!  Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
"Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me."
"Okay.  The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second.  Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um... I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry!"
"Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—"
Mr. Krabs!
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet."
You popped it all.  There's nothing left!
"No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved."
"Oh, yeah!"
Let's blow this popsicle stand.
Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab.
Huh.
I was just testing it.
One Krabby Patty coming up!
"What's wrong, Mr. Krabs?"
You've gotta let go of the dime.
"Oh no, not again!"
Ahh! Really?
"The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?"
Ah... This is the best day of my life.
"But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?"
Squidward!
You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register.
"I can't believe this is really happening.  Today, I start living!"
"Hey, Patrick!"
No problem!  Here ya go!
"Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?"
"Do you want four quarters?  Or ten dimes?  Or twenty nickels?  Or one hundred pennies?  Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies?  Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are..."
Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored.
"May I help you, sir?"
"Oh, hi, Squidward!  How are those errands going?"
"Well, I'm sure you are."
I'm sure you are.  How's that?
"Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles.  Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge."
I will destroy the Krusty Krab!
Have you finished...?
Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?
But I haven't...
"Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear  these hats."
"Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet?"
"Uh, does that mean you're...?"
"Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the Closed sign to Open. . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off!"
"One cryin' Johnny comin' up!  First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up!"
"Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up!"
"I got it already, Squidward.  Bubble Bass!"
Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
"Well then... here ya go!  Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?"
No!
"But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on!  Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles?"
"Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty."
Wait! Wait! Wait!
"Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right!  Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No!  Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go?  Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it!  Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no!  Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything."
"Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?"
"Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup...  The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!  Oh.  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain.  Uhh, which way do I live?  Of course.  No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe?  I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight."
"Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or...  D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow.  Good night, Gary."
"Aw, this isn't right.  Good night, Gary."
"Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!"
Gary!
"Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?"
I anything can't do right since because pickles.
"I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs."
I how do that?
"Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I..."
"No, no, no, no, no.  I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!"
"Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!"
"Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works!  I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order!"
"I'm right here, Bubble Bass."
This is where I belong!  .
Rawr.
I didn't.
Wait a minute!  Look!  He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward!  Hip hip...
Hip hip...
Hip hip...
Hip hip...
"Oh, boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!"
You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Mermaid Man is timeless!
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this... this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me?  Traitors! Wait ‘til we tell Mermaid Man about this.
Too old for an action movie...huh.
Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
But they are! And they're using...  actors.
They have shunned our heroes.
"Well, that makes it even worse."
"Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals."
"Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and...  their actors."
"Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?"
"No, Patrick, to start making a movie."
Let's start with...the title.
"Great, Pat, what happens?"
City...
Underground...
Adventure...
"End.  That's great, Pat.  Hmm, seems kinda short."
"Longer, yes. Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face...  ...shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer."
"Good one, Pat."
We're making a movie.
"Sure, Mr. Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie."
"You can be in it, too, Pearl."
Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives.
Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair.
Patrick will run the camera.
This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
"Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'."
Makeup artist.
"Okay, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?"
"They're beautiful! They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Okay, action!"
"Good job, Sandy!"
What are you doing?
"That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator!"
"Okay, Patrick, start the movie!"
"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's stolen Krabby Patties."
"Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's stolen Krabby Patties!"
"Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job."
"Okay, action!"
Cue the sound effects.
Almost there!
"Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage."
"Patrick, what is that?"
"No, Patrick, this."
Did you just put that on?!
The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!
"Patrick, this is good. Roll the film."
"Mr. Krabs, why are you weeping?"
And here comes the filling!  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
"Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties.  What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure?  It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!"
Watch me!
"I'd better call the doctor, 'cuz I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?"
"Did you say, Hello! to the flowers yet?"
"Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you."
"Hi, Patrick!  How does this keep happening??  Hi.  She's beautiful!  What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish?  Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic... perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty... or Debbie.  She must have spotted my floral bookmark!  She's coming this way. That's it, girl... don't be afraid... I'm just a talking sponge, is all...  Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever?  I'll take that as a yes!"
"Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work I see."
"Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift."
"That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery."
"Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!"
I knew I should've named her Debbie.
"You're welcome, Mr. Krabs."
"Good one, sir.  Hah! It worked, girl.  We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build.  Only eight more hours."
"No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job.  Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch?  Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or..."
"No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery... wheesnoff."
"That was close.  From now on, no more hijinks. Order up!"
Did you look under the tray?
"They vanished! Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next?! I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!"
Oh?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back."
"Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control!  Now then, you were saying?"
"You got it, Squidward?  Ghosts.  Mystery, you ate my hat.  Mystery, you ate my spatula. You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!!!"
Mystery got a bellyache from eating Krabby Patties. So I made her a bicarbonate of soda.
"No, Mr. Krabs. Please don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend."
You do?
"What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?"
"Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand."
"Okay, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for!? Can't you see I don't want you anymore!  JUST GET OUT OF HERE, YOU STUPID DUMB ANIMAL!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again."
Mystery!
Mystery! Wheesnoff!
I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.
It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.
"Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gary?"
"Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!"
"That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Ooh!  Uh oh.  All right!"
Hi Patrick!
"Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy."
Is there a problem?
"While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?"
"Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!"
"But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?"
"I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?"
Huh?
"Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius."
"Cover me till I get back, okay?"
"Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning."
"Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?"
"Well, I need you to do it again."
"Patrick, what are you talking about?"
"Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!"
"Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?"
"Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!"
You were supposed to say hi to me!
"Oh. All right, let's take it from the top."
Don't forget your line this time!
"Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!"
Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Ugh!
"Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection."
"Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins..."
"Hi, Mr. J."
"...placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk...  and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!  Whoa!"
"Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now."
"Eh, what is that stench?"
"Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it."
"Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine."
You look over there and I'll look over here.
Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick!
Patrick!  Thank you.
Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!
I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.
"Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time."
"Not now, Patrick."
Where?! Where?!
"Patrick, I don't have time for this!"
Where?!
"Patrick, are you with me or against me?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!"
"My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick."
I think you'll find everything shipshape.
"Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story."
"Thanks, uh...  Betty."
"Hi, Squidward."
Whatcha doing?
"Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out."
"But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a...  Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?"
"Aww, come on, Squidward.  I can get you there lickety-split."
"Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in."
"Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home."
"Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help."
Fluff your pillow?
Fluff your IV bag?
"Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful."
"Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve."
"Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—"
"Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo!  Ooh! Candy stripes.  Strawberry."
"Wait a second! I think I've seen this before.  Mm, yeah.  Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken."
"You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time.  Mm-hmm.  Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys."
"No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help."
Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time.  Ah!
"Ready, set."
"Hi, Mrs. Puff."
"Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine."
Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes.
"Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day.  Let's get medical."
"Oh, no."
Me? Perform a surgery?
"Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too."
"Oh, hi, everybody."
"Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew.  Here we go!"
"Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and—  no! Shoot!  Son of a gun!  Ah, my bad."
"Ah-ha!  Mmm, sushi."
"He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job."
"Oh,  Thank you! Let's try again, shall we?"
Order up!
Yow! That shouldn't be in there.  Ooh!
Ta-da!
"Nurse, sponge."
"Thank you, nurse."
Ta-da!
"There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse."
"I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look."
"Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!"
How's about the Squidward Classic?
"Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it."
D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work.
"No, I'm just a fry cook.  But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye!"
Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
"Yeah, I know!"
"Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is  the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink.  Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay.  Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go!  Gee, this is harder than I thought..."
"It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license!  Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6 o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go.  I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics?"
"I can feel those juices pumpin' now!  Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper!  Come on, pencil, make words."
"Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How’s my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?"
What do you mean you're not hungry?
"I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary.  I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite.  Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits?  Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen.  Hmmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage.  Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... 10 o'clock?! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!  I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and...  done. Now lets see how it looks so far. The-  Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go... thinks SpongeBob think!"
"Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?"
"That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the..."
That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Uh... Marco!
"Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write?  Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy?  I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper!  Now they're floating around my thinking space.  So long, pesky particles!  I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water!  That was a close one."
"What do you mean 'overly dramatic', Gary?  All that choking sure made me hungry."
"I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese  A visitor? For me!?  Hello!"
"Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?"
Rye or pumpernickel?
"So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain..."
How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay?
Hi-yah!
"Oh no! Midnight!  Must... get... back to desk!  Whew, that was a close call.  Ah! My pants!"
You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
"Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants..."
No!  What have I done?!  Help! Help! My house is on fire!
"Where's my essay! Oh, there you are!  I must have dozed off.  Lets see where are we?  Do I dare look at the clock...  It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight!  And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep...  Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is!  Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?"
"Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em."
But what about my essay?
"Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!"
"I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech."
"Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff."
"And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears.  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re..."
"I overdid the speech again, didn't I?"
"Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya."
"Yes, Mrs. Puff?"
"A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!"
"Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?"
"On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window."
The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick! Down here!
Patrick. Come down here.
I'm down here.
That's hall monitor to you!
"Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in."
"Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?. Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?"
"Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?"
"Okay, now what?"
"This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out!"
"SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report."
"Get a hold of yourself, deputy."
"Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back."
Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
"Where is he, Patrick?"
"That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?"
"Say again, deputy?"
"Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac!"
"Yes, Mrs. Puff?"
"Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home."
"Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place."
What is it?
Texas? What's a Texas?
All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy? Hi-yah!
"Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah!"
"Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up, Sandy!"
"Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!"
"Look, Sandy, we caught one!"
We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
"Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home!"
"Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?"
Sandy...
"Homesick, huh?  Almost there."
Da-ta-dah.
Sandy?
"I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?"
"Patrick, do you hear that?"
"Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy."
"Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas."
"Patrick, you can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!"
Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Shh! Don't spoil the surprise!
You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
What are you doing with those bags?
What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
"Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?"
"But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?"
"No, no! Wait! Sandy!  I can't believe she's gone."
You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
"Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about...  Texas!"
"Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!"
Howdy y'all!
"The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas!  Hey, Patrick, what am I now?"
"No, I'm Texas!"
You'll have to catch us first!  We did it! We got her!
"Okay, Patrick, that's enough."
"Run faster, Patrick!"
No! Almost there!
"Sandy, no!"
It's a party!
"It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing...  ...giant Barbecues..."
"...homemade peas-in-a-can pie...  ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats!  So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?"
"Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags."
Does that mean you'll stay?
That makes me feel all wiggly.
You dance divinely.
"Oh, I love this song!"
We wanna have fun.
"Come on, Squidward. Give us something fun to do. Please?"
No problem. I'll whip up some grub.
"Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here."
"A party game in which participants work in teams to collect a list of miscellaneous objects! Scavenger hunt, yeah! What's first on the list, Squidward?"
Sandwich?
Sandwich? Sandwich?
"Goodlands, half a league."
"Badlands, 20,000 leagues?"
It's no use. We'll never find the rare Desert Sandwich.
Squidward! We did it! We brought back the first item!
"What's next on our scavenger hunt, Squidward?"
"Don't worry, Patrick. A scavenger is always prepared.  The rope is too short! We need another one!"
"Thanks, Patrick! Where'd you get another rope?"
Found it!
We're back!
"Squidward is against the ropes. A left, a right."
"Oh, and the champ is down!"
You have to keep your skull... numb.
"Ooh, the Loch Ness Monster!"
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
We don't have to find it. It'll find us.
"Oh, simple.  Bagpipes."
But it sure loves to eat 'em!
"Come on, just one more."
Aww.
What was his name?
"Um? Aw, what a pretty name."
That's so sad!
"Come on, Patrick, we've got some extreme scavenging to do!"
Squidward's brother!
Squidward's brother!  Squidward's brother?
He's right here! Squidward's brother!
Um! Squidward's brother!
"Mrs. Tentacles?  Mrs. Tentacles, you're Squidward's mother. You must know where Squidward's brother is."
"Aw, that's so sad. Squidward wanted a baby brother so badly he imagined one."
"Hm?  Oh, I'm getting a brainstorm!"
"No, Patrick, let it flow.  Ooh, I have a plan."
Squidward. We found your brother.
You do now!
"Come on in, Mama."
"Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is.  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble."
"Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!"
"Hey, you like karate too.  So, uhh, what's your name?"
I'm SpongeBob!
Oh.  Oh yeah? Watch this
"Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah!  Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?"
May I try it on?
Me too. I love air. Air is good.
"Why, air is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air."
"Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?"
I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
I guess so.
How's that?
Like that?
"Thanks, pal."
"Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob."
"Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here."
No water?
Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water.
I brought you some flowers.
"Yes, I'm okay."
I can’t imagine why.
Water would be nice.
Take your time.  I gotta get out of here!
"I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it..."
"I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I need it!"
I'm a quitter!
"Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good."
I tried to tell you!
You're... doing it... wrong...
"Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I'm...   Not ready for work!"
"Thanks for waiting, Squidward."
"I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants."
"I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?"
"I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!   Squidward, what are you doing?!"
I don't follow.
"Speak English, brainiac!"
"Mmm, strawberry!"
"Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work!  Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!"
There is always a shortcut!
"Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!"
You're not going to come with me?
"Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there!  That's the face! That's the look!    First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut!  Huh?"
"Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged!  First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut!  There, that's better.   Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost!"
"Local landmarks...  A-ha!  Right at this large and unusual shell.  Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant.  There it is, the Krusty Krab!"
The Krabby Krust?!  Is that the name of a restaurant?
Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
"Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom!  Here, take these coupons!"
"I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now?"
"Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money!  Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came...  I'm lost!  Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant!  Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant!  So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out.  Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone.  Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it.  My last dime.  I hope this works."
"It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone."
Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?!
"I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?"
"Uh, hold on!  Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!"
Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
"What ya doing there, drinking soda?"
Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
"Ooh, you drive a pedicab?"
"Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it!"
"Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school!  Krusty Klam?!  Wait, Scott, come back!  Tartar sauce!"
"No! Over the cliff!  Through the toxic runoff!  Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe!  Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire!  Up this massive hill!  That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early!  I made it! I made it!  Oh, random Krusty Krab patrons! How I've missed out!  Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces!  I missed the bathroom, too!   But most of all, I missed you, choking guy!   Patrick? How did you get here?"
"Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?!"
Mr. Krabs!
"Aye-aye, sir!"
I am raking the leaves.
"Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves."
"What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?"
Hibernating? What's that?
Can I do that?
"Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male."
"Why, Sandy? When does your... carburation begin?"
"But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!"
Climb!
Jump!
Ride!
"Wait, Sandy!"
Sandy?
"Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you."
Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!
"Yeahhh...  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow."
"Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night, Gary."
W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?
"Yeah, I've never played extreme jacks before!"
"Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?"
"Gee, that sounds safe!...I mean, fun.  Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy?"
"the industrial park!  This is where the real action is!  This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke!  We're going fly-fishin'!"
"This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something."
"Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to..."
"Ow-ow, ow-ow-ow!  ...OUCH."
Not yet.
You do that.
Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide!  Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret.  Under a rock? It's so original!
"Ahahaha, you said it! Sandy'll never find us!  Hey, wait, you don't understand!"
"AAAAAHHH! C'MON, LET ME BACK IN! You don't understand!"
"Sandy, wait!"
"Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important!  I...am a man!  Okay, Sandy, I...I...I-I-I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE! I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GAMES!! THEY'RE TEARING ME APART!!!  There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I..."
"Sandy?  I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation!"
"What's happening, Patrick, you going on a hike?"
A forever hike?
Who's Nick Fishkins?
"Aw, don't worry, Patrick, you can move in with me. We'll be roommates!"
"Well, we might as well spend the night here. It's not so bad. We could make a home out of all this trash!"
"Morning, Squidward!"
Built a house.
So now we live here.
"Yeah, he said it right on the TV, I wanna buy your home! But we haven't seen any money!"
"Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!"
A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!
How much?
"Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive."
I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!
Why?
How many's a lot?
But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--
"Hey, I could learn German!"
Ach! Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! (Oh! Good morning! My name is SpongeBob!)
Guten morgen! Mein name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen um mein alte heimat besuchen. (Good morning! My name is SpongeBob! I have come to visit my old home.)
"Huh? Oh, ja, I mean, sure, good morning! My name is SpongeBob, what is your name?"
"Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home."
Wife? Where is she?
"Um, would you mind if I stay for zupper?  Whatchya having?"
"Kerglooginpfiefer, that's my favorite! Uh, what's your wife's name?"
"Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?"
Hello!  You must be Hedvig!
I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it.
Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?
I love outdoor concerts.
Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!
I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key.
Yeah!
Squidward?! What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?
"Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?"
Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!
"Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One... two... three!"
Sure is!
We flipped your house for ya.
"♪Oh, I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah! A teaspoon of *raspberry*♪  ♪Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song.♪"
♪Mix in some…♪
♪Nyah-Nyah-Nyah♪
♪Add a splash of wee…♪
"♪And when I'm done, I chop up some… Love.♪"
"Thanks, Plankton.  Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics."
I know what you're doing!
You want me to… join your band!
"Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!"
"Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together!"
"Patrick, Patrick!"
"Patrick, I've got big news!"
What's your news?
"Ew, really?"
Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band!  Can Patrick join our band?
"Hear that, Patrick? You're in."
"Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous!"
"Oh, Squidward…"
Would you help us by joining our band?
"Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us!"
"You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this?"
"Well, with just a little more…"
"You know, pizzazz!"
"Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!"
"Man, how'd you grow that so fast?"
"Whoo, yeah!  Dig that fancy follicle work!"
"Oh, man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this."
"Hi, Squidward. Aren't you coming to band practice?"
"Okay, then, we'll keep your seat warm.  Patrick?"
"Hey, Plankton, what's that?"
Ah…  Plankton and the… Patty Stealers?
I… LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious.
"Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this?  And then turn into one of those songs that goes…"
Or… One about my new friend Plankton?
Or the ventures of wholesome…
"Is that what you mean, Plankton?"
What is that?
"Oh, my gosh! What do I do?"
"♪Time to feed him. Time to feed him. Now it's Gary's feeding time. Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow.♪"
"♪Brush, brush, brush my teeth. Gently keep them clean.♪"
"Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab."
"Uh-huh, but old man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there."
Why?
"Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you."
We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band.
"Got a, uh, what?"
Yes?
"Sure thing, officer.  They're gone."
"Don't worry, I just need to get the key out."
"Whoo, let's rock!"
"All right! Squidward, are you ready?"
"Okay! Patrick, are you ready?  Plankton, are you ready?  Plankton?  PLANKTON!"
Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?
"There's no time to waste, Plankton.  We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two…"
Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!
Ocean wave!!  Tropical breeze.
Reverse Whirlpool!
Oh!  Oh.
"Oh, Squidward! You've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it!"
"I'll get a better look.  Mmmmm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures.  Got it. Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing!"
What's a  reeEEEEeeed!?
There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy.
Oooooooh!
"Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut-hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!"
Hello citizen!
Guarding Sandy's submarine.
Can't. I'm guarding it.
"You're riiiight!  Patrick, you're a genius!"
SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty!
"I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk!"
"Where are we, Patrick??"
It's Sandy!
"Sandy, where are you? Where are we!?"
Um... we broke it.
No problemo! Nice and... EASYYYYYY!!!!!
Give me that!
"Eww, where are we?   MAYDAY! MAYDAY! WE'RE SINKING, AND PATRICK WON'T STOP SCREAMING!"
The reserve tanks are almost empty.  PATRICK!
Natural gas?
Wow...
Yay!
I never thought it would end this way...  It's working!
SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.
I'm already on it.
This stupid hammer won't break anything.
"You're right, Patrick! Whirlpool Spin!!"
Noooooo!!!
"Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Did you want me to... Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs!"
"Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned..."
"I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him!  Hold on, Mr. Krabs! I'm coming for ya!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!"
"Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?"
"Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Mr. Krabs is missing!"
I know!
Don't worry! I'll find him!
Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
"Oh, that's nice."
What? Where are you?
"I gotta save Mr. Krabs!  Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank!"
"Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?"
"Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall."
A bunch of old shoelaces?
I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do.
This vent will surely lead us straight to Mr. Krabs!
"Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen."
"Patrick, you ready?"
"Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse."
"Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mr. Krabs!"
That you can't put a price on freedom?
Hey!
"Hold on, Squidward!  You should be more careful."
"Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations."
"Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward?"
"I know!  Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together."
"Oh, we'll help you pack."
Oh! I have an idea.
"Good morning, Squidward."
"We're not in your bedroom, silly."
Patrick and I mo-
We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming.
"Come on, let's get breakfast."
"Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break."
"Oh! Hi, Squidward."
We're here!
"Well, we got a long drive ahead of us.  We better go before go if you know what I mean-o."
"Now, Squidward, don't leave without us."
"Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick."
"I'll get another roll from the RV.  Hey, where is the RV?"
"Squidward, they weren't eating us."
Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies.
"Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead!"
Bye. Call me. You got my number.  Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip?
"Are you sure about that, Squidward?  Ohh, poor thing just needs some love."
"Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts!  We're so happy for you, Squidward!"
"7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, whoa! Open for business!"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it?"
"Freshness, check. Buns, check.  Fresh patties.  Check.  Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail.  Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here?  Or is it just you?  Ah!  Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward. Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up!  Whoa!  Hmm.  Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good.  Whoa!  I guess this is it.  Oh, you really saved me!  Whoa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go.  Oh, that kinda' hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful!   Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache!  Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties."
"Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous!  Perfection!"
"Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!"
Yes?
Yes.
What's what?
Know what?
What?
What thing where?
"This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there  so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip  and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead, but then I wasn't, but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?"
"Good one, Squiddy."
Yeah.
"I know, it hurts so bad."
Finds out what?
You mean my splinter?
H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!
"Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine!"
While it lasted? What are you doing?  W... What are you...?
"But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine!  I'm fine! I'm okay! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See?  See? See?"
"No, anything but that.  Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen!  You can't let them force me away!"
"Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs!"
Wew.
He does?
"You're right, Squidward. I need help!  Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up.  Patrick?"
Thank goodness you're there. I got a splinter on my thumb and...
"Thanks, Patrick."
"Uh, Patrick..."
Patrick?
"Patrick, this isn't helping!"
I'm not!
"Patrick, you didn't go to med school."
"Patrick, I'm sorry. I really need your help."
"Please, Patrick! I don't want to go home early!"
"Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver.  Ow!"
Ah.
What's what?
You mean this?
"Heh, company pride, of course."
Yes?
Yes.
What's worker's compensation?
Okay.
Squidward!
"Good evening, Squidward."
"Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?"
"Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?"
"Squidward, how come he's so emotional?"
Squidward?
Squidward?
Squidward?
"What is that thing, Patrick?"
"Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him."
"Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl."
"You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly, meet Gary.  Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary!"
"Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here."
"That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's."
"Hmmm, what's all the commotion?"
"Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal."
Smelly.
This isn't good.
"No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?"
"No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison."
"All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me."
"Shh, we'll get caught."
"Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free!"
"Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick."
"Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us."
"Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads."
"Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much."
"You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way."
"Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong."
"Oh. Are you hungry, little clown?"
Why not?
"Oh, Patrick, that little clown wouldn't do that. He was friendly."
"I wanna go backstage and see the clowns, Patrick."
I'll protect you.
Ooh.
Poor little guy.
"Hey, he didn't get any food. Hmm.  Hey, psst!"
"I don't care what that mean old ringmaster says. That clown is hungry, and I'm gonna feed him.  Hey, where'd the circus go? Now I'll never find that little clown."
There you are.
"Hey, little clown. The circus left without you! Quick, we gotta get you back to your clown friends.  Oh, you don't want to go back to the circus?"
You don't want to be a circus clown?
"You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?"
"Oh, you want to work there?  This job should be a snap, little clown. Watch me.  ♪Pick up the hot dog, put it in a bun, add the mustard, relish, now you're having fun♪"
"Okay, you're on."
"Oh, is this your cart? Sorry."
"I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you."
"Businessmen wanted.  Go get 'em, little clown. Oh, I mean, Mr. Little Clown."
Aww.
"What happened, little clown? Didn't you like that job?"
Hmm.  Ooh!
Maybe a career in firefighting.
Have a nice fire!  I'll just make sure he gets there safely.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not Mrs. Puff's Boating School!"
"This is it, little clown. The last job available in Bikini Bottom."
"If you can just stop the clowning for two minutes, you'll have a job. Please! Sorry, little clown. It's been a long day.  Good luck."
"Huh?  Hmm.  Hmm. Aha!  Now get in there, eyes, and stay close to that clown."
"No! No, little clown! No!"
No!  Phew!
Hot pepper pie?!
Lemon pie?!
Honey pie?!
Eye pie!
Fired?
"Oh, little clown, I'm so sorry. I thought you needed a day job, but you're a clown. And a clown needs to run free."
Aww.
Aww.
"Yes, sir?"
I'm on it.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?
Ooh. Slide show.
"Hey, that's my legs."
"Not so good, Mr. Krabs."
Like that door?
Hi! I don't want a free sampl-
"Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh"
"Well, Mr. K., we're back in business!"
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"What's this, Mr. Krabs?"
I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?
Wow.
Detective work. I'm going undercover.
Angela likes Brad.
I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic.
Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.
"That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance."
"Oh, no, I bought the wrong present."
Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.
Isn't he dreamy?
"I'm back, Mr. Krabs!"
The delivery truck will be here momentarily.
That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go!
"Just watch.  Hit it, boys!"
Here's the receipt.
"You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs."
"Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?"
The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey.
"Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing."
"I know, I know. It's so embarrassing.  I wanted the one with the kittens on it."
"Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do."
This one... smells funny.
"Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!"
"Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?"
"One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please."
All right!
"Here you are, my good sir."
So... shiny... and smooth!  Ah... oh! Oh!  Oooh! Mermaid Man's bubble-powered wheelchair from season twelve! And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever.
How much is it? For this one?
"Oh, I have a good feeling about this one. Oh, come on. And it's... not there.  Mmm... no.  Ohhh! (close up on SpongeBob's face) I'll never find card fifty-four!"
"No, it's just another..."
Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!
"Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it!"
Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And  Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?
"I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack.  Whew! Now watch where you're going!"
"Patrick, look out!  Ha, that was close."
"Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been..."
"The card!   Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?"
Ahhh!  Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card.
"The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up!  Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!"
You mean...  you'd give me your most valuable possession?
You're the best pal ever.
"Sure, pal. Anything for you."
"Um, sure, Patrick."
"Patrick, wait! Let me call a locksmith."
"Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't..."
"No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!"
Patrick! The card! It's on fire!
Ew.
Oh! It's ruined!
"Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!"
"No. No! I spent all my money! And,  and,  and, you bought that last pack! So there's no more left in all of Bikini Bottom."
"Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!"
May I... have one?
Wow!
"Wow! Another Mermaid Man reboot. It's how I always re-imagined the reboot would be remade,"
"Oh, cold knees!"
"Longpants?  Well, I don't think I'm ready for looong pants."
Uh..well..I don't...uhhh...Okay!  How do I look?
"You're pulling my leg, sir, I don't look like a man! Do I?"
He called me a man! And my knees are a perfect 72 degrees!
"Yah, it must be the long pants!"
Ohh! I could get used to this job! Hey Squidward what's on sale this week?
"Squidward, how much is the senior discount?"
Squidward?
What do I do when the register is $2000 dollars short?
"Okay!  How is that patty treating you, sir?"
"No, merely a man, a man in longpants.  Oh, my precious longpants!"
"Nothing like that, Mr. Krabs. I just don't think I'm maitre'd material."
"As much as I hate to admit it, I've outgrown the Krusty Krab. Time for me to move on!"
"Allow me, ladies, I should pay, after all, I am a man, and I'm wearing..."
"AH! Shrimp! Oh, dry cleaning, and one hour!"
Has it all ready been one hour? One more time!  Huh?
"You know, I've never took the drivers test with long pants! I'll do it!"
There goes a real man!
"Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this!"
I finally got my drivers license!
"Help wanted? Now this seems like a longpants establishment!   Today's special is a most amusing indian ocean seagrass, handpicked by indigenous prawns, pre-chewed by local manatees, and smothered in a rich, red algae."
"Breeches?  Oh, oh, these old things?"
SpongeBob!
"'Oh,  SpongeRobert."
"Boy, would I! I love parties!"
I'm looking for the party!
"Well, were's all the party hats, where's the cake, and the clown? You can't have a party without a clown!"
"Wait, what's that?  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie is opening tonight! Wow! I totally forgot!  Hey guys, I got an idea! Let's all go to the Mermaid Man movie!"
I don't get it. We have been staring at this table for three hours. That table could use a cleaning.
"Oh! Hey Squidward! Hey, do you understand what this movie is about?"
Hey Squidward?
Are you remembering to flip the patties clockwise? It's very important because the heat..
"Oh, wait, Squidward, I'll walk you out.  Squidward!"
"My pants say yes, yes, yes, but my heart says no! I want to see the Mermaid Man movie!"
"Not only am I one of those nitwits, I actually work there!"
Really!
"What? Rated for those in knee-highs only? Doh! I hate these pants!   Get off!  Oh!, now I know I'm an adult because I've been ripped off by these defective pants!"
"Mr. Krabs, why aren't you watching the movie?"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm not ready for long pants, I want my short pants back, but I can't because these are stuck on me."
"It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember?"
Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.
"Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over."
Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?
"Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over."
Please reply.
"Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!"
"I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud...  ... noises."
"Is he still after us, Patrick?"
Should we turn around and check?
"Oh, I think I landed on my pain center."
"Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there."
"No, not that, Patrick. This!"
I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.
"Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?"
"Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO!  Go on, you first.  Kinda dark, huh?"
"Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir.  Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!"
Gimme that wheel!
"Can we park here?  Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey."
"Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Bye, Squidward."
I like Squidward.
Hello!
Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?
"I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back.  Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir."
Wait! We'll pay ya!
"Thank you, sir, come again!"
"Hey, Patrick."
"Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty?  Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?"
"Folks, have I got a deal for you."
"Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?"
"Here, let me see.  No, Patrick, that says Abyss."
"An abyss is a bottomless...  ...chasm!  Pat, we're falling!"
"Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss!"
"Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?"
Then try one of our Krabby Patties.
No!
What is it?
"No, it's a solid! It's a solid!"
But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.
Anything else before we shove off?
We- We don't have desserts.
"We're back, Mr. Krabs!"
"You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!"
"There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy."
"But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!"
"And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home..."
Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line.
"Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain?"
"In the name of amusement, no...!"
I don't want to ride the Fist Of Pain!
"No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night."
"What was your dream about, Patrick?"
"Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come."
"Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds..."
"Yeah, really fun."
That sure looks like fun.
No tickets. I must have left it at home.
I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
"Oh, barnacles!.  It sure was lucky we found our tickets."
There it is. The line looks awfully long.
"Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler."
Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
"I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick."
"Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile."
"I mean, The Mitten."
Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is.
"Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride?"
We've gone eight times.
Bye.
"Hello, Larry."
"Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry."
"Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry!"
"No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows."
Hurry back so we can go on the ride.
"Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do."
"I know, but the ride is really scary."
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!"
"I have to tell you something too, Patrick."
"Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas..."
Is that all?
"Well, this is it, Pat."
Here we go.
On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
We made it.
"This is it, Patrick."
We made it!
We're not crybabies.
"Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride."
"I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you."
But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
"Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Goodbye, Patrick."
We conquered our fears!
We survived the Fist o' Pain!
Let's go again!
"Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on."
"What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out!  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?"
"Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?"
"Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! OH MY GOSH!  Huh?"
I SURRENDER!!! Oh...
"Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?"
"#17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?"
"There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?"
"Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!"
That sounds like Mr. Krabs.
"That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels recharged.  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah."
"Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!"
"I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too."
"Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
"Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?"
"Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!"
"Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?
Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
"That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love."
"Hey, Mr. Krabs!"
I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!
Squidward?
Mr. Krabs!
Mr...!
"Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries."
"Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!"
Squidward! The robots are running the Navy!
"I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!"
Sorry.
"Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot."
"Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information."
I can't take it!
"Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!"
"Oh, yeah."
Right.
"Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?"
Where's Mr. Krabs?
This is one stubborn robot.
"I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will."
"Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his little buddy."
I guess it didn't know anything.
"This is the last robot, Squidward."
I also said they couldn't love.
"Uh, at least he's not laughing."
"The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary."
"Hey, Squidward.  Pretty incredible shift, huh?"
Any plans after work?
"Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood.   Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there.  So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? . Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward?  Squidward? ."
"Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! It's been so long. I can't even remember your last visit."
"Please? Please? Please?!  Please?! Please?!  Please?  Please?  Please? Please? Please?  Please, please? Pleeeaase? Pleaaaaaase? Please? Please?"
"Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time."
"Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any..."
What if I got a couple of throw pillows?
. Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home?
He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my dirty little hovel.
That's it!
"Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement."
"Oh-okay, Squidward."
"Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ... Oh, P.S."
SquarePants residence.
Squidward!  It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor!
"I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it."
"You won't even recognize the place, Squidward!"
"Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit!"
Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can...
"Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of your home.  So I brought the comfort here!  Isn't it great?!"
Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea?
Hot hors d'oeuvres?
Nachos?
Blancmange?
"Yes, of course.  Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum.  Please make yourself at home!  Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?"
"Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything."
You yelled?
Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit.
Did someone say rash cream?
"Squidward, the rash cream.  Oops.  Oh, no!  I don't think I have a cream for that."
"So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?'"
"Tsk.  Hurry back, Squidward!"
"Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed."
Squidward? You okay? Squidward?  Squidward!
"It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary?"
"I'm trying Squidward, but clocking out is the most upsetting part of the day. At least soon I'll be home, where I can relive all the wonderful moments from my day at work.  I'm all over it boss man.  Order up Gare-ward!"
"It's so hard to leave, even for one night."
Don't you think that working at the Chum Bucket AND The Krusty Krab is a conflict of interest Squidward?
"Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty."
"Hey, this is great!"
A what?
"Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all."
Yah!
"It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony."
"Great job, Patrick!"
"Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great!"
"Well, you guys are stupendous customers."
Flipping.
"I sure have, Mr. Krabs. Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss."
"Yes, sir!"
...
"No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you."
I've got two thumbs-up!
Whoo!
"Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up."
"Well, girl, you really make it work."
Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions.
"You got the right stuff, golden boys."
Are you kidding?
"The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!"
"Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up."
"Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale."
What could do wrong?
"Ah.  Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today."
"Hey, guy. Way to wait."
"Hey, guy. Way to walk."
"Oh, this feels great."
Way to flick that eye booger--
My thumbs. My thumbs! My thumbs!
"How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?"
An action like a thumbs-up?
"But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?"
"Aye aye, Mr. Krabs."
No! I can do it.
"That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I understand."
"Patrick, I'm glad it's you. Better than some weird stranger, right?"
"With a little practice, you could do anything.   Oh..."
"OI' Patty flippin' patties. Who'd a' thunk it, huh?"
Waiting for autumn.
"Leave me Sandra, forget you ever knew me! Erase from your memory the face of this useless sponge! With these......mutilated thumbs!"
And what might that be?
Sandy? Sandy! Sandy come back!  I need you to help me open this jar of peanut butter!  Enough sitting around feeling sorry for myself!
My thumbs are better and I am ready to work!
Well I'm taking it back.
Thumb war.
Never!
Yeeeaaahh!
Oh Patrick!
Yes Patrick?
"Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good."
"Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake.  Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill."
"Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?"
Then why is he in your fist?
"Well, good luck with that. See ya."
"Mr. Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one?"
What's happening to me?  They've shut down the KelpShake restaurants!
"Coming right...down, Squidward."
Mmm...
"Nice catch, Squidward!"
Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found.
Is there a ladder?
"Okay, I—"
Ow!
What?
"Oh, this must be the Lost and Found!  It's not in here!"
"Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost cool guy shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes."
"Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side?"
What a funny echo. Ha...ha.
Hey!  There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws!  I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow!  I love lost novelty items!  Ooh!
Excuse me! Oh!
Ah!
"Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps!  What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom."
Whew!  Whoa!
Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?
Did you drop a box on my head?
Oh!  Hello!
"Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too."
How did you survive down here all this time?
Your breath is delightfully fresh.
"Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!"
Yoink! Losers weepers!
"Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!"
Oh! Lost toys!
Lost Toilets?
Lost Pets!
Lost Mine!
Lost world!
Lost dead ends?!
"No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child!  Huh?  Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!"
Wait! I have a better idea!
Tylo!
Tylosaurus!
"Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!"
"Aww, all the old people are hugging."
"Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish!"
"What's that, Mr. Krabs?"
"Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?"
"Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?"
"I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?"
"Walking to work, huh, Squidward?"
Can I walk with you?
Please?
"Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!"
"Wow, Squidward, how do you know that?"
"Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on."
"I gotta do something.  Okay, Squidward, this should help.  Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you.  I can fix this.  This time, I got ya."
"Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward?"
"Technically, I drove him up the wall."
Present? A present? For me?
"Wow, Squidward! My very own... restraining order. Uh...what is that?"
"Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys-"
Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during serious jail time?
No! I don't wanna go!
"Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to, or get within fifteen feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?"
"Hmm... There we go! Three Krabby Patties, two large Kelpy Colas, and three fries ready to be served.  Hmm?  Oops!  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order."
"Think, SpongeBob, think! Gasp! I got it!"
"Oh no! My two best friends are fighting!  But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off!  I'm sorry, restraining order! But my friends need me!  Stop!"
"Squidward, please don't send me to jail!"
I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Here you go.
I'm not?
"Really, Squidward?"
"Hey, Patrick."
Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
"He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy."
"Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. Dear Sir or Ma'am...  We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience.  Hello?  My package. Whoopee!  Oh, let's see what we got here.  My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row. Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it."
Darn it.
What was that?
"Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me."
"Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble."
"So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers."
Darn it.
"Oh, darn it. Darn it."
Darn it. Darn it.
Darn it.
"Patrick, I..."
I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
"Why are you crying, Patrick?"
Really?
What happened?
"You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk."
"Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?"
How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
A week? Are you sure?
Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
I can't find Gary.
This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
"Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new..."
"Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick."
Gary!
"You check over there. I'll check in here.  Find him yet, Pat?"
But there's nowhere left to look.
I doubt Gary could fit in there.
"Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!"
"Let's see. Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me. Dear Neptune, what have I done?"
Gary.
Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary!
"Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy?"
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I..."
"Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my..."
Gary.
Gary...
This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
"Well, you see..."
"Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me."
"You're right, Mr. Krabs."
"If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it."
"No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary."
"Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do."
"Here's a good spot.  Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob. Quick, hand me the tape."
"Patrick, this is no time for that."
There.
"Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out."
"Pat, no!"
"Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go!"
"I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him."
"Gary loved balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard."
Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
"Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary!  So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?"
"Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving."
Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath: three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next.
Silly Squidward. I'm not going to--
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession...  ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪"
"He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney.  And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat.  That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality.  Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?"
And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals?  Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?
"Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills."
"Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans."
Maybe even a thousand!
"I shall do my Krustiest, sir."
"Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok."
"Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?"
"Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?"
"Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time."
"Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could someone be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity?"
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day."
"You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe."
"Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?"
"Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place."
"Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me!  Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny!  Perfect!  We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!"
"Hey, buddy. Check it out."
But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo!
Kenny!
"Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula.  Thanks, Kenny. You're so real.  Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab?  Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign!  Swoon! Swoon!"
"Mr. the Cat? Everything OK?  Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?"
"Well, I'd best get back manning the grill."
"Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to…  Whoa!"
"How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!"
There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears.
"I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore.  Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? : You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get...  depressed."
"All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone."
"Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?"
"Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career."
"Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special."
Ooh— Ooh— Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?
Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar.  Whaa?  Huh?
I got it covered.
Doink!  Mm. Mm-hmm.  Voilà!
See? This is fun!
Mm-hmm. Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.
"Oh! Oh! Ahh!  Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula?  Ohh!  I put it right here in this circular file cabinet."
Don't say it!
"Oh, I asked you not to say it!  Why would you ever do that?"
Ah! It's alive!
Ahh!  What are we gonna do?
"Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight."
"Ooh, we are gonna pull  a Plankton on Plankton!"
Sorry.  Stepped on my tail.
"I'm a cat burglar!  Okay, I'll change."
Hang on.  Ooh.
Making sure he's asleep.
Yeesh!  Squidward!
"Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!"
"Hmm. Ahh!  Get the stick, boy!  Fetch!"
It's okay. She's in sleep mode.
Good thing I brought this!  They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.
Oh!
I'm fine.
Hmm-mmph.
You okay?
I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!
Heh...sorry.
Ahh.  I can't believe that actually worked!
"We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!"
"No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed!"
"I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs."
Yay!
"Gotta hurry, Gary!  The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary."
"I'm just going to turn out the lights.  Clickety poo! And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?  TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job."
"Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat."
"I'm on it!  Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle.  Kiddies get a free touch-up.  All done!"
No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did.
I was a minute late for work!
A whole 60 seconds.
No! No! You have to punish me!
Aye aye sir.
"I love it here, Mr. Krabs."
"Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock?  Maybe it's my old bed.  Oh, that's it.  I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary?"
"SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir."
"All night, sir."
"That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again."
Here's my first month's rent.
"Already done, sir."
"Done.  All that, before we even open up our doors, sir."
"Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up."
"Ooh. Hi, Squidward."
"Oh, I live here now."
"No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me."
"Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?"
"Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection.  So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar."
Do you want to know where the mustard is?
"Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song."
"Well, they don't see to mind."
"Aye aye, captain."
It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen.  So I moved in here.
"But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!"
"Oh, thank you, Mr...  My parents!"
"Mom! Dad! Come on in.  And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs."
"Well, I'll let you two get settled."
Gary! Bad boy! No!
"Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums!"
"Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?"
"Aye-aye, sir!  Monsieur's change."
"I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?"
Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks!
"Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?"
The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
Ta-da!
"Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!"
Wow! A full house!  There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud!
I gotta get ready!
"Hey, Squid! How about this for the show?  The Amazing Mister Absorbency!  Ta-da!  Ta-da!"
"Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!"
"Oh, yes!"
"So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny!"
"Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side."
"Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?"
"Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?"
"There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye."
"All ready, Mr. Krabs.  Just gotta clock out and..."
"Spot, spot, spot!"
"...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy."
"Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone?"
"Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  You're a tough little guy, aren't ya?  This means war."
"Wait here, please.  Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire!"
That is the last straw! I want you to remember...  you made me do this.
I got to finish this.
"I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the SpotMaster 6000.  Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleansing materials.  I call it...  ...Steel Wool! And it comes with...  ...a laser! Any last words?  Mmm... I thought not.  Power up!"
Water cannon... on!  No effect. Steel wool laser... on!
"OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams!  More power!"
More power!
More power!
Maximum power! Ahhhhh!
"The platter's all clean, Mr. Krabs."
"Good...morning, Gary!"
"Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like?"
"Hey, Patrick, how was your morning?"
"Ooh, take a look a this, Gare Bear. Found a slime ball in your shoe? Even purebred snails call fall victim to the scourge of slime balls."
You really got some air on that one.
"I know that meow. That says, I'm hungry.  Lucky for you, I speak fluent snail."
"What, you're not hungry?"
"Oh, of course.  You wanna go for a walk?  Gary, you really need to work on your pronunciation."
"Okay, no walkies."
"Oh, if only you could talk like a real person.  Huh? Ooh!  The chatterbox translation collar? Know what your best friend is saying! A snail translator! That's a great idea, Gary."
"Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?"
"Ooh, time warp, please!"
"Oh, I wonder where this came from."
"Oh, here we go.  Okay, Gary, speak to me."
"Papa Bob. Oh! Oh, Gary, now you can express you innermost thoughts in language I can understand.  I have so many questions."
What do you dream about?
"Aww, that's sweet."
"Hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right?  Let's move on to question two, shall we? What are your long-term goals?"
"Yeah, you need to get on that. But what I really want to know is,  how do I look in these pants?"
"Oh, Gary, you flatterer. Come on, Gare, let's show Patrick your new voice.  Oh, Patrick, I have got a surprise for you!  Say hello to Gary."
Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar.
Isn't it amazing?
"I think your doorbell's broken, Squidward."
I thought you might want to chat with your neighbor.
"Oh, not to me.  To Gary."
I bought Gary the new pet translator collar.
Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?
Turns out Gary has a very sophisticated sense of design.
"Hey, wait up!"
"Don't worry, Squidward, I'm taking notes for you."
"Don't be sad, Squidward, we'll be back soon."
"Night, Gare Bear."
"At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water.  Here you go, buddy, one water."
"Huh? Oh, sure. No problem, Gary."
"Well, that was fun."
"All right, then.  Here, Gary, take my bed, hmm?"
"Still too—  How's that, Gary?"
"Okay, okay."
This should get things rolling.
"You're right, Gary. The view is nicer over here. Gary?  Gary!"
Whoa!  Oh-whoa-oh! Look out! Look out!
"Whew! Aww, that was close, huh, Gary?  Oops."
"Aww, now where are we gonna sleep?"
"My house! Oh, Squidward, we're neighbors again."
"Uh, I didn't catch that, Squidward, what'd you say?"
"Aww, looks like Squidward wants a pet of his own to talk to."
"♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪"
Sure thing.
Perfection.
"But, Mr. Krabs, I..."
Really?
"Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin."
I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
An insomni-wha?
"Oh, but, sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab."
No Krusty Krab?
"Yes, sir."
"I just don't get it, Gary. I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?"
"Well, I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed!"
This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
"You're right, Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep.  Now, that should do the trick!"
"Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds!  What if I don't get to sleep at all?  Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right!  I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help.  Patrick, Patrick, wake up."
"Oh, yuck! Never mind that, Patrick! I need your help, desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!"
"Oh, boy! A bedtime story!"
"Ah, yay!"
"Mm, sounds like me."
Slumber!
"Aw, thank you, Sir Cecil."
"Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?"
"Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep."
"Um, Patrick, that's..."
"Patrick, this isn't..."
That's a catchy bit...
"That's an excellent number, but..."
Patrick! This isn't helping either!
"Oh, barnacles."
"Patrick, get serious, please!"
"I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?"
Blech!
"Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-"
"Hey, that wasn't too bad. What was it?"
"C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep!"
"Uh-oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding...  Uh-oh.  N-no! No, stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain."
Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Warm Milk, you just tasted so good.  Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you."
"What's this? Another vision?  Oh, why, why? Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!"
"Sir Cecil, the sea sleep king?"
"Hm... it's getting all sleepish around here.  Oh, thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some shut-eye. Now to prepare for work.  Perfect.  Bye, Gary."
Hm?
Huh? Y-Yes... SpongeBob reporting for sleepy and tired.
"Forget..? Oh, right, right, Mr. Krabs. How could I be so forgetful?"
"Employees must wash their hands before cooking.  Oh, that's nice..."
"I know, I know, I just need a quiet place... to nap."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs! I tried, I really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me!"
Is that a good thing?
Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break.  Ahh.
I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo!
That's awesome!
"Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I were making faces at each other."
"Why, is there something wrong?"
I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
Yeah. This is...  easy. How you holding up?
Hey!  Patrick.  Patrick!
Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
"Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces."
Aw!
Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
Doy doy doy doy!
Duh!
Awoot duh doo!
Day ah dah da dah!
"I can't breathe!  Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time."
"Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one...  The Gary. Meow!"
Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea.
It never gets so old!
Mind what? Making faces? Of course were don't.
"Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face."
That's a good one right there.
"Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!"
"Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!"
I can't move my face either!
"No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right!  Patrick, we have the face freeze!"
"Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!"
"And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?"
"Hello, Mr. Krabs."
"Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'..."
"Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny."
That'll buy me some time.
"I'm on it, Squidward!  Onion juice! Ah!"
"Okay, okay.  Ow! Phew. Order up."
Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance.
"Your order is served, sir."
"Oh, dear."
"Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?"
"Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts."
"Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs?  My impersonation of a burrito!"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories."
"Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! you could get the face freeze!"
"Just two more minutes, Patrick."
Look! Here he comes!
"Thank you, Mr. Ranger."
Aren't you forgetting something?
"Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot."
"Patrick, guess what?"
"Yes, yes, how did you guess?"
Let's just start with the song.
That's the one.
"♪jellyfishing in da' afternoon,♪"
Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?
Big sign? I didn't see a big- Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!
Super highway!? Do you know what this means?!
"I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel--ds, uh sorry."
"Well yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that,  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, Shelly Super Highway, from ever being built!"
"Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!"
"Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway!  Hmmm."
Too busy doing what?
"Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy."
I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields.
"Really, Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!"
"Yeah, why?"
Charts and dia- Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?
"This.  According to these plans. After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Look, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it goes through a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!"
"Plan approved by &amp; sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"
Think this piece will get the point across?
Why not!?
Not that!
"We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid."
Huh?
Why?
"What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?"
"Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!"
"It means, you hate tambourines?"
"Yes sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and-"
What for?
"But, my grandma gave me this sitar! It didn't come with a license."
What was that?
"I know what a freedom march is Patrick! I mean, what did he say?"
"Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened to him after he was arrested?"
Bye!
See you later!
Thanks for the lift!
"They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!"
"Well, at least it isn't raining!"
I'm not ready to give up just yet!
"If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!"
"Oh a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?"
That certainly is a parade!
"Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick."
C'mon! Let's go follow them!
"I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first!"
Is that all you got?
"Knock it off, Patrick."
"Yeah, but this is more like highway excess!"
"uh, Squidward, it's technically its a super-highway."
But Squidward-
"I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!"
"Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?"
It can't?
Zed-9er9er!?
Tell me I'm dreaming!
"First I lost Jellyfish Fields, and- and......"
And now I lost the only job I ever wanted!
Squidward Look!
All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!
"Aw, ya don't?"
Ah! Now they'll have to listen!
"Well, okay, I guess. Sorry I am a little nervous."
"Well, all I have to say is that, um, well,  Stop the madness! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat, so they will be in peace. And balance will once again restore to their natural land. So what do you say everybody, will you help me?"
"You're kidding, right?"
"Well all right! Everybody, follow me."
"Okay everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to this town since 97 cent stores."
Larry Lobster!
Sandy Squirrel!
Mrs. Puff!
Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy!
Patrick!
And Squidward!
Harder still!
"Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jelly fishing song!"
"Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!"
"♪Going on down to Boating School! Boating School! Boating School! Going on down to Boating School! Rea de de la Mrs. Puff!♪  For me? Well on behalf on yours truly, I would like to thank each of you for such a wonderful and warm welcome.  Thank you.  Thank you sir."
"Mrs. Puff, thank you most of all!"
It wasn't?
"Then, who was it for?"
"It's Tony Fast! The famous race boat driver!  And his first born son, Tony Fast Jr.!"
I can't believe that I'm in the presence of such big celebrities.
Mrs. Puff?
What does Incorrigible mean?
It's nice to finally meet you Tony Fast Jr!
"Okay! Uh, roll? Roll!? Roll!? Is there a button for that?  I know I know this! It's around here somewhere! I-"
Just driving!  W-w-w-what do these dotted lines mean?
Relax... relax? Mrs. Puff hasn't taught us that yet!
Okay... just relaxing... and... relaxing! Relaxing! So hard!  Raw! I cant' relax!
Let go?
Be cool?
Be... cool...  Cool...
I can see that! And I'm eager to learn more from you!
Yeah!
None taken!
Oh! I'll be delighted to!
It's SpongeBob SquarePants!
"SpongeBob, SquarePants!  Tony Fast Jr.!"
Nice place you got here Tony Jr.!
"Oh! Uh, what does that mean?"
Oh would I?
Wow! They're so shiny!
My favorite? Oh I couldn't!
This one!
A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!
Wow Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!
"Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous..."
Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves!  Sorry sir!
Let go... got it!  Whee!
Faster?
Eh... if you say so!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!
Whee... red light!
Thanks TFJ...
"Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! Ah ha ha ha!"
"Right here, right now? A little short notice...  let me check my availability.  Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!"
"However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline!"
I don't hear anything...
"I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!"
Grr... Grr!
Grr!
We're winning! We're winning!
Huh? Oh no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do?
Now there's a helicopter after us!
What're we going to do!?
Now your dad is after us!
How should I know? He's your dad!
"Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far? Huh, Tony Jr?"
Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?
"Ah, time for bed, Gary."
"Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!"
No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
"This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?"
Gary?
Gary! You can talk!
What does that mean?
Who?
"Gee, Gary, you sure are smart."
"Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now."
"I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!"
"You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want."
I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
"Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream."
"Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!"
Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
"Trust me, Squidward."
La la! La la la la la la la!
"So long, Squidward!"
"Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder..."
"Hey, Sandy! What's going on?"
This seems kind of dangerous!
Okay!
Gotcha!
"Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?"
"Oh, Pearl. This is your dream."
"Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream."
Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.
"Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?"
What are you talking about?
"Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!"
This one?
"Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs."
"Net ready, sir!"
"Congratulations, Mr. Krabs."
Huh?
Hey! Hey! I...!
"This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?"
"Yes, Mr. Krabs?"
"Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom."
Plankton!
This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary! Gary! No!
"Gary!  I've got you, Gary!"
I think he's got the point.
"Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah..."
What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no!
"Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?"
"I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs."
Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
Um...
"Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast."
Oh!
Woo-hoo!
Sorry.
"Hey, I was still reading that!"
"I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!"
"Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up!"
Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all.
"37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties?  Huh, has my spatula always had three heads?"
"Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking."
"Whoa, my spatula never did that before."
"Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs!  I'm trying!  Come on, you, work!"
"Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!"
What is going on around here?
"Hey, what's this?  Whoa! My spatula is magic!"
This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone.
"I'll help you, baby! Boing!"
"There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea!  Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish!"
"Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea."
"Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!"
I can fix this!
I think I know a way to make you both happy.
"Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!"
"Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything."
No sponge should have this much power.
Not helping!
My spatula! T-Then what's this?
"Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore."
Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me.
Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!
Ahh! Make it stop!
Really?
"Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know."
Let's get 'em!
"Hi, Squidward."
"Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you."
Gary's not misbehaved!
But there does appear to be something wrong with him.
"Oh, of course."
Affirmatory.
Yup.
Yupie.
"Yup, yup, yup."
Uhh...
Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!
Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.
"But, Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob."
Could a voracious flesh-eater do this?
That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.
Huh?
"Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet?"
"Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy."
All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail.  Gary...  How could you?
No! Don't hurt him!
No! I won't let you touch Gary!
S.D.E. and S.E.?
"Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?"
"Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?"
"Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?"
"Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win."
We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
"You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend."
I think we better raise the bar.
"We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward."
"You kidder. Let's go, Patrick."
"Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward."
Yep.
"You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward."
"How'd the audition go, Squidward?"
"Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?"
"Yes, yes I am."
Ready!
How'd you know?
I guess they're happy.
"Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help."
"Well, I just..."
"You know what, Squidward?"
I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.
"Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight."
"Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent."
"Uh, Squidward?"
"Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?"
"Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone."
"I love your new dance, Patrick."
And it's gonna eat us!
Survival training camp?! Patrick and I love camping!
Hey!
"We'll have you know that just the other day, Squidward commented at our survival skills!  The Other Day"
"Thank you, Squidward!"
Sshhh! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!  I guess the road smoothed out.  That was a close one Patrick! We were almost left in the wilderness... without Sandy! And nobody would have known where to find us!
"No, Patrick! No!  Sandy, wait! Sandy! Sandy! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll pitch the tent while you start a campfire. Then when we're all settled, I'll cook us up some grub.  Okay Patrick, we're all set! We have fresh water, a rugged tent for shelter..."
"Say, where did you get the firewood?  You burned our food supply?! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something!  Hey Patrick, nice job."
"Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burned our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we are going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!"
Okay. Here's the plan...
"Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do?"
"Uh, Patrick?"
"Sorry, sorry, take your time."
No hurry Patrick.
Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there.
"I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves."
"Huh? Nice. We'll only stay here tonight, and head home tomorrow."
What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?
We'll be here forever? We're doomed!
"You're right Patrick, but what will we eat, where will we sleep?"
"Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home.  There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom...only, smaller,  comfy, safe and sound in my own little home."
Patrick?  Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me.
He's got the taste of flesh!
"Hey, Patrick."
Sounds like you're hungry.
It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?
"This mud replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend Patrick!  He's onto me! Must hide! . Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, , I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here!  Spatula.  Now I just need some buns.  Oh, crunchy.  I can't take it!  I need some real food!"
Yyyess! Yyeess! I shall eat Patrick before he eats meee!
I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!
"I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!"
"Oh, no you don't!  Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this?  Warm water?"
"Ah, thanks, Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?"
"Thanks, Patrick! You're a real pal!  Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. Carrots?! You're making soup out of me!"
"Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed?  There, that's it. Here, I'll tuck you in with this nice soft blanket , and what's a little blanket without a little ketchup?"
Wait! Come back! You're not properly seasoned!
No!
Gotcha!
I got you!
Did what?
"Wow! It's great that we've won our medals, but I'm still hungry."
"What about Patrick? Does he have to find his own flowers, too?"
"Patrick, that's not a nose, that's a...  ...hermit crab."
It's not so abnormal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.
"Well, Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face?"
"All right, Patrick, let's unveil the new schnoze!"
"There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy!  Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose."
"Hiya, Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good."
"1, 2, 3, 4...  Come on, SquarePants, be a man!"
"Patrick, help!"
I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.
"Come on, SpongeBob, be a man!  Mr. Krabs?"
It is not Patrick's fault!
"It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!  Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom.  With a little raw sewage for good measure."
"Yes, sir!"
"Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. R.I.P.  Well, this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it."
Order up!
Baby's first Krabby Patty.
Yi-eeh! That's harsh.
"Mr. Krabs, no! Don't do it!"
Plankton!  I have the perfect solution to your problem.
You should try the local animal shelter. That's where I found my Gary.
"Here it is. The Bikini Bottom Animal Shelter.  Your perfect pet awaits. Now, if you just listen to your heart, you'll be able to pick out the right pet as soon as you see it."
"Hey, Patrick.  Oh! Oh! What about this one?"
"Oh, no! Plankton!"
"Oh, so cute! Whatcha gonna call him? He looks like a Spot to me."
"Why, Plankton, what's wrong?"
"That's terrible! Gary lost me once.  I was cold, alone, starving. It was the worst eight minutes of my life. Come on, Plankton, let's find your pet."
"Lost pet! Anyone seen this lost pet?  Lost pet emergency! Be on the lookout for a lost pet! Pardon me, sir.  Have you seen this amoeba?"
No. That little speck.
"I think it's closed for the night.  Ooh, it's dark in here. I'll find a light switch. Aha!  Nope, that's not it.  Aha! Found the lights."
I don't know. I think it unlocks the pens?
Run for it?
I think we lost 'em.
"Aw, it was nothing. Hey, speaking of Spot. Did you always have a double pupil?"
"Aw, I'm glad you found Spot.  Unfortunately, the animals found us too."
"Wow, Spot! You saved us!"
"Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home."
"I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs.  Grilling is my passion."
"18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe."
I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
Why?
Wow! You and me go on strike?
Right!
Right!
Right!
"Yay! A strike!  ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪  Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah!"
"Yeah!  Noo...  No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I...  Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick."
Sorry.
And more?
"I can't do it, Squidward! This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me."
"Like this, Squidward?"
How's this?
"How about this, Squidward?"
At the Krusty Krab.
Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
Yep!
"Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?"
"I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?"
"Like this, Squidward?"
"Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing."
"That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands."
"Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?"
"Yeah, that, too!"
And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
"Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day.  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?"
"Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action!  I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board!  I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business!  Squidward will be so proud!"
"I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure."
Here it comes!
"Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!"
"Uh, Patrick?"
"Oh, that's probably your conscience."
No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something  that's wrong.
Now that's a smart little sea star.
I got it.
Nothing.
"I'll take that, thank you."
Okie-dokie!
I got it.
"Dear diary, what an amazing day I've...  ...day I've had.  This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward.  He had some very important news he was just bursting to share.  He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet.  Specifically, what not to feed them.  The list was very thorough.  Needless to say, this is all very enlightening.  It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique--  Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are.  Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short.  And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year,  cleaning day!  Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab,  and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots.  Ah yes, cleaning day."
"Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right.  Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible."
"Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been.  Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him."
Duty calls.
I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--
And that guy.
P-p-p-p-plaid?
"Avert your eyes, SquarePants.  I have to take my break!"
"I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?"
"Oh, sure thing.  Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?"
My... Diary! Squidward! How could you?!
"Hi, Squidward. How's it going?"
What for?
"Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you.  Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary.  Now, that would have been really embarrassing."
"People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward."
Squidward! How could you?!
"Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone.  He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is.  This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot.  Would you like to see a menu, Monsieur?  Ow!"
"Okay, little guy, see you later.  Good thing he is a little guy. Ouch."
"What the shrimp?  Hey, what's going on here?  Whoa! That's too hot!  Whooaaa!!!  Wow.  Oops."
I steamed myself tiny. Whoo-hoo! I steamed myself tiny! Whoo!  This place is huge!  My spatula's huge! And just look at the size of my grill. It's huge!  Ow!
Ow!
"Come on, flip! Whoa!"
"Uh-oh. The grill blew out. Well,  it isn't gonna fix itself.  That's one small step for SpongeBob, one giant leap for—  Whee!!  Whoa!  Bob.  Whew!  Whoa!"
What is that?
"Hey, it's my little urchin friend. Aww, hey, little guy, don't cry. Your old pal, WheeBob, will get ya outta there."
"Little urchin, you are free to go! You okay?"
Yeouch!
Sorry little guy!  Whoa!
"Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Follow the pipes to freedom, little guy! I'll never forget you.  Really.  Ow! What is all that noise?"
Comin' right up!
"No! No, Mr. Krabs! It's meeee!!!!  Whoa-ho!"
Ooh!  That tickles.
"Oh, hi, Karen. Where's Plankton?"
"Hi, Plankton!"
"I didn't mean to get small like you, Plankton. It was a freak accident."
Hooray!  I'll get that.
Oops.
Whoa!!
Bleach!
Whoa! You can't catch me!
SpongeBob in the corner pocket! Doink!
Peekaboo!
"Sorry, Mr. K. I shrunk myself by mistake. But I won't let it affect my job. I will get back to flippin' right now."
"Oh, please, Mr. Krabs! There must be some job I could do! I don't care what it is! Please, please, please!"
Whoa!  That's big money!  Whoa!
Whoo-hoo! Yay!
Whew!
"It's okay, Squidward! I'll make the patties for you—oh. Yeah. I forgot. I'm too little.  Boy, I'm really gonna miss my old job."
The bubbles are making me bigger! More bubbles!
"Thank you, Squidward! I'm big enough to flip patties again!  Oh-ho-ho!"
"No need to call 'em, Mr. Krabs.  We'll be there in five minutes depending on traffic."
Umm... What day is it today?
"But, Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?"
I was spying on you.
"Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero!"
"Whoo, that's good, 'cause I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend."
"No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it."
Okay.
"Well, it all looked kinda faded."
"You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?"
Okay.
‘Cause you keep saying “ow”!
"Wow, Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now."
"Roger!  Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power."
"Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off."
"Thank you, Patrick!"
"Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help you redecorate. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed."
"Oops.  Doink.  I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh?  Huh, I don't remember making such a mess.  And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti.  Nope.  Huh?"
"Oh, hey, Patrick.  Wake up, Patrick!  Whoa!"
Whoa!
"Patrick, no!"
No!
Whew.
Shh! Shhh!
Uh-huh. Phew.
Ooh!  Ow!
Bleach!  Ow!
"No, Patrick, no!  Don't!"
Huh?
Ohh!
Whoa!
"Oh, brother."
"And a good morning to you, Mr. Krabs.  Whoa, it's so pretty."
"I'm going home for my lunch break, Mr. Krabs!"
"Ooh, huh?"
Huh?
Ooh.
"Hey, there's writing on this.  Rub bottle for magic genie. Magic genie! I found a genie!"
"Oh, yeah! Hi, genie! Are you really a genie?"
"You silly genie, you. You know it doesn't work like that. I'm your master now, and you have to grant me three wishes."
"Oh, nothing for me, thank you. That would be selfish. But I will make three wishes for my friends. Friendship is magical too."
"Well now it's your lucky day off. Make a wish, and the genie shall make it come true."
Say it. Mm!
Yeah!
Huh? Genie?
My next friend is my best friend.
Aww.
"Oh, hello, Noggin. Nice to meet you."
"Oh, he doesn't have to—"
"No, it's okay, Patrick."
"Of course, I was saving my last wish for good ol' Mr. Krabs."
"And so this would be the third and last wish I have, and it's all for you."
"But it's a real genie, and I—I saved the last wish for you."
"Hey, look, a penny!"
"No, Mr. Krabs! Oh, don't you all see? We shouldn't be fighting. Today we found out that magic is real. And that magic is magical and that magic makes you feel all sparkly and  carbonated inside."
That's easy. We're gonna play a little game called Spin The Bottle!
So the rules are whichever one the bottle points to...
"No, Patrick, they will win the bottle."
And spin!
"Hey, you guys, I—huh? Hmm, guess they worked it out. It's so heartwarming to live in a world with real magic. And the greatest magic of all is the way my friends are so close to each other."
"Yuck, this bottle of ketchup's gone bad."
"Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do."
"Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?"
Squidward! You need bed rest!  I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
"Uhh, Wednesday?"
Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
"Oh, a game."
Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
"I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!"
"Gary! It's Opposite Day and I...  ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day.  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?"
"Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?"
Company! I hate company. ‘’’’Who's there?
Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again!
"That's right! You're my worst enemy!  Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!"
You have?
"Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite."
"Patrick! Patrick, breathe!  Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!"
Meow.
Kcirtap yeh.
Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot!
"Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?"
"Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day...  ...terrible?"
Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!
On Opposite Day it is.
"I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!"
"Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better.  Now you try."
"After you, Mr. Squidward."
"You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward."
"Yes, please come in."
"Yeah, everyone says that."
"Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft."
"Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?"
Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
"I'm Squidward, he's Squidward."
Okay.
I hear you loud and clear.
Don't...
"Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?!"
"Good morning, Squidward!"
I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
"My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for."
"What's that, Squidward?"
"Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgot his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him.  Man this is heavy.  Oh, pardon me."
AHH!!! Monster!
Ooooooohhhhh!
To inaugurate you as president.
You're the president of The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge!
It's a secret.
"What color should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?"
Yeah.
"Whenever you're ready, Patrick."
"Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake."
"Okay! I'm ready!  Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot."
"Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the-"
"Yeah, our president sure knows how to live.  I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick.  Okay…Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward, you home?"
Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
I hope he's not in danger.
"As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger."
"Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward."
We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
"Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips?"
"Squidward, does that include…"
"Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?"
"Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right."
"C'mon, let's go."
President Squidward?
We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
It's like a carnival ride!
"We gotta turn this thing off.  Nope, not it."
Nope.
"Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?"
Mr. President-
But we just wanted to…
"Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!"
"Dinnertime, Gary! And it's your favorite flavor—crushed anemone byproducts and krill.  What is that horrific banging?  Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!"
"Oh, he's crying out for help!"
"Gary, this is even worse than yesterday!"
Noooo! Why?! Why?! Why?!  Why?!  It was horrible.  Patrick! Patrick!
"I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten."
I would be delighted to meet him.
Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me.
"And you are?  Nice to meet you, Mr. Rrarrg!  Well, Rrarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home."
"Where is your home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home."
"Oh, he smashed your house!"
"He's going to smash my house?! Gary!  Gary! Jump, Gary, jump!  Parachute, Gary! Use your parachute!"
"Uh, Patrick, I don't--"
"And they built a cute little fence around Rrarrg.  Hi, Squidward, you're home early."
"He waved at you, Squidward! That means he likes you!"
"Yeah, crushes. Patrick, crushes! That gives me an idea!"
"Your ice cubes, sir."
Don't thank me. Thank Rrarrg!
"Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would?"
A donut this nice could really make a guy happy!
"Hey, Patrick."
"Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?"
"That's exactly how I feel about it.  Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again."
"I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over.  Sheesh, Patrick's so excited, I better not keep him waiting!"
"Hey, Patrick, I-  Donut! You monster...! You monster!  Nothing goes with a video like toast! Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy!"
"Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go!"
"Hey, Patrick!"
Are you ready to-
Okay... No problem. Ready to see this?  The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy?
"Oh, Patrick! You really need to see this video!  I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy..."
Of course! It was your birthday!
"Last night, silly!"
"Sure, pal!"
What a beautiful day.
Can you believe that sun?
"Uhh, Patrick?"
Nothing.
I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?
"Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard!"
What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool!
"Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  And live!"
Lifeguard?
White stuff! You think I'm a lifeguard?
You really think so?
I'd love it!
Hi.
"It works!  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry!"
By myself?
"I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddy."
Action?
"But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes!  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!  Uhh... there are sharks in there!"
Uhh... sea monster!
"Uhh, somebody went?  No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.  But just so you're not tempted...  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed."
Does Larry ever give you  free ice cream?
"Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed."
"If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them."
Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.
They would have to have crossed the line.
"Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that...  ...Patrick isn't drowning!"
"Hold on, Patrick!  I'm coming!"
Don't move!  Catch this!
"Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think.  Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think.  I've got it!  Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water!  Well, you're safe now, Patrick."
"Sorry! Here's your hot dog.  Okay, Patrick, here I come!  Come, come round, Pat. Here I am."
"Goodbye, Patrick!"
"Yes, Larry?"
"No, Larry."
"Um, sir, I believe I was in line first.  I spent the night! That's how you get the best spot around here!  I'm meeting my best friend for an exciting day at Glove World!.  See? Glove World! I promised Patrick we'd be first in line for the first bus to Glove World!."
"But I spend the night so that I could... uh... Okay, I guess. ."
"I'm sorry, Patrick. But, we'll still be on the first bus to Glove World!"
Glove World! Glove World! Glove World!
Sandy!
"Gosh, Sandy, I'd like to, but I'll miss the first bus to Glove World!."
"Oh, okay! Patrick, I'll catch the next bus! See you there!"
"But, Mr. Krabs, today's my day off!"
Um. Pearl? About those shoes? No.
"Grandma? Oh... coming, Grandma."
"Oh, Patrick, I tried, how I tried! But everyone needed my help and I, uh..."
"Oh, sure."
"Oh, it's true, Gare-bear! It's true!"
"It's true that I can't stand up for myself. I'm too soft! Oh, I wish I had thicker skin!"
"Hey, what's this?  Don't throw out that old too soft sponge, toughen it with a new abrasive side!  Say! Gary, did you order this for me?"
"Ah, it fits like a glove!"
"Thanks, Gary! You're always there for me! Huh, I wonder how this thing works."
Why don't ya scram you little freeloader?  Hmph! Bottomfeeder!
"See ya, Gary!"
"♪I've got an abrasive side! Abrasive side, abrasive side! I've got an abrasive side, and now I can say no! Abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side, abrasive side! Now I can say --♪"
No.
"Carry 'em yourself, fishface!"
Don't you think you've had enough? All you're missing is a bowl of butter!
"Hey, Grandma."
"I've got an abrasive side, now!"
"Sorry, Granny, why don't you walk yourself across the street."
"Have a nice day, Grandma."
"Why certainly, Sa-"
"No can do, ya brainless lab rat! I have better things to do than to be your test monkey!"
"Oh, sure thing, Mr..."
"Sorry, Krabs. I'm busy! Unless you're paying me overtime."
"'Fraid not, Schnozward! I wouldn't hang out with you for all the money in Krabs' mattress!"
"Oh, I can't wait..."
...to ditch you...
...’cause you're my best friend...
"...so beat it, tubby, I don't care for your company!"
"Well, Patrick, are you ready to have some fun?"
That's weird. I wonder what's wrong with Patrick.
"Don't you remember? We told that pink freak to beat it! In fact, we've already insulted all of your rotten friends, and no one will hang out with you, 'cause you have no friends left, Mr. LoserBob LonelyPants!"
Oh no! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick Patrick Patrick!
"Yes, Patrick, help me get this abrasive side off my back! You'll help me, won't you, buddy?"
"Patrick, you know the answer to that question is-"
No! Why would I want to be friends with a big loser like you?
It happened again!
Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
"But, Mr. Krabs, I would never use immoderate language like..."
Overtime!
"Sandy, please help me! Gary ordered me an abrasive side so that I could be more assertive."
"Hey, Chipmunk!"
"And now, it's taken over!"
"Quiet, you!"
I can't take it anymore! It's like a... a virus!
Hold on.
"Well, I just couldn't say..."
No!
To anybody. So I got this abrasive side to help change my personality.
Who he is just stinks!
"No, you don't scare me, Girly!"
"Hey, what are you doing, you crazy bushy-tailed rodent?! Hey!"
"Phew. Thank you, Sandy! You too, Patrick!"
"So long, Abrasivey!  Grandma! I've got to apologize to Grandma!  Grandma? Hello, Grandma, I'm sorry about earlier. So, what do ya say? Can we discuss forgiveness over a cup of your famous hot cocoa?"
No!
"Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs?"
"Plankton?!  But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy!  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years!"
Why would you play cards with him?
"Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?"
"Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?"
Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
"Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!"
What?
"Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties."
"Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke."
"But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab!"
Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs!
What is this place?
"Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh..."
"The sign says kitchen, but my heart says jail. ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪"
"♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪"
♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪
♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪
"I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!"
Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
"Well, I usually cook on a grill."
"Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way."
A little more to the left.
Move it over a little more.
Keep going.
"Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right."
"It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!"
Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!
Well...
Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream!
Faster! Faster! Faster!
All this preparation is making me hungry.
Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
"No, I don't really feel like it!"
"Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!"
No!
Do ba da ma!
Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?
Get welded.
I don't wanna.
"My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs."
"I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby?  I mean...I'm working all day for free! My treat!"
"Wake up, Gary."
We're moving today!
That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!
"No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!"
"Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!"
"Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!!  ...To me!"
"Yeah, but he told us to tell you..."
He told me to tell you... April Fools.
"Squidward, wait!"
"Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!"
"Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?"
"They're riiiight here, lady!"
APRIL FOOLS!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
"Hey, what's that?"
April Fools!! I'm right here!!
Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.
April Fools!
I...  I...
"You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one!"
"Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  APRIL FOOOOOLS!"
"Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up!"
Whooaahh!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl...
Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
...Ohhh!&#160;:(
What do you want?
What?
What?!
I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
But I couldn't...
Squidward! Is all that true?
Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
I promise.
What would we do without Squidward?
"Oh, oh."
Whoa.
"Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream."
"Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?"
"Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps."
"Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them."
"Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!"
"Oh, uh, Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice."
Me!
"Oh, me, me!"
"Hey, that was my slogan."
I—oh...
"Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?"
But what is filler?
"Hey, why does that barrel say sand?"
Mr. Krabs?
"Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?"
"Hooray, finally!"
Making Krabby Patties.
You mean my last one for the morning rush?
You mean my last one for today-ever?
Fired?
"Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything."
You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
"Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?"
"Ahem,  hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."
"Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop."
I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again.
"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me."
"Hey, Patrick."
"Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?"
"I'll come with you, SpongeBob."
Aww.
"Whoa, oof!"
Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
"Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?"
"Yeah, sure. I get it."
"Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties."
"Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!"
Aww.
Welcome to the original Krusty—
"That'll be $1.99, please."
Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!
"Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?"
"Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either."
Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
"Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick."
"Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship."
Patrick!
"Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!"
"Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!"
Missed you.
"I got something for you, from one friend to another."
"Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty."
"Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach."
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
"Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped."
"The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh."
"Go on, have a bite."
"Mr. Krabs, just a nibble."
"Nothing, we're not selling them."
Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
Yoo-hoo!  Who wants their tummies tickled?
"Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton.  They're furry buckets of love.  See?  And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles?  Jellyfish honey!"
Come and get it!
"I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs."
"Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy!  No... disrespect for your new bride."
Would you like our house red or or house yellow?
"Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs"
It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here.
Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
"Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!"
Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
"Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!"
"Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!"
All right!  Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night.  You mean outside?
"I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there."
You're right!  FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB!  AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh!  Piece of cake.
"Pfft, nah."
What? What do I know?
"Tell me, tell me!"
"What happened, what happened, what happened!?"
The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
"The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging,  The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa."
Tell me the story!
He forgot the secret sauce?
He didn't wash his hands?
Irregular portions?
"You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or..."
So?
"OH, NO!!!"
Tuesday.
But tonight's Tuesday night!
How will we know?
No.
What?
What?
"WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!"
What?
It's not?
Ohhhhh...
"Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day."
What?
"Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?"
"Nice try, Squidward."
"The phone will ring and there will be no one there.  Oh, you crack me up."
I didn't know the buses ran this late.
"Well, they're dropping someone off."
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
"No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me!"
He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
"Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!"
Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
Do you have references?
Huh?  Whoa-boing!  Hah! Sunny skies all week?  Hot diggity!  Rain.  But-but Gale Doppler is never wrong. Huh? Hm.
"What...?  Hm?  Aw, it's a little baby storm cloud. Hello, little cloud. Nice to meet you."
"Oh, you're crying. I thought you were raining."
"Oh, now don't be scared. SpongeBob knows just what a growing storm cloud needs.  Hot steam."
"Well, okay, I don't see any clouds, so I'm just gonna take a walk."
"Tut-tut, it looks like rain. Hah!  Oh, hello there.  Aw, who's a cute cumulous?  I always wanted to have a pet cloud formation. I gonna name you...  Drizzle."
"Hey, good visibility!"
And gusty winds from the southeast.
Um. A clam eating a telephone.
A fur chandelier!
A lamp!
A shoe factory!
A continental breakfast!
A chicken!
"Oh, I am so good at this."
Sorry. Ee...
"Bad Drizzle. Bad.  Well, all right, not that bad. Okay, let's go home."
"I'm sorry, Drizzle, but you can't go in the house until you're housebroken."
I'll check on you later.
"It's later!  Who wants a steaming hot bowl of steam?  Ah! Drizzle!  Yow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Where art thou, Drizzle? Oh, what unfortunate forecast be this?  Oh, wait. There he goes. Come back, Drizzle! Come back!"
"Drizzle! Drizzle, where are you? Excuse me. Have you seen a little storm cloud about yea big?"
"Drizzle! Drizzle! Drizzle!  Oh, there you are, Drizzle.  Gale Doppler!  You're my favorite well-eyed weather man! Oh, thanks for finding my lost pet, Mr. Doppler. Time to go home, Drizzle."
"Hey, Doppler.  You're not the only one who knows how to use a leaf blower, sucker."
"We did it, Drizzle. We put a stoppler to the doppler. And I predict sunny skies for the rest of our lives."
"Please, Mr. Doppler, don't send Drizzle to cloud heaven!"
"Phew, that's a relief."
"Dissolve him?! What?!  Please, Mr. Doppler! Drizzle's a good cloud! He doesn't deserve to dissolve!"
Drizzle!
Uh-oh.
"Excuse me, Drizzle. I don't mean to parade on your rain, but could you please put Gale down?"
"Whoa!  Huh? Oh, no! Not more storm clouds."
"Holy hurricane, they're Drizzle's parents!"
"Good-bye, my little foul weather friend. I'll never forget you, come rain or shine."
"Aw, thank you, Drizzle. Don't worry, I'll water him and walk him every day."
"Bye!  Aw, I'm gonna name you Drizzle Jr.  And I know just where to keep you too."
"Good morning, Drizzle Jr. Not too hot but not too cold."
"97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that?  Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something."
Breathing.
Okay!
"I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday.  Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--"
Coffee rain!
"Chocolate rain!  Squidward!  Squidward, wait!"
Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward?
"You left your keys on the table back there.  Hey, Squidward?"
Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?
Why?
"Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward."
"Oh, Squidward!"
"Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here."
"Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can."
"Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy."
"Oh, I am here because I."
"Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here."
Do you like it Squidward?
"Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy?"
"Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?"
"Uh, step on the gas?"
"I got it, I got it."
"Hey, where'd Squidward go?"
"Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-"
"Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it."
"You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me."
Before what?
Yay!
"Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.  But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school!"
"♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward?  Squidward, are you okay?"
"Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!"
It's Squidward!
What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?
These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!
Yeah! Way to go!
Do we get to join the lodge?
Huh! How did you know?
Maybe he got to join the lodge!
Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?
"Hey, where's Squidward?"
You still have your robes.
"Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in."
"We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault."
"No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick."
No. You can't set foot in the lodge.
"Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"
"That's it!  Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?"
"Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?"
"So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation."
Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.
Not the way we do it.
"Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push."
Let's move.
"Okay, we can let him out now."
"Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for..."
A very special initiation.
"Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?"
"Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow!  Brother Patrick."
They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends.
Somebody already had Feather Buddies.
Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?
"Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it.  Everything we need is in this drawer."
"Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!"
It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery.
Roar!
Roar!
"Way to go, Squidward."
"Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends."
"Sir, yes, sir!"
And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support?  Squidward?
"Hello, Mrs. Puff!"
I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!
"Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?"
"Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab?"
"Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this."
"Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?"
"Sir, where did you get this?"
This must be Plankton's dirty plan.  Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
Delicious!
"Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty."
"Plankton, I'm sorry.  Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious."
But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be low enough to do that?
Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day.
Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!
"Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward?  Squidward?"
So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?
"Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, dear."
"But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe."
What can I get for you... handsome?
"Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything."
"Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir!"
The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite.
More Diet Red Tide?
And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
"He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!"
Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
Duped!
We've been smeckledorfed!
I bet he bites whale bubbles.
It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
"Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!"
I call it the 'Nasty Patty'.
"Here you are, sir, enjoy."
"Phew! That's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it."
"Why, sir?"
"Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do!?"
But you told me to give it to him!
"You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me."
"Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y!  Eww... eww..."
"Yes, sir."
There's a big rock in the way!
"Aye aye, sir!"
"What do you mean, Mr. Krabs?"
"Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I thought he might need some air."
Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
"What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why... why... why?!"
"Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!"
Can I lose my cool now?
"Oh, Neptune! Get away!  Ooh...ahh-ahh...  A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk."
Ahh...
"I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo..."
"Oh, man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?!"
"Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go put my hat in the freezer now."
"The dark deed you requested is done, sir."
What?! You can't pin this whole rap on me!
It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
He wears curlers to bed!
AHHHH!!!! IT'S A ZOMBIE!!!!
"Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!"
Patrick!
"What are you doing out here, silly?"
"That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work."
"I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy."
"Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then."
"What's shakin', Mr. K?"
"Oh, he is good."
"What's the matter, Patrick?"
He's nervous.
Patrick.
Are you okay?
"Come on, Patrick. Easy now. Right this way."
"Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home."
"Hey, hat man... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?"
"Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something!  Okay, that's it! No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck! I'm gonna go have a talk with him right-"
"Okay, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing."
Just be careful.
I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him.
Patrick!
"Mr. Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!"
"Oh, I can't watch!"
So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!
"Patrick, you okay?"
"It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want."
"Sure thing, pal."
"Anytime, pal! Anytime!"
"What is your emergency, Sir?  Oh, hi, Plankton."
"Don't worry, Sir... No matter what the emergency, I've seen it all before."
I've never seen that before!
"Well, maybe we can talk to it."
"Oh, I can't do it, I can't shoot the glove!  It's – it's wiggling..."
"I'm helping.  Listen to me, Plankton. You can't fight a big monster like that with hate. You can only defeat them with love."
But only love will defeat the glove!
"Oh, look, they're playing rock-paper-scissors!  One, two, three!"
"Oh, except rock..."
"Oh my goodness, it's a thumb war!"
"Diversion, eh?"
"I am a bullhorn, stat!"
"Aww, they fit each other just like a glove."
I sure am!  I'm ready!
"Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move."
"What diabolical act is she committing now?  Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire!  Huh? So I guess there's no fire?"
Christmas who?
Is she a friend from Texas?
Tell me more about this...  ...Christmas.
And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
"But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you."
"That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter."
"Okay, who's next?"
"Here you go, Patrick."
Not yet.
"C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter."
"Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward."
"Here, Patrick, watch me.  Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!"
Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
"Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?"
Really?
"What did you wish for, Patrick?"
"And what did you wish for, little girl?"
"Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?"
"Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival."
♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!♪
"Ah, well that's the last letter. Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet!  Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry!"
"Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started.  Dear Santa Claus..."
"Right, too formal. Hi Santa..."
"Howdy, Claus?"
"But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift."
"C’mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?"
"Squidward, c'mon."
"C'mon, Squidward. C'mon!"
C'mon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here.
"Uh, he should be here any minute. ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪"
"Hey, guys, where's your Christmas spirit? He's just running late."
Yeah!
Santa Claus.
"You were right, Squidward. This was a stupid holiday.  I still want you to have this."
A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came!
You're welcome.
I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better.
I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place.
Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?
Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?
C-c-could it be?
"Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San..."
S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta...
S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
"I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?"
Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
"And what about that nose?  I knew you were supposed to have a big one, but that thing's gigantic."
Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
I did?
"Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down."
"Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small, but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward..."
"Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!"
"Hooray!  Oh, a storm!"
"Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs?"
"What do you think the surprise is, Patrick?"
"I don't know. What do you...  Ohhh. Whatever it is, it's really big."
And it smells angry.
You peek first.
"Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us."
The act?
Wow. Looks like those Iron Bun workout videos are really paying off.
Wow! Can we have cool nicknames too?
And together we are...
This is going to be so fun. Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
"Okay, we're ready."
"Actually, we're here to fake wrestle."
"Oh, excuse me."
Did it just get dark in here?
"Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them."
That's Wrestlese for You're dead meat.
"Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr. Krabs cheering us on."
Whoa.
"Hey, Patrick. Look, Patrick,  it's a fist."
How fun was that?
"Did you need something, Mr. Krabs?"
"Right! C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with."
"Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this?  It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it.  There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya."
"Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well."
"Patrick, are you okay?"
"Really? Me, too."
That tickles.
"Look, I'm a..."
Fake wrestling.
"Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun! Doesn't that make us winners?"
"Oh, hello, Mr. Fluffy."
"See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr. Krabs!"
"Do you know what today is, little guy?"
It's take Gary a walk in a park day!
"Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down for a sec."
"Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner!"
Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew.
"Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love.  Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out."
"One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?"
"Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye!  Night-night, Gare-Bear."
"Good morning, Gary!  Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. It was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night.  Peek-a-boo!  Huh? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself.  What's this? Some sort of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover!  Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you!"
"Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy?  Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's.  Sounds right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test.  Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary!"
Gary? Gary?!
"Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!"
"Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car."
"Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?"
"You did wander out of the house on your own? But why?  Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashioned amore!"
"That's gotta hurt, Gary."
"Don't stay out too late, Gary!  They grow up so fast."
"I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick."
"Hey, Sandy, watch me do the Grouchy Squidward."
Everybody's an idiot except for me.
"Huh?  Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down."
Like this?
My what has a what now?
"You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!"
Whew. That was close.
No!
My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!
"Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?"
"Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again."
"No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead."
I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary.
I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.
No problem!  A really long spatula.
I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.
"Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again."
Never ever ever!
Never ever never never ever ever never!!
Never ever...
"Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?"
"Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting.  I think I caught one!"
"I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny!"
"Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year."
"Huh?!  Oh, my gosh!  This can't be happening!  This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!  Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary."
"Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world.  I'm taking my  first step.  So far, so good. I think I can do this!  Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me!  I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now!  Is it too late to go back inside again?"
It's too late.  Patrick? Sandy?
I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
You know what I don't understand though?
What?
What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place?
You dropped this.
Patrick! Guess what came in the mail today!
This...
Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae!
"Look out, Mermaid Man!"
"Those are called End Credits, Patrick."
That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button!
"La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la! (playing in the bathtub. He shoots a squirt of water with his hands. The squirt of water goes through his holes at the top of his head then lands on the bar of soap) Yay! A direct hit! (uses a bar of soap as a walkie-talkie) Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, prepare to dive! Repeat: prepare to di-- (Plankton, disguised as Grandma knocks on the door. He clears his throat) Hi, lady!"
"Ehh, not really..."
"(gasps) Quick, come inside! (inside of the pineapple) Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?"
"I'm so glad you came back... (rubs his finger across Plankton's chin) ...Double-Great Grammyma. (Plankton pushes it away and shudders) You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy. (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) Okay, lean forward. (Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. (Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) How about we look through some old family photo albums? (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. (a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?"
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... (shows stacks of photo albums) ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first."
Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?
"Good morning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!"
"So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?"
Hmmmm... (flashback of Plankton)
"(goes back to the present) No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting."
"(grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him) Come on, it'll be fun! (Bubble transitions over to the place called Grandma's Tea House. SpongeBob drinks tea) Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?"
"Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?"
Why are you not having fun?
"Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. (Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta masta! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) Grandma, you getting bored?"
Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?
"Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?"
"(laughs) Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... (Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ...Squidward!"
I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.
"Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry."
"(cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) Well, here it is."
"Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties."
"Ha, ha, ha... What?"
"Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... (calls) Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dish-washing while I have the chance. (walks to the sink) The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. (turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! (the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) Oh, I can't bear to look! (starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!"
"Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?"
"Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there."
(carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash) Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.
"Sweet dreams, Grammyma. (closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up)"
"Grandma? (gasps) You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?"
Duck!
"Don't forget your condiments, Plankton."
Safe!
"Why, Mr. Krabs? Why does he hate us so?!"
Best friends?
"Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea what that went through to get here."
"Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?"
"It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?"
"Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all."
"Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?"
Sabotage!
Whoopee!
"Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this?"
"Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?"
"Well, first, you have to make a snowball."
"Sure, pal."
Patrick! How could you?
Oh yeah.
"Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!"
"I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!"
"Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down."
Score one for the boys back home!
"Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!"
Then that means he's on my side!
I'm ready!
"Okay, Patrick, it's out."
"We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children."
"Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty."
Can I be Mr. Krabs?
He's a good leader.
"Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!"
"If you're in this war, then where's your fort?"
"Forts win wars, Squidward."
"He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny."
"See, it is too small."
Exposed.
Squidward returned fire!
"Yes, Patrick?"
Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B.
"Did you hear something, Patrick?"
Night Gare-bear.
"Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up."
"Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt."
"Who are you talking to, Squidward?"
"Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse."
"Well, uh..."
Uh...you could be sick.
"Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. But that's not even the worst part."
No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.
Squidward? Squidward? Squidward!
What's the matter?
"Squidward, what could it be?"
Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?
What?
What?
Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to  go home and not come back until you're fully recovered."
"I'm so sorry, Squidward."
"Right away, Squidward."
Yes.
"Oh, this. It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink..."
"Oh, this."
"Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias."
"Hello, Squidward."
"Um, actually no."
Mr. Krabs!
Mis...ter...Krabs!
It's Squidward. He's sick.
Who was the first?
"But, Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays!"
Poor Squidward.
"My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is...  That's funny. My eyes feel itchy.  And my throat feels scratchy, too.  Itchy eyes, scratchy throat...  Even my mouth feels dry!  I've contracted... Squid's Disease!"
"Everything's fine, captain. Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure."
"If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here?  Grandma always said: 'If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.'  Or was it cold water?  Something tells me it wasn't that either. Of course! It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil!  Uh-huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities.  Oh no!"
"Yes, everything's fine in here.  Just dandy.  I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious.  This super hot spicy yellow mustard will do the trick. Well no, actually that burns real bad.  Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some—  pickles! Pickles are like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come.  Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns!"
"Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something."
"Thank you, Mr. Krabs."
But who's going to run the restaurant?
"Hi, Squidward."
"I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right, Squidward?  Squidward?"
"That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!"
"I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry."
"Wasn't that great, Squidward?"
"Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next."
"Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! You're not well enough to return to work! I can't let you!"
Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
"But, Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?"
Squid's Disease? I know just the cure!
"What a great day.  Hey, Sandy... look!  I'm Sandy!!"
"Hey Sandy, who am I?  Hello, SpongeBob? Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring."
Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas?
Coming.
"Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think?"
"All right! Stand back, everyone!"
Could I borrow a couple of these?
"And now, with the addition of two, COUNT 'EM, two marshmallows!"
I got it!  Incoming!  Oops... I guess I ripped my pants again!
"Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?"
I could use a hand here!
I guess so...  ...except I ripped my pants!
I'll take a banana split.
"That's okay, I already split my pants! Get it???"
"How about, ripple?  No, thanks, already got one.  Is that a burger you're eating?"
You know what would go good with that?
Ripped... pants...  Ripped pants a la mode!  Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants?
Come closer...  I need... I need...
A tailor.  Because I ripped my pants!!
"Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think. Your public's waiting.  Let's see...  Lifting weights - big laugh, Frisbee in face - kills, Surfing - knocks 'em dead, Pretending to drown,  Noooooooo. Come on, think. I got it! Hey, everybody!  Not ripped pants!  Pants ripped off! Huh? Someone call the police, there's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no.  We blew it, pants."
"Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?!"
Ouch.
I lost my best friend.
"When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants."
"♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪"
♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪
Sandy!
"Absolutely, buddy."
"Oh, I'm just helping out the Health Department."
"Congratulations, Plankton. In a few more years, you're sure to get an F.  Whoa!"
"Hey, catchy song."
"We need a name for this mission. How about, Journey to the Center of Karen? No. The Mainframe Mission. Nah. Ooh, I know. Operation: Save Karen."
"Oh, like this?  Oops."
"But Plankton, how am I supposed to— Whoa!"
Ow!
Whoa!  Super-awesome-ular-tastic!  Wow!  Huh?
"Plankton, I do not respond to insults."
"Got it, Honey.  Whoa!"
Huh?  Hmm.  The virus!
"Plankton, it looks like the virus is heading to Karen's memory banks."
Plankton?
"Ooh, you have beautiful eye."
"Mr. Krabs, is that you?"
"Hey, looking good, Mr. K."
"Hmm?  Uh, nothing like a little make-up couldn't fix.  Hey, I wonder if Karen has a version of me down here."
"Woop, woop, zing, zing. Woop, woop, zing, zing."
"Ooh, now that guy's a hunk."
Ow!  Yeowch!
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Duh.
Duh.
Doy.
Doy.
Duh.
Duh.
Doy.
Doy.
"Duh, duh, doy, doy. Duh, duh, doy, doy."
"Duh, duh, doy— How do I look?"
Whoops. Did I do good?
"Whoa, okay, your turn."
No!
"I mean, yes!"
"Stop munching on those memories, you monster!"
Hi-yah!
Meow?
"Plankton, I'm at the edge of Karen's memory! She has to create more memories! I need space to run."
"Oh, I'm afraid not."
"I always wind up with one extra piece.  Oh, you must be hungry. That's why you're eating through Karen."
"You poor, ugly, disgusting little virus. I know what you need."
I got the virus.  Look.
"Here you go, little fella. It'll take the virus 300 years to chew its way through this sandwich."
Just watch!
Safety pin!  Ointment!
"Aww, such a good wittle Squiddy."
"Oh, boy!"
SquarePants and Star Babysitters at your service!
Not literally.
"Bye!  Whoa! A whole liege of little darlings.  Alright, Patrick, you take East plank, and I'll take the West, and we'll try to establish a map zone in the middle."
Bring her down!
Yeah.
And they all lived happily ever after inside an oyster shell.
Babysitting!
We won't get paid if your kid's mislaid!
"Ooh!  While you go out, and dance, and drevel..."
Wait! Where's the baby?
Baby!  Baby?
"Hmm? No, I, I don't think so."
"She's nice, but she's not a baby.  Wait a minute.  I found the baby."
"Patrick, all babies are beautiful. Even the ugly ones, and we don't know the baby's name is."
What a pretty name! Little Baby Prunes.
"No, Patrick, Baby Prunes is just mimicking what she's heard. It's just baby talk. She's babbling."
Oooo! Who's a colicky baby? It's you!  Coochy coochy coo!
I'll go up and prepare a bath for Baby Prunes for when she wakes up.
"Strange... There don't seem to be any baby items in here. Hmm...  Okay, pills, pills, dentures, more pills, hemorrhoid cream.  Happy birthday to mother on her 137th birthday. Aw.  137th birthday?! Ohhhh! Baby Prunes isn't a baby, she's an old lady!"
Patrick! She's not a baby!  Where's Baby Prunes?
That was no puppy!  That was an old lady! An old lady that we're responsible for!
If you were an old lady where would you go?!
What about a sewing circle?
Come on!
Old lady Prunes?  Have you seen a baby that's really an old lady?
"No, not that."
"Ah, where's baby/old lady Prunes?"
Prunes!
Old lady baby Prunes!
"Prunes, you're alive!"
"Ahh, Pruny wants to play nice old lady"
"Ah, another job well done.  Uh, Patrick, I think she needs to be changed."
"Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had."
"Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar. You are a winner. And today's the first day of summer!Happy first day of summer, Squidward! Care to join me for solstice caroling?Walking in the grass,it's so fine,don't need shoesin the summertime!"
Yeah.
"Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?"
The money?
Oh.
Tell me more about summer break.
I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
"Almost closing time, Mr. K."
"Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there."
"See anything, Mr. Krabs?"
The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
"You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?"
"Krabby Land, sir?"
"Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?"
Stall 'em? How do I do that?
"Hey, kids!"
"No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!"
"Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?"
"Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?"
"Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh."
"Okay, uh... and now for a finale!"
"My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out."
I got 'em right where I want 'em.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
The kids are using them as... boomerangs.
What are we gonna do?
"Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!"
"Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!"
Who do you want?
When do you want him?
Yay!
I'll say you have.
"How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!"
But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
"I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago."
Yeah.
"Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer."
Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
"Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary.  Hm, can't read the return address.  Maybe this will shed some light.  Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. BlackJack.  Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!"
"That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack! The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids!"
Why should we?
"Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary!"
My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now!
"That brute has my parents! I got to get over there!  Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back."
"I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents!  Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? Do not cross? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed! NO! Get it together, SquarePants! To face BlackJack, you've got to be as tough as nails!  Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic! The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?  What's this? BlackJack smashed my family portrait! Oh, no! What has he done with my parents?!"
"That fiend! Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note.  SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm going to do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack.  He's going to get Grandma, too! I have to stop him!  Grandma, where are you? Are you okay? Grandma? You in here? Grandma?  Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp! Oh, that animal!"
Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?
But where's BlackJack?
Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?!
"Cleaning up the mess?  I got to get help! I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's! He'll know what to do.  Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help!"
I need you to help me rescue my parents!
"Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents! They're in danger!"
"Actually, I came to try to find my..."
"Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue! Please help me!"
I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!
"Listen, Uncle Captain Blue! We don't have much time. Cousin BlackJack has my parents held captive at his house!"
That's why we have to rescue them now!
"But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you!"
You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?
"Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy."
Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home.  Mother!  Mom?
"They're trapped in the basement!  Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here!"
Party?
The fumigators? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?
"So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?"
To quiver!
"Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time! THAT'S IT! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle?! Well, let's tussle it up!  Cousin BlackJack?"
That tickles!
"Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit."
"See anything yet, Patrick?"
That's me!
Thank you!
"Thirty more seconds, Patrick."
Easy... easy...
"Pretty smart, huh?"
"Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!"
"With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!"
"Sure, Squidward."
"Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!"
Let's go for it!  Gloves!
Hats!
Underwear!
"Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope."
"Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!"
"Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!"
Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
"I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!"
Our voices!
"Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!"
"No, Patrick, I can't do that!"
Because I already cut off my own arms!
"What noise, Squidward?"
"First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet..."
And...  ...imagination.
Shh!  Squidward's such a jerk.
"Where's what, Squidward?"
"We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!"
But we don't!
"Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S...  ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?"
"Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is about! It's about...  ...imagination."
"Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is!"
Arr.
Ahoy matey!
For that you'll walk the plank!
I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
"Good night, Patrick."
"Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great."
"Hey, our box is gone!"
I know! Let's go see Squidward!
Delivery!  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!  Delivery.
Never!
Delivery coming!
"Oh, I've heard of this. Davy Jones' cubicle."
"Your delivery, ma'am.  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!  Whoa!"
Whew!
"Oh, no! A delicious Krusty Krab disaster!  Call the shore patrol! Get an ambulance! Does anyone know CSR? Chocolate shake resuscitation?"
"Here! You can drink it from here! See?  It's too late. I did all I could, but it wasn't enough. I'll just clean up the remains."
"In ancient times, one would fall under sword by way of apology. We at the Krusty Krab keep that tradition.  And now that that's out of the way, I am going to give you the Krusty Krab Customer Service Pledge of Satisfaction.  I pledge to come back here tonight and clean this carpet and make it shine!  As a matter of fact, I'll clean all your offices and all your cubicles. Courtesy of the Krusty Krab."
"Thanks for lending me your cleaning cart, Patrick."
Hold on!
Oh!
Look out! Look out!
Look out! Look out!
Let's start here and make our way to the milkshake stain.
"Uh, not a problem. Uh, we'll just put 'em all back up the way they were."
There. Good as new.
"Uh, maybe this way?  Oh, uh, or this way."
Oh! Missed one.
"Hey, that's mine! I'm cleaning these offices!  Patrick, catch!"
Run!
Oh no! I'm bleeding!  It's okay. It's decaf.
"Um, eh. Look you, garbage can thing. I don't know what we did to you, but I made a Krusty Krab pledge to your boss to clean these offices."
"Hey, Patrick may be trashy,  but he's not trash!"
Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
"Sorry to do this, but you'll have to stay here until we finish cleaning.  Here. This should tie you over 'till we're done."
"Whew, finally! Patrick, meet the main stain that I disdain."
"Oh, what do you know? This cleaner contains saliva enzymes that break down chocolate particles. Hmm. You know if we wanted to, we could just—"
Make room!
"Ew. Patrick, stop sweating on me."
You again?
This is not refreshing!
Whoa!
"Hey, where'd you get the tank, Patrick?"
How did I not notice that?  We'll use these as ammunition!
"Hey, trash bot!"
SpongeBob SquarePants always keeps his word. That carpet is clean.
"You sure did, buddy! Come on, pal. Let's go get us a snack."
Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?
"Excuse me, did you just mention Glove World?"
Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!
"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
Patrick!
"But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna..."
"Patrick, wait!"
"There it is, Patrick. Glove World."
"Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World forever."
"Ooh, that looks glovely on you, Patrick."
Glove size fits all.
"You can leave a glove to gloves, but you can't make it glove."
All's fair in glove and war.
"Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!"
"Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time."
"Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl."
"Goodbye, Glove Drop."
"I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave.  Where to next, Patrick?"
The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in the entire glove kingdom. And it's the last time I'm ever gonna ride it.
"I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World close?"
"Ew, did you hear that?"
"No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!"
The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it moorings!
Uh-huh.
We have to jump before this thing crashes! Come on!
"Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!"
"Nice job, Patrick."
"Look!  Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake."
"Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality."
All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World is closing. I mean just look around you. Open your eyes.
"See what I mean, Patrick? Glove World is on its last legs."
I just wish there was something we can do.
Wait a second.  That's it!
"Of course, we just have to fix Glove World."
"Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World open. Are you with me?"
"Okay, Patrick, this is it. Do you remember what to say?"
Hall of mirrors.
It's working.
Ow!
"Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix.  Excuse me.  Much better.  Ooh.  There."
"Patrick, stop! What are you doing?"
"Listen, Patrick, do you hear that?"
"Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World, and now it's over. And they're gonna close it, and there's nothing we can do."
"We're doing what any concerned, responsible person does when they're left no other choice."
"Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!"
"Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key."
The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.
So where you keeping it?
"Well, it's the same old patty, except now each one has a pinch of chum added."
Wow!
"Oh, could I just have one more handshake, Captain?"
Ooh….
"One, two, three. One, two, three."
"The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for."
Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair.
No.  Whew.
"Squidward, you're making a big mistake!"
But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles?
I never knew you felt so strongly about it.
"Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter."
Cookies!
"Anyways, I just want you to know. If you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers. Only closer."
Or a football playing king in space... with a mustache.
"Squidward? Squidward, is that you?"
"It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together."
"There ya go. So, where you living these days?"
"Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess! Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell... you're a football player?"
A spaceman?
A football playing king in space-
Even your paintings!?
"There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed."
"Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Good night, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you."
"Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane."
"It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner?"
"Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work.  I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Good night, Gary."
Good night.
Here you go.
Good night.
Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me.
He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back.
I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough.
I KNOW HE STILL ISN'T LOOKING FOR WORK! DON'T RUB IT IN!!
"Coming, Squidward..."
"Here you go, Your Majesty."
Why not?
What about it?
"Fine, I'll just take it out."
Hmmm... that's two things in this house that won't work.
Two things that won't work!
Okay. Don't move.  Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special.
"Oh, okay. How about this?"
"Haha, ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did... at his JOB!"
...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives!
"I've got a better idea!  Why don't I call someone whose JOB it is to fix it!? You know why?! Because when I need a JOB  done, I get someone with a JOB  TO DO  THAT JOB!!"
"You want your dime back?!  TAKE IT!!! Now Squidward can come back, right?"
Then have some more dimes!  I've got plenty of 'em!
"LISTEN, YOU CRUSTACEOUS CHEAPSKATE! SQUIDWARD'S BEEN LIVING AT MY HOUSE, DRIVING ME CRAZY!  AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?!  What's that?"
This is a dime?
"So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right?"
"Oh, I've got ya now, Gary."
"Tag, you're it!  Gary will never find me here!  Uh-oh.  Tag! Now I'm it!"
Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?
"Okay,  Tag, you're it!"
That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
"Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary.  Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.  What about you, Gary?  Gary? Gary?"
"Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?"
"Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep."
"Hey, that's a great idea!"
"Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover."
"OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow."
I'm awake!
"Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?"
"Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee!  Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me?  You're not chasing me…"
"Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of…  …you… What's wrong with me?  Do I offend?  Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball!  Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip!  Huh? Huh-huh?  Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head!  All right, that's it!  Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary."
What's that supposed to mean?
"Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way, Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary!"
"Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me…  ...for all that I've done?!  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary."
"And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da.  Bon appetite, Lary.  Okay, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I…  I guess you can sleep there…  I'll sleep down here.  Well, good night, Lary.  Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?!  Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?!  Gary?"
"Oh, hello, Patrick."
"Hello, Gary."
Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…
Soap? But… we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'…
"Du… du… duuuuu…  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you!  I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?"
Gary…?
"No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!"
"G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww…  Let's go for a walk, pal!"
"Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later!  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?"
"Okay, Squidward, see ya later."
"Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later."
"Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?"
How 'bout a game of hangman?
"How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks &amp; Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings &amp; Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?"
Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own!
"Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is."
"Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name."
"How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you."
"Actually, Patrick, this is..."
"Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?"
"Order up, Mini Squid!"
"Here you go, pal!  Go get em', tiger!"
"Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?"
"But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures.  Arrivederci,  mon frere."
"Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?"
"Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!"
"You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place.  Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words.  Now to attack these floors!"
Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates.
I am.
"Yep, he's gonna have to--   What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or  Squidward!  Phew! I am taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!"
"Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement."
"Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy...  ...and it looks like it is you!"
"Squidward, wait!  We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet!"
"You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa!  Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts.  Face the facts that I'm the little guy!  And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today."
"Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it."
"Oh, what's the use, Gary?  I've lost the will to go on!   Hi, Patrick."
What happened to yours?
"Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator."
"Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, or Gary,  or for anybody!"
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.
"Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds.  Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones.  Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. Bank Teller Needed. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking.  20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97.  Order up!   What do you think, boss?"
"I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick.  I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, This is a job for a sponge. Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?"
"I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?"
"That's just a billboard, Patrick."
"I...don't think that's physically possible,  but I could audition to be a sponge model."
"Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent."
"Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?"
"Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back."
"Oh, well, want is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it.  I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick."
I did?
"Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?  ♪ Laaa! ♪  Sorry."
"Okay, getting on it.  ♪ When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim! ♪"
How'd I do?
I guess a sponge can make it in this town.  I am going to be a star!
Fantastic.
"Oh, yes I did, Patrick.  I said, You're looking at the new face of television."
"Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep."
That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.
"Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you."
"Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television."
A star's first day is his most important.
"Yippee!  I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director."
Whoa! What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's happening?!
"Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?"
Nooo!  I can't do this!
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
"Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister."
"Mr. Krabs!  Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better.  Please."
"I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go."
"Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!"
"Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else.  Ah, what a great day at work.  Huh? Yeah...  I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge...  ...Bob.  I got you now! Hi-yah!  Well, I guess the coast is clear."
I love this show!
Hi-yah!
"Hi-yah!  Uhh, just a second.  Safety first!  And now, spin technique!"
Double overhand squirrel knot!
That'll be the day.
"Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?"
"Well, it goes like this!  Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line.  Oh, yeah!  That's a good one, isn't it?  What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful...  pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet."
Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Yah.
Curses!
Oh yeah. Gotcha!
What?
Order up.
Hi-yah!
"Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!  Ssss!  Took care of her, yes I did.  Oh, ahoy, sir!"
"But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo."
"No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it."
"Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward."
"Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!"
Hah!  Sandy!
"But, Mr. Krabs."
Fired?  No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
"Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate."
"No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop."
"No, really! Please, stop!"
"Ahh, Mr. Krabs!"
"But I, uhh, she..."
Fired?
Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
"We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?"
I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Karate sure is dumb.
I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
Not karate.
"Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact..."
"For a second, that sounded like."
"Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?"
What did you say?
How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
One for you!
And one for me!
Hmm?
"Sure thing, Sandy."
Yeah?
"Uhh, sure."
Maybe just one more. Or two!
Or ten!
Right!
Right!
Time for buns!
And I'll cut the cheese!
More buns!
"Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy?  Right? I guess I'll eat one now."
In your dreams! Hi-yah!
Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
"Mr. Krabs!  Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going?  Nice day, huh?  Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me."
I love kara-tay!
"Oh, boy, the mail's here!  What do we have today?  Gas bill... taxes... letter to SpongeBob from -  Grandma!"
"Oh, Grandma's turning even older! I can't wait to celebrate!  Sorry, Gary, I am gonna miss you when I'm gone...but, if I'm not here, who's going to take care of you?"
"Hi, Squidward!"
My daddy is going away. Can you take care of me...eow?
"Gary, is that true?"
"Well, I'll see you later, Squidward."
Patrick!  Patrick?
"Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Heh, yeah. Hey, Patrick, I need to ask a favor of you."
I need you to take care of Gary.
What?
"No, that's not it! I am going to see my Grandma for her birthday, and I'm trusting my best pal to watch carefully over Gary when I'm gone."
"Okay, Patrick. There you are!"
It's a chronological list of all the things you need to do with Gary. Make sure you do each and every one.
"Oh, yeah. They're in the cupboard."
"I'm gonna miss you, little guy. But I know you are going to be in good hands."
"Okay, Gary. I'll be home by ten.  Dear Patrick, just do verify.  First, you feed Gary, then you pet Gary, then you-"
You know what? You're right.
"Oh, Grandma, you shouldn't have. It's your birthday, I should be serving you!"
"Gary. Oh, Gary."
"Grandma, can I please use your phone?"
Thank you.
"Patrick, it's SpongeBob. How's Gary?"
"Sounds like you got everything under control. Oh, and make sure to give Gary his bath."
"Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles."
And remember to dry him off really good.
And don't forget about the list!
"♪Happy Birthday dear old Grandma, Grandma, Grandma! The best Grandma in the world, Grandma, Grandma!♪"
"Grandma, can I use your phone again?"
"Just checking, is everything okay over there?"
It's SpongeBob. Is Gary all right?
"He's what? He's what, Patrick? Gary is what?!  What is happening to them?!  They need my help!  Grandma! Grandma!"
"Ooh, better get you to bed now. Good night, Grandma!"
"Hang on, Gary!  Gary!  What's the matter, buddy?  Ahh... reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see. Snail Tales, that's a good one."
It's time to grow myself large and wide.
"Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumpin' iron. Check it out."
All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set.
"Oh, really?"
"Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help."
"Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy. I can see me now.  La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la.  Goodnight, Gary."
Yeah... that would change everything!
One.
They're up.
I'm! Fee!! Ling!!! Some!!!! Thing!!!!!
"Arm-cruncher, great...  This squirrel's trying to kill me."
"Hey, that's great, Sandy, well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye.  This working-out thing, isn't working out.  Ow. Ow. Ow."
Huh?
"Wow, now that's a good idea!"
"I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone!  Hi, Squidward!"
"Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!!"
"Hi, guys."
"Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait...  They're big, aren't they?"
THANK YOU. I've been working out. Excuse me a second.  Yeah. Anyone up for the...  ...juice bar?
I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there!
"I remember when I used to look like you, too.  But, that was a long time ago."
Thank you.  Yeah...
"I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results.  Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better."
What?
"Hmmm... well... I, uhh... first I... take my hand... and I do this."
Do these muscles lie?
"Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me."
"Uhh, what do you mean?"
"Uhh, well, I'm not sure."
"Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a...  Sandy, wait!"
"Oh, no."
"Wait, Sandy... don't sign just yet!"
Wait-!
WAAAAIT!
"Sandy, wait...!"
"Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy."
"Oh, yeah. Great. No problem."
Just kidding. Just kidding... heh!
"Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp! I'm a jerk!!"
Yeah.
96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
It hurts.  1. 2. 3. 4...
...9. 10.  Can you get that?
"You're it!  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!"
"Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?"
"Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head."
"Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!  Go ahead, you get first crack."
"Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before."
"Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick!  Look, buddy, I captured one!"
Okay...what do you wanna do?
Pretty.
Fragile.
"C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!"
"I was thinking more like jumping rope,  1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab."
"How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?"
Yes!
"What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon.  Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?"
Wanna visit Squidward?
How do you know so much about music?
Does that include...  belch-talk-ing?
"Uhh, guys?"
"Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub."
"Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap!"
"Well, maybe later we can play pirates."
What? What do you mean?
"But Patrick, you're my best friend!"
Yeah.
"Goodbye... Mr... Best friend!  Sandy, you there? I need some professional help.  Patrick?"
I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!
"Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories."
"Coming...  Patrick, you're kidnapping me?"
Yay!  What should we do?
Let's do this.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Yeah!  That was fun, huh Patrick?"
It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.
"That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?"
"Patrick! Hold on, buddy!  There ya go.  Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again!  Not back there.  Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick!  Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?"
I guess we'll never have fun together again.
Yes.
"Uhh, it was right here."
"But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over...  Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy.  Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?"
"Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal.  Patrick? Say something, Patrick."
"Patrick, you're back!"
"Sounds like Squidward ate at Mario's last night.  Good thing no one's around to notice his embarrassing...  Those construction workers! Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises.  I'll cover for him! Whoa!  Sorry, fellas, this sure is a noisy trowel.  Listen to this thing!  Ah, I really should get..."
You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?
You've really made him happy.
Okay...
"Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together."
"Are you sure you don't need any help, Squidward?"
"Yes, Patrick?"
"Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa!"
"Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor."
What job is that?
"The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star.  Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm."
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. My patient is very sick."
"Wow, Squidward, they really liked you! Just don't get a swelled head."
"What's this?  It says a free prize!  Huh? Where's my prize?  Free Prize.  Offer inside! Just send in 99 box tops!  How you doing over there, Gary?"
"Send in the box tops...  ...before eating all the cereal?!?  Gary, you are a genius!"
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
We're waiting.
We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy.
"Why, sure."
Yup.  Isn't there anything else?
Guess we'll have to keep waiting.
"Me, too."
"Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone?"
"If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him."
Got to stay focused.
"Not now, I'm busy.  Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!?  So tired.  So hungry.  But... must wait... for toy."
WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?! Can't you see I'm doing something here?!  This better be good.
My birthday party?  I missed... my... birthday party?
My birthday cake.
That was my cake.  What is the present?
That stupid toy! I wasted my whole life waiting for it!
"I've been mean to Gary and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me cause... I'm a big jerk!"
"Yes, you do."
"No, Patrick, people like me don't deserve moments.  I get so caught up in..."
...in waiting for... my toy!  Whoo!
"Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
I waited so long...
And you broke it...
"Yes, yes I'm okay."
You! You ruined my free toy!
I-I ate... bo-bo-box tops. And then... I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And then he came and we're waiting. We're waiting. And then my toy and then you and then snap and then this!
"Hey, my toy's okay!"
"Look, Patrick, Squidward fixed it.  How can we ever thank you?"
"Good morning to you, too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab."
"Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater."
"We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get..."
"Ah! Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me?  Ah! Today is Sunday?! But that means..."
"Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today.  The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays.  Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have?  Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!"
I would love to.
Uh-huh.
"Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge."
Oh.
Wow...!
Nor... mal. Got it.
That stands to reason.
I respect your meticulous nature.
What's next on the list?
"Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands."
Yep.
Really sure.
"Normal.  2,692...  2,693...  2,694...  Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute.  Aha!  There... we go.  Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here.  What the...?  Ohhh! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for...  ...weeks! What is going on?!  Oh! Patrick?"
"Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks."
Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
"Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for...  P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe!"
"Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick,  I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome."
That's right. Exit the tree...
"Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun."
"Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility."
Nnnnope.
Not gonna happen.
No way.
"Yeah, right."
"Patrick, what do you take me for?"
Deal.
But you have to promise not to touch anything.
"Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex...  Patrick!   Patrick, no! You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything!"
Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!
"Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear?  Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick?"
"Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do."
Mm-hmm. What else?
And...?
Until when? Until...?
"Good boy, Patrick!"
"Yes, Patrick?"
"Patrick, how many times did we---"
"Well, I, I guess I can't handle it after all I... I'm a failure!"
"Oh yeah, what makes you say that?"
Sa..S...S..San....Sandy!  How was the inventors convention?
It is?
I never thought I go out like this.
"No, with a fishbowl on my head."
Hooray!
"Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right, Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy?   Sandy?"
"La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The Ild Ones! That's a strange name.  Scallop!  Bye Ild Ones. I like your silly name. Hmm...w. Oh, oh, they're not the Ild Ones. They must be the Wild Ones."
"No; I don't know who you are, either."
Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!
"There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!"
Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
"The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea."
"Mr. Krabs, this is serious!"
Squidward!
"A horrible biker gang called the Wild Ones are coming. We've got to run, hide!"
Uh-huh.
"Like this, Squidward?"
Patrick!
"Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom."
"Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?"
"Hello, Patrick."
"No, hide me!"
Me!
Me!
Me!
What?
Their leather socks.
"Say that again, Patrick."
"No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?"
"Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here."
"Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here."
"Patrick, that's your salivation."
"So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?"
Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
"Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?"
How about our biker organization?
What about our coalition?
"We'll just pencil you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone."
"Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab."
Then can we save the town?
"Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me!  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind!  Oh. Thanks, Squidward."
"Me? Annoying?  Yeah, right."
"Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we..."
Mild Ones?  Oh!
"Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?"
Mmm! Isn't this salt water taffy just tafflicious?
"What's the matter, Patrick?"
Maybe you should do something about that.
How does that help?
"That's it! I'm taking you to the dentist, Patrick."
"Oh, don't worry, Patrick. Dentists are our friends.  Huh? Patrick? Patrick?"
Oh.
Thank you!
"Oh boy! Aren't dentist offices fun?  Oh, they've got colorful wooden beads on wires!  Whoa, look at it go!"
"Aww, come on, Patrick.  The doctor will fix you right up."
"No, Patrick! Sit!"
Good boy. Ow!
"Oh, I wanna see!"
Aww. Coochie coo!
"Patrick, come back!"
"Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island."
Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows.
Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can be free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities.
"Of course, I guess your baby tooth could be happy in your mouth all alone by itself."
Hmm. My friendship sense is tingling. Patrick must be in trouble.
"What's the matter, pal?"
"Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says, If you can't bite, things ain't right."
Squidward!
It is not baloney!
"Squidward, why would you want to do that?"
"Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy."
"You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out."
"Patrick, wait!"
"Patrick, they weren't mine."
"Patrick, can I show you something?"
"It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth.  Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart."
"Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?"
"Patrick, you don't understand! I'm just helping to get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy!"
It's true!
"You don't believe there's a Tooth Fairy? Well, follow me and I'll show ya."
"Behold, the Tooth Ferry!"
This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island.
Of course.
"Oh, here. This is yours."
"Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal."
"Open wide, Squidward!"
"Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?"
"Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves."
Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!
"It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets."
I've got a gazillion secrets!
"Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly."
You wanna hear one of my secrets?
Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?
Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
"Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the...  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word fancy in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now."
Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
"Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?"
"But, Patrick, I must know the secret!"
"Come on, Patrick, just a peek?"
"But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!"
"So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?"
"What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?"
"Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!"
I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.
Shhh!
"Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper."
Uh…
"Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!"
"No, really, Patrick! Look!"
"If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside."
Really?
"Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?"
It's just a string.
"Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!"
I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!
"Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else."
"Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!"
"Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi..."
"Great minds think alike, I suppose."
"I may be down, but I'm not out!"
Hi-yah! Sandy?
"Oh, I get it. She's Sandy. That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!"
Ew.
"Yeah, let's go in."
Wow.
How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...
"Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes."
Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
"What weenies. Oh, brother."
What? But I'm not a weenie!
That's impossible!
I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!
"So, your name's Reg?"
"Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!"
"Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?"
"I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?"
"Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap."
"Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch."
I am not a weenie!
My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.
"Patrick, what're you doing here?"
I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon!
I've got no choice.
"Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!"
"Afternoon, Reg."
"Well, that makes me pretty mad."
Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
"Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny."
"I, uh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!"
"Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!"
"I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!"
"Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?"
I did?
"Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?"
I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
Weenie Hut General?
"Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs.  He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab."
"Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a  Krabby Patty?"
"Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs! Plankton was-- right."
I cleaned it this morning.
"Nope, she's perfectly aligned."
Puppets!
Boo! Hiss!
"I'll do my best, sir."
Mr. Krabs!
"Mr. Krabs, it's awful! We're all out of buns!"
"Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd."
One Krabby Patty to go.   Here you are.
"Uh, Mr. Krabs?"
Take a look.
That's my Krabs!
"Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?"
"This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?"
"You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven."
"I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles."
"Yes, please."
I have no talent.
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
"If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art."
"How's this, Squidward?"
"Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy."
"Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom."
"I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time..."
"I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen."
How's this Squidward?
"Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!"
"But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!"
"Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness."
Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them.
Really?
Really?
Really?
Wow...  Really?
"Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!"
I... can't!
"I did it, Squidward."
"I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book."
"That's not in the book, either."
"Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it!  There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da!"
"First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept."
I've gotta embrace the marble!
I've gotta sniff the marble!
I've gotta lick the marble!
I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
"With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!"
"But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.  ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.♪"
"Hi.  Gary, I feel funny inside."
Yow!
Hello.
"Gary, there's something inside of me."
You see anything?
"Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?"
"Oh, hello."
"Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you Prickles!"
I see you!
"Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a pet—Gary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one."
"Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't want to hear the little guy cry."
Such a sad story.
"Okay, little buddy, but just for one night."
"Nighty-night, Prickles."
Huh?
"Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited?  I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends!"
Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
"Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work."
Guys? Guy—guys?
"Gary, calm down. We're all friends here."
"Ow!  Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!"
"Gary, I need to take a shower."
"All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job."
"I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir."
"I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second?  Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please."
Squatters rights? What the heck is squatters rights?
"It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me."
What am I gonna do?
"Yeah, and I lost my job over it."
"Anything, Plankton! Anything!"
You gotta help me!
"No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—"
Aw! Hmm?
Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!  I need a hug!
Does that mean no hug?
"Well, this is my life from now on, huh?  Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms!"
"Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one."
"Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!"
It's  driving test day!
"Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it.  What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong.  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time."
"Yeah. It's a good thing too. One more crash and you would've popped for sure. Here, let me take that wheel."
"Hey, Mrs. Puff. How are you feeling?"
"Hm, from now on, I guess we'll have to call you Mrs. Pop!"
Mrs. Puff! What are you doing!?
"I'm sorry! Stop, Mrs. Puff!  That tickles!"
"Sheesh! I don't know what she is so upset about!  I think she looks better this way! If I always say, it's duh doy. ."
"Hello, Mrs. Puff. Are we feeling any better?"
I see you got the flowers I sent.
"Ah, this room is so dark and depressing!  You need sunlight! ."
"Up and at 'em!  Y'know what will make you feel better, Mrs. Puff? A nice peaceful stroll! ."
Excuse me! Doctor! What's up with those guys?
What's so funny?
Hooray!
"Look out, extra credit! Here I come!"
"Huh?  Oh, dear. I think I'm in that fellow's way.  Engage turn signals. Adjust mirrors. Hands at ten and two, and finally floor it. ."
"Put her in drive? Thanks, Mrs. Puff, you're the best!"
Mrs. Puff! It's you!  And you're all puffy again! Now everything's back to normal!
"Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!"
"Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged."
I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...
"I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain!  Hey,   that gives me an idea."
"Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!"
"Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man."
"Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't want to upset Squidward."
"Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and-"
What are you doing?
"Patrick, you have to play it where it lands."
"You know, Patrick, this is just a game."
I think you're missing the point.
Okay.
"Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots."
"All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now."
"Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot."
Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you.  Oops.
"Oh, where did our balls go?!"
"Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point."
But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!
"Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?"
Now where is that darn ball?
"Patrick, have you seen my ball?"
M-hmm.
"Patrick, you ate my ball?"
"Patrick, no."
"I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?"
There it is!
Play it where it lies.
I could do that blindfolded.
Aha!
Patrick...
"Patrick, this is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick...!"
What are you doing?
Would you please get back in the game?
"Those balls have got to be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick."
Play it where it lies?
But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
"Okay, you're good to go."
This one's for all the marbles.
"No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game."
Good morning.
"Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?"
Rematch next Saturday?
"Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge!"
"Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going."
"I didn't say anything, either."
"Alright, quit messing with me! I know you said something."
It's a baby scallop.
"No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet."
"No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him."
"You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat  in the house."
Is it true? Are you hungry?
I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?
Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.
Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before.
French fries?
All we have left is this apple.
Of course! Scallops love worms.
"Well, you should be good for the rest of the..."
"I don't know! Aww, don't cry."
"Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah! Look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!"
How did you know?
"Wow, I'm sure glad you're here."
"You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves."
"I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt."
Yeah.  Shh!
"Yes, Patrick?"
Me neither.
"Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready."
"Yes, Patrick?"
Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full.
Going? Where are you going?
You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Okay.
"Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby."
Huh?
"Patrick, what about my break?"
"Uhh, okay, tomorrow."
"Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break."
"Patrick, I really need my..."
Patrick?
Uhhh?
"Patrick Star, we need to talk."
"Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man!"
You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
"Yeah, once."
Hmmm?
Hmmm?
Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm?!
"So, what's the plan for the day?"
"Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock."
Six o'clock.
Six o'clock.
Six o'clock.
"Oh, nothing."
Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
No.
"Does...  You can take the night off, pal!  ...ring a bell?"
What?!  Where do you think you're going?
Work?!
"So, this is work?"
"Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase!"
OVERTIME?!
"Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!"
And that's the kind of work you're doing?
"Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!"
​You never help! NEVER!
"Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window."
Did you catch him?!
Junior? He's flying!
Goodbye!
"Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore."
"Despite all we've been through, it was worth it."
"I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!"
"Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire."
"Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!"
But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds.
"Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? Plan Your Own Party Kit? Hey Lou, how much?"
"Let's see Gary, according to the Plan Your Own Party Kit, invitations are the first order of business."
"A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success. Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends."
"Boy, Gary, this Plan Your Own Party Kit is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world!  My piñata!  Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  The Plan Your Own Party Kit suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs."
"Good question Gary, but not to worry. The Plan Your Own Party Kit warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!"
"And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever!"
"Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come!  Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00.  Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late."
"Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?"
Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!
"So, the punch okay?"
"Hmm, nice weather we're having."
"Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome, Mr. Krabs!"
"Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch."
"Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!"
"What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick."
"Squidward, you made it!"
"Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that."
"I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!"
"Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!"
"Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously."
"Hey, Gare, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to  work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?"
"Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?"
"Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it."
"Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!"
"Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!"
What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!
Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!
"Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet.  I hope they don't touch my special comb."
"I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!"
"I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but...  ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!"
"I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!"
"Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been."
"But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police."
Is it too late to offer you some punch?
"All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster."
It was?
I am?
"SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time."
"Good night, Gary."
"Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood."
"Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that."
"Patrick, what are you talking about?"
"Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!"
What's that?
"Well, you're a bigger one!"
What?
"Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway!  Aww, tartar sauce!"
"Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary?  Gary?"
"Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat!  Uhh...  The gang's all here...  Ohhh!"
"Oh, boy, now's my chance!"
"Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!"
Hang on! I'll save you!
Hold on!
Friend...
"Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for.  So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!"
"Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years!  Give me an A, buddy!  Squidward is my best friend in the world.  Squidward is my best friend in the sea..."
Squidward...
"And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer!  Umm, I can fix this."
"...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!"
"What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy?  Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and...  ...rubber bath toys!"
"You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of..."
Buddy!
"Where'd ya go, friend?"
Squidward.  A dinner party? I'd love to!  Did you miss me?
"I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy...  Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!"
"Yes, please!  Thanks, friend."
"Thanks, best friend!"
"Wait, I need some more!"
There ya go. More please!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
Squidward!
"Guess what, Squidward?"
Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
"Psst, I think he's jealous."
Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.  Bubble wand.  Mesh tank top.  And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.
I can.
Science!
But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.
Safety first.
"Uh, why you!"
Thanks!
"Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying!  Whoop!"
Home run!
Patty melt.
Aww.
"Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here.  How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?"
Ooh!  One giant leap for SpongeKind.
"Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm..."
"Oh, sure.  I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains."
"Um, did someone say, Man on the Moon?  Hello?  Intelligent life?  How about average smarts?  I'd settle for common sense!  Ooh! Intelligent footprints.  Huh?  Wha-hoo!  I found it! I found it!"
Intelligent life.
"Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating"
You bet! Just call me LunchBob.
"Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is."
"No!  No, not launch! Lunch!"
"Oh, uh, Sandy!  Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses."
"Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me.  Come on, Sandy, bring it on in."
Huh?
Squidward? You're the man on the moon?
"Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes..."
I was gonna say laughter follows.
"Good question, Mr. Claus."
Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.
Now we just wait for a gust of wind.
Why don't we just push the moon back?
"Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure."
Jack-in-the-box.
"Oh, oh! Let me try!"
